## Introduction

The 2016 presidential election is one of the most contentious elections in American history. A political outsider, despite losing the popular vote, manage to overcome his establishment counterpart. This victory brought success across the board for the GOP party, with a large majority in both the House and the Senate. It also allowed them the ability to secure two supreme court nominations. With this success, Trump has now become the symbol of the party, meaning that the public's perception of him directly reflects the public's perception of the Republican party.

The midterms of 2018 reveal this fact clearer than ever, with a sharp swing to the democrats in the house of representatives. In figure I below, the vote counts for every congressional district are shown, as well as which party won the district and if the district's representative endorsed trump in 2016. The first year 2014 is shown to give a comparison to how different the 2018 midterm elections were in comparison to years past. If play it hit on the graphic, or the year scroll bar is used, a depression can clearly be seen in the change between 2016 to 2018 of the republicans that endorsed trump. While not highlighted specifically, most of the maroon dots that are now cleary among democratic districts represent the several endorsers who lost their seat in the election.
