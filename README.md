## Introduction

The 2016 presidential election is one of the most contentious elections in American history. A political outsider, despite losing the popular vote, manage to overcome his establishment counterpart. This victory brought success across the board for the GOP party, with a large majority in both the House and the Senate. It also allowed them the ability to secure two supreme court nominations. With this success, Trump has now become the symbol of the party, meaning that the public's perception of him directly reflects the public's perception of the Republican party.
