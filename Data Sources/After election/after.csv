I am very, very thrilled to be here in the great State of Texas -- right on the banks of the legendary Rio Grande, where by the -- well, I don't know, you heard, right? Today we started a big, beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande. Right smack on the Rio Grande."
00:00:53 - 00:01:53 (60 sec),"I love this state and I love the people of this state. We've had a great romance together. You know, that. It's been a great romance and we're only getting stronger together. That's what's happening. Wow, look at all the press back. You believe that? [Audience Boos] This is like the Academy Awards used to be, used to be. They've gone down a long way since they started hitting us a little bit, right?"
00:01:53 - 00:02:38 (45 sec),"They've gone down. That was a long -- that was a long fall, but there they are. Last week I was honored to stand in the House Chamber to deliver the State of the Union -- and I asked both parties to come together to choose greatness for America. Since taking office two years ago our economy is now the hottest economy anywhere on Earth."
00:02:38 - 00:03:16 (39 sec),"Our military, which desperately needed funding, we went $700 billion and $716 billion, is More powerful than ever before. That was not a good situation. It was tired and depleted. Our great warriors were not taken care of. Now they're taken care of again the way they should be. And America is winning again."
00:03:16 - 00:04:11 (54 sec),"Isn't that nice? We're fighting for all Americans, from all backgrounds of every age, race, religion, birthplace, color, creed. We're fighting for ourselves. We're fighting for all Americans. And what is it, America first? Remember, it's America first. [Audience chants USA] Our agenda is not a partisan agenda, although some people say it is. [Audience member calls out We love you] Every once in a while it does become that way."
00:04:11 - 00:04:53 (42 sec),"Right? It's a mainstream, common sense agenda of the American people. It's where we want to be and where we want to go. And despite the fact that the media refuses to acknowledge what we've done and how well we're doing it -- [Audience Boos] -- a new poll just came out as I was coming on and it shows -- I don't know how you can do this, I don't think I've had a good story in years. [Audience laughs]"
00:04:53 - 00:05:17 (24 sec),"I don't get good -- I used to get great press until I decided to run for office. And we have done together, an incredible job. And a new poll just came out today Rasmussen, one of the most respected polls, one of the polls that got the election right, so I have to remember that, you know what the number is, 52 percent, with no good news."
00:05:17 - 00:05:50 (33 sec),"Explain that. Explain that. Explain that. How do you get that when you don't get good press? I guess 93 percent of the stories are negative. No matter what we do, they figure out a way to make it bad. [Audience Boos] Like, I'll give you a quick example. When I came in, North Korea was -- it looks like it was going to war."
00:05:50 - 00:06:22 (31 sec),"You know that. It was going to happen, bad things. Now you have no missile launches. You have no rocket testing. You have no nuclear testing. I have a good relationship, maybe even a great relationship. We have tremendous sanctions on North Korea. But we have our hostages back. We have -- remains are coming back."
00:06:22 - 00:06:47 (25 sec),"Remains. And our presidents have been dealing with North Korea for many, many decades, many, many decades. And on a nuclear way over the last 20, 30 years and all I hear is, ""Can't you move faster?"" You know what? I left Singapore 15 months ago, they've been negotiating for 85 years or something. So now their complaint is, ""What's taking him so long?"" I heard one of our great geniuses from a previous administration telling me how to negotiate with North Korea when they got taken advantage of like nobody I've ever seen before. [Audience Boos]"
00:06:47 - 00:06:56 (9 sec),"So some day, with all of us, this is all of us -- and those hats are beautiful, by the way -- Someday -- True. Someday they're going to appreciate us all. And I'm going to Vietnam, to Hanoi, in the near future, 27th and 28th of February, to have another summit and hope we -- hopefully we do as well with the second summit as we did with the first."
00:06:56 - 00:07:07 (10 sec),"I hope so. Now, we're delighted and I'm delighted to be joined this evening by the Texas leaders. You have great leaders, great people, great help to me -- that are at the forefront of this incredible American Revolution. You know, there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. We have to understand."
00:07:07 - 00:07:28 (22 sec),"There's never been. If you would say, as an example, that tonight, 69,000 people signed up to be here. Now, the arena holes 8,000, and thank you fire department, they got in about 10, thank you fire department, appreciate it. But if you want to really see something go outside, tens of thousands of people are watching screens outside."
00:07:28 - 00:07:48 (19 sec),"Tens of thousands. And we were all challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz. [Audience Boos] And then they said, ""You know what? Hey, you're supposed to win in order to run. By the way, we, I, we, I'm one and one, I'm one for one. Think of it. We had one election, we won, now we're going to be 2 for 0 and everything's going to be perfect."
00:07:48 - 00:08:05 (18 sec),"But a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name, he has -- he challenged us. So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too good. In fact, what I do, what I would do is I would say, ""that may be the end of his presidential bid,"" but he did challenge us. So I want to introduce some great people."
00:08:05 - 00:08:35 (29 sec),"Your Governor, Greg Abbott. Greg. Where is he? Where's Greg? Thank you Greg. And a great governor and a great friend of mine. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick.

00:08:35 - 00:09:05 (30 sec),"Thank you, Sid. Thank you, everybody. Thanks, Ken. Great job you do. And we're especially grateful to your wonderful Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Great Senators.

00:09:05 - 00:09:35 (30 sec),"Pete Olson. Pete. Thanks, Pete. Thank you, Pete. Michael Burgess. Thanks Michael. John Carter. Brian Babin. And Randy Weber. Thank you very much. We are in the midst of an economic miracle. That's what's happened. You look all over the world and you study and you see what's going on. You can look at China."
00:09:35 - 00:10:22 (47 sec),"We have a team right now in China, they want to make a deal very badly. Those tariffs are costing them a lot of money and they're going into our Treasury, remember that, we're filling up with billions of dollars. And did you see the, you know, I haven't been here very long, the trade deficit really went down very big this last month, and people are saying, ""Whoa."" I told you so. That's what I do. That's what I do. And we don't want China to have a hard time."
00:10:22 - 00:10:49 (27 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. I -- I can only tell you this, we're going to make great deals on trade. We're going to make great deals on military. When we defend another nation that's rich they have to help us out. Do we agree? They have to help us out. And they're doing it. They're doing it. You saw South Korea, they were paying us $500 million a year."
00:10:49 - 00:12:15 (86 sec),"I say you got to do more. You got to give more. Anyway. Now they're up to almost $900 million, that was like a do phone calls. I said -- I said, ""Why didn't they do this before?"" They said, ""Nobody ever asked. Nobody asked."" You pick up almost $500 million a year, nobody asked. We're defending rich countries, they've got to help us out, folks."
00:12:15 - 00:12:31 (16 sec),"They've got help us out, sorry. And you know what? They're going like us more and maybe more importantly, they going to respect us. Since the election, we have created 5.3 million new jobs, including more than a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing was dead? They said manufacturing was dead, the previous administration."
00:12:31 - 00:12:51 (20 sec),"You'll never have it. You need the magic wand. That's what they said. We obviously, we found the magic wand. And by the way, those numbers is small compared to what's happening, compared to all of the companies that are moving in. The unemployment -- [Audience Boos, chants USA] Thank you very much. Thank you."
00:12:51 - 00:13:18 (27 sec),"The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have reached the lowest level in the history of our country. [Audience chants Trump] Okay, thank you. Thank you. Are you all right? Everything okay? Please. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And women have filled almost 60 percent of the new jobs created last year, which were a record number."
00:13:18 - 00:13:41 (23 sec),"We passed massive tax cuts for working families and we canceled a record number of job killing regulations. That's why your oil and gas is coming back. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate. And to give critically ill patients access to life saving treatments, we did something that they haven't been able to do for a long time, we passed Right To Try."
00:13:41 - 00:14:07 (26 sec),"Right To Try. That's an incredible thing, Right To Try. You know, we have the greatest doctors and research in the world, and if somebody was terminally ill they traveled to Asia, they traveled to Europe, they'd travel all over the world, if they had the money. If they didn't have the money, they'd just go home, there was nothing they could do. And I said, ""Wait a minute."
00:14:07 - 00:14:30 (22 sec),"We have drugs in the pipeline that are showing tremendous progress. If somebody is terminally ill let's let them have access to our drugs. Let's let them have access."" And it's much tougher than you would think. But we got it and people, you will not understand, nobody understands, the lifesaving effects, it's incredible what's going on. They are getting better."
00:14:30 - 00:15:35 (65 sec),"People are getting better that were thinking they were going to die. It's right to try, I love it. I always wondered why we didn't do it before? Now, the people in Texas won't care much about this, but the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on Earth. I didn't think you'd care about that."
00:15:35 - 00:15:57 (22 sec),"I didn't think Texas would care about that. And listen to this, and Texas oil production is now at the highest level it's ever been. And only for the great oil professionals in the room, we're getting those pipelines approved so fast you'll be able to practically double up on oil production, oil and gas."
00:15:57 - 00:17:06 (69 sec),"They're getting approved at record levels and record time, that means more money, more security, and more independence for our country -- it's very simple. Another one they said could never get passed, they've been trying to do it for 40 years, we passed VA Choice, Veterans Choice. So that now, rather than waiting online for five days, for nine days, for three weeks -- [Audience Boos, Chants USA] Where do these people come from?"
00:17:06 - 00:17:34 (28 sec),"Where do they come from? They go back home to Mommy. They get punished when they get home. [Audience chants Build that wall] Now, you really mean finish that Wall, because we've built a lot it, steady and slowly. But before we get to the Wall, so VA Accountability and VA Choice. Accountability, we couldn't fire anybody from the Veterans Administration."
00:17:34 - 00:17:56 (22 sec),"We couldn't fire anybody. They could treat our veterans badly. We had to take it. Now, you get rid of them. And VA Choice, they'd wait online for days and weeks, they couldn't see a doctor. Now, they go out, they have a choice. They get a private doctor. They have things taken care of and we pay their bill."
00:17:56 - 00:18:29 (33 sec),"They've been trying to get those two things fixed for many, many decades, many years and we got it fixed. We also passed the Farm bill for wonderful farmers, ranchers, and growers. Just got it. We just got it passed and that was it easy but we got it passed. We had to do it. Our farmers are great. So we just get that done, farmers, ranchers, growers."
00:18:29 - 00:18:50 (21 sec),"And we passed historic legislation to combat the Opioid Crisis. [Audience chants Trump] Thank you. [Audience Boos, Audience chants hey, hey, hey, goodbye, as an audience member is removed from the coliseum] Thank you. Is there any place that's more fun to be that a Trump rally, is there any place? You know, they all said, ""Mr. President, we loved the tone of your State of the Union speech."" Some people said it was a great speech."
00:18:50 - 00:19:29 (39 sec),"Some people said, ""Really a great speech."" I said, ""But if I ever did that in El Paso, Texas, it wouldn't work here too well,"" do you agree? Nice and calm. No, that's not what you're looking for. This is more fun. This is more fun. And we just signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. Nobody thought that was going to be happening."
00:19:29 - 00:19:48 (19 sec),"In my address last week, I asked lawmakers in both parties to cross the aisle and join together for the common good for all Americans. Democrats have to stop being so angry. They're angry. And they've got to start being partners to keep this -- really, look, is just an incredible miracle that's going on? We want to keep it going."
00:19:48 - 00:20:10 (22 sec),"Keep it going, and it will keep going. It will keep going. There's so much to celebrate in our country, the economy, the military, so many things we've done scientifically. The world is trying to copy what we've done, they're not going to be able to do it. Not anymore. They were catching up fast, now they're going in the wrong direction."
00:20:10 - 00:22:05 (115 sec),"Wrong direction. Unfortunately, many of the Democrats in Congress responded to my call for bipartisan cooperation by instead choosing really -- hey, look, did you ever see anything -- radical resistance, it's the radical left. But maybe it'll change. [Audience Boos] Maybe it'll change. It all has to do with 2020 and the election."
00:22:05 - 00:22:19 (15 sec),"But I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of ""Let's hop a train to California."" [Audience Boos] Of you're not allowed to own cows anymore. You know, a lot of problems. A lot of problems. But nobody's ever had this. And by the way with us, we handle it. No president should ever have to go through what we've gone through in the first two years."
00:22:19 - 00:22:35 (15 sec),"It's a hoax. It's a disgrace, and it should never be allowed to happen again. A hoax. Just recently, as an example, Senator Richard Burr, from the great State of North Carolina. He's chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and they've been investigating this Russia hoax for two years. [Audience Boos] Think of it. They've interviewed over 200 people."
00:22:35 - 00:22:55 (20 sec),"They've studied hundreds of thousands of documents and pages and Richard just announced that they found no collusion between Donald Trump and Russia collusion. The fact is, that the real collusion was between Hillary and the Democrats and the other side with Russia, that's where the collusion is. That's where the collusion is. [Audience chants Lock her up] That's starting to make a lot more sense."
00:22:55 - 00:24:44 (109 sec),"But that's where the collusion is, with the Democrats, and with Russia, and with others. And by the way, there's also collusion between the Democrats and the fake news right here. [Audience Boos] And they know it better than anybody. Too many Democrats are focused on tearing down their opposition instead of building up our country."
00:24:44 - 00:25:27 (43 sec),"They're trying to impose some of the most extreme measures and policies ever put forward by our Congress. And by the way, I don't think anybody in this room wants to pay 70, 80, 90 and 95 percent tax. Does anybody want to pay a 90 percent tax? [Audience Boos] You know, you look at what we've done with jobs, what we've done with the economy, how low your taxes are, the lowest they've been almost from the beginning, who the hell wants to change what we're doing now?"
00:25:27 - 00:25:52 (25 sec),"We are a hot, hot country. Last week they introduced a massive government takeover that would destroy our incredible economic gains. They introduced the so-called Green New Deal. [Audience Boos] It sounds like a high school term paper that got a low mark. [Audience laughs] It would shut down American energy, which I don't think the people in Texas are going to be happy with that. [Audience Boos]"
00:25:52 - 00:26:14 (22 sec),"It would shut down a little thing called air travel. [Audience Boos] How do you take a train to Europe? [Audience laughs] You know, this -- this crazy senator from Hawaii, they said, ""Do you like it?"" ""Yes, I like it very much."" Oh, really, how are we getting to Hawaii on a train? [Audience laughs] She didn't think about that one but she's thinking about it. She'll figure it out."
00:26:14 - 00:26:42 (27 sec),"They want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home, and put millions of Americans out of work, spend $100 trillion, which by the way, there's no such thing as $100 trillion, you have to spend $100 trillion -- And remember this, no other country except us is going to do it. That's a little problem, too."
00:26:42 - 00:27:17 (35 sec),"While the world's real polluters, like China, would get many of our companies and factories, they'd just move into China, move into other parts of the world. That's the way the system works. It's not going to happen folks. Don't worry, it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. $100 trillion. Let's spend $100 trillion."
00:27:17 - 00:27:46 (29 sec),"Let's rip down every building in New York City and rebuild it environmentally slightly better. To pave the way for socialism, Democrats are calling for massive tax hikes and the complete elimination of private health care. Many of us have private health care. That means you can stand on line for five days as you wait for a doctor that is not nearly as talented as your doctor."
00:27:46 - 00:28:10 (24 sec),"Remember? ""You can keep your doctor."" Remember that? 28 times, ""You can keep it."" That didn't happen. It turned out to be alive. Hey, where are the fact checkers? You know, some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact checkers. 28 times, ""You can keep your doctor."" That didn't turn out to be what he said."
00:28:10 - 00:29:31 (81 sec),"They're coming for your money and they're coming for your freedom and it'll never happen and it won't even come close, folks. Democrats are also pushing extreme late-term abortion. [Audience Boos] Allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. What's that all about?"
00:29:31 - 00:29:48 (18 sec),"So in Virginia, the governor, he's got a little publicity lately. [Audience laughs] I like it. It keeps us out of the papers. I like it. I'd like to find a few more guys like this one. He almost moon walked. His wife stopped him, ""Darling, that would be inappropriate."" I want to see somebody trying to imitate Michael Jackson in the moonwalk."
00:29:48 - 00:30:18 (30 sec),"This would not have been a good scene. His wife saved him, darling, this would be inappropriate."" I think she was right. But the governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable. And then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby."
00:30:18 - 00:30:53 (34 sec),"Execute the baby. [Audience Boos] Incredible. Millions of innocent, beautiful babies are counting on us to protect them and we will. That is why last week I go I called on Congress, with your great congressman over there -- thank you, fellas -- to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion."
00:30:53 - 00:31:13 (20 sec),"And that certainly is extreme. Many people never even heard of it. I mean, have you ever even hear of anything like this? [Audience calls out No] Democrats must also address the double standard on full display in Virginia. By the way, that state's going to go Republican pretty soon, I'm pretty sure -- because the Democrat Party has never been more outside of the mainstream."
00:31:13 - 00:31:36 (23 sec),"They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders, and crime. [Audience Boos] This weekend, some Democrats even proposed a measure that would force the release of thousands of criminal illegal aliens -- [Audience Boos] -- including dangerous felons convicted of rape, sex trafficking, violent assault, and even murder, into our country."
00:31:36 - 00:32:06 (31 sec),"Can you believe this? [Audience Boos] Their proposal would put a hard cap on the number of illegal aliens that are brave ICE officers, we love our ICE officers -- can detain and thus remove, forcing thousands of criminals to be set free into United States communities. I don't think so. Okay. I don't think so. And I want to thank our ICE offices."
00:32:06 - 00:32:51 (45 sec),"What they put up is incredible and that includes Border Patrol and that includes law enforcement. Let's face it. Law enforcement, we love them. They keep us safe. In the last two years alone, ICE officers have made 200, listen to these numbers, 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 40,000, 40,000 larcenies 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 12,000 vehicle thefts, 11,000 robberies, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 murders. [Audience Boos]"
00:32:51 - 00:33:10 (19 sec),"-- murders, murders, killings, murders. [Audience chants Build that wall] We will. We will. If we cut detention space, we are cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country. Slashing ICE tension is the first step of many for the far left, I call them the radical left We will never abolish ICE."
00:33:10 - 00:33:44 (34 sec),"They want to abolish ICE. We're never going to abolish ICE. So let me say very clearly to those pushing this ridiculous and radical agenda, I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country. And I will never abolish or in any way mistreat our great heroes from ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement, never."
00:33:44 - 00:34:12 (28 sec),"We will always stand with those brave men and women. We will always be with them. We're going to take care of them just like they take care of us, remember that. Now, I have to tell you, as I was walking up to the stage they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we're building the Wall anyway."
00:34:12 - 00:35:10 (58 sec),"They say that progress has been made, interesting. Just now. Just now. I said, ""Wait a minute. I got to take care of my people from Texas. I got to go. I don't even want to hear about it."" I don't want to hear it. So I don't know what they mean ""progress is being made significant"". Now, what did happen is the Democrats were being hit really hard on the concept of releasing criminals into our society, that has not been playing well."
00:35:10 - 00:35:35 (25 sec),"So maybe progress is being made, maybe not. But I had a choice, I could have stayed out there and listened or I could have come out to the people of El Paso in Texas. I chose you. I chose you. So -- so we probably have some good news. But who knows? Who knows? We'll -- we're -- we're setting the stage folks."
00:35:35 - 00:36:22 (47 sec),"You know what it's called, right? It's called with setting the stage. We're setting the table. We're doing whatever we have to do the walls being built, it'll continue. It's going at a rapid pace. The Rio Grande, it's happening, go check it out. We proudly welcome those who come lawfully, and support our values in the United States, and that want to strengthen our society and help us with all of the companies moving into the United States, moving back, they left us now they're moving back, many of them, in some cases, maybe all of them, but they all want to come back because the United States is where the action is, very simple. [Audience chants USA]"
00:36:22 - 00:37:00 (38 sec),"It's where the action is. And it is -- we're most proud of the fact, you look at the car companies, they're moving back. They're going into Michigan. They're going into Pennsylvania. They're going back to Ohio. So many companies are coming back. And by the way, that's why I want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit."
00:37:00 - 00:37:29 (29 sec),"Through merit, so they can help us build our country. Make America Great Again, pretty soon we're going to be saying, Keep America Great, Keep America Great. Pretty soon. Pretty soon, congressman, Keep America Great. We'll have to switch over. Tell me, tell me, the campaign's sort of started because you have these people that nobody ever heard of, they're all running for office."
00:37:29 - 00:38:19 (50 sec),"I said, ""Who is that?"" ""Well, that person was a mayor of a city that was defeated."" Well, how about Beto, Beto was defeated to, right? [Audience Boos] But he suffered a great defeat. Watch what the news does tomorrow, though, they won't mention the disparity. They won't mention the disparity tomorrow. They'll say, ""Beto O'Rourke,"" That's his last name, right, O'Rourke?"
00:38:19 - 00:38:58 (38 sec),"Beta O'Rourke had a wonderful rally of about 15 people. [Audience laughs] No, when they get honest, when the media starts becoming honest, and maybe they will, because we've done something that's never been done before, we have suffered a totally dishonest media and we've won and it's driving them crazy."
00:38:58 - 00:39:36 (38 sec),"It's driving them crazy. It's driving them crazy but look at them, they still come. I've never said anything like it. But illegal immigration hurts all Americans, including millions of legal immigrants, by driving down wages, draining public resources, and claiming countless innocent lives. You see what's going on, folks."
00:39:36 - 00:40:37 (61 sec),"You know what's going on. They give you all of these phony stats they say, ""Oh, it's the same. It's the same."" It's not the same. It's a bad situation going on and we've stopped it. We are taking out thousands and thousands of people from MS-13, we're bringing them to hell out of our country, thousands. But if we had proper border security, including a very powerful wall, we wouldn't have to work so hard and it would be a lot safer and a lot better."
00:40:37 - 00:41:13 (36 sec),"My Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration, while modernizing our legal immigration system, which has been in terrible shape for many, many decades to prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves for them actually and contribute to our economy, people that come in on merit, merit, merit -- instead of random lotteries and chain migration."
00:41:13 - 00:41:39 (26 sec),"Chain migration, that's another beauty. [Audience Boos] We want a merit based system for entry, this will improve living conditions for all Americans living here today, both immigrant and U.S. born, everybody's going to be happy. And we need the people to take care of these companies that are moving. Our unemployment rate, real unemployment, 3.6, 3.7 -- and going down, had a little blip because of a thing called the shutdown."
00:41:39 - 00:42:47 (68 sec),"But remember, it went up to 4.0. I said, ""Boy, that's -- "" Do you know how low 4.0 is? Do you know anybody else, any other president that would have said, ""Please give me 4.0, please?"" [Audience laughs] We had a little blip, it went up from 3.7 to 4.0, just quickly. But you know what? If we didn't do that shutdown we would not have been able to show this country these politicians, the world, what the hell is happening with the border."
00:42:47 - 00:43:19 (33 sec),"That was a very important thing we did. And the fact is, illegal immigration is a heartbreaking human tragedy. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the very long and dangerous journey north up to our country. Sex traffickers, these are the worst human beings on Earth, exploit our porous border to sell young girls and women into modern day slavery."
00:43:19 - 00:44:21 (62 sec),"You wouldn't even know that, nobody knows that. And by the way, do you think they come in through the ports of entry? [Audience calls out No] I listen to the Democrats, let me nice, just say the Democrats, I won't be specific, and they say, ""Oh, everything comes through the port."" They don't do that. They drive out where there's no barrier, no wall, they make a left."
00:44:21 - 00:44:56 (34 sec),"Congratulations, you're in the United States. That's all. If you have three women tied up in the backseat of a car, you're not going through, folks, a port of entry where they do look in the backseat, at least, right? Drugs pouring through the border kills tens of thousands of innocent Americans a year, including heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, and so many others."
00:44:56 - 00:45:31 (35 sec),"They come through the Southern border. We have a drug problem over the last 6, 7, 10 years like we have never had before. We can have such a big cut in the numbers, in the percentages, if we get the Wall built -- if we have a strong Wall with other things, but we need the Wall and it has to be built and we want to build it fast."
00:45:31 - 00:46:02 (30 sec),"The number of illegal immigrants crossing our borders is so large that we've know where to hold them. We have to build -- they want buildings, they want jails. They want, these people, how about the word caravan? [Audience Boos] Caravan, I think that was one of mine, but it looked like a caravan. Where you have thousands and thousands of people coming from Guatemala, from Honduras, and El Salvador, and they march up through Mexico."
00:46:02 - 00:46:26 (24 sec),"And by the way, if we didn't have walls in those areas, in some cases that we put up, in many cases where we reinforced, in many cases where our great military helped us with barbed wire -- you would have people pouring in. They don't pour in. The problem is our laws are so bad that there's no way we can quickly remove them."
00:46:26 - 00:46:59 (33 sec),"Other countries say, ""Get out of here."" We have to bring them through a court system. We sign their names, they touch our land, we sign them up, we explained to them, ""Please come back in six years for court,"" and only the dumbest people show back up. Nobody ever shows up. Nobody comes back in, like 2 percent."
00:46:59 - 00:47:33 (34 sec),"They go in to our country. The good news is we have great law enforcement and many of these people, we know where they are, and we're going to get them the hell out. But we have to change our laws. So right now we have a backlog. You won't even believe this. Other countries don't do this. Somebody walks into our country, we bring them to court, we have now a legal -- we need Perry Mason -- [Audience laughs] -- we have a legal case."
00:47:33 - 00:48:07 (34 sec),"Nobody else does that. Other countries say, ""Get out. You can't come in. You're not a citizen of whatever country."" We bring them in. So listen to this, right now we have almost 900,000 cases, 900,000. How many judges are going to take care of -- we're going to have to hire tens of thousands of judges to do that, 900,000 cases."
00:48:07 - 00:48:58 (50 sec),"How stupid is this? This was a system put in place by really dumb people or people that did not have the best interests of our country at heart. And there's no place better to talk about border security, whether they like it or not, because I've been hearing a lot of things,"" Oh, the Wall didn't make that much of a difference."" You know where it made a big difference?"
00:48:58 - 00:49:34 (36 sec),"Right here in El Paso. And I've been watching where they've been trying to say, ""Oh, the Wall didn't make that much -- "" Well you take a look at what they did with their past crimes and how they made them from very serious to a much lesser, you take a look at what the real system is. I spoke to people that have been here a long time they said, ""When that wall went up, it's a whole different ball game."" Is that a correct statement?"
00:49:34 - 00:50:22 (48 sec),"A whole different ball game. I'll give you another example. And I don't care whether a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat, they're full of crap when they say it has it made a big difference. I heard the same thing from the fake news. They said, ""Oh, crime actually stayed the same."" It didn't say the same, it went way down and look at what they did to their past crimes and look at how they recorded those past crimes, it went way, way down."
00:50:22 - 00:50:42 (20 sec),"These people, you know, you'd think did want to get to the bottom of a problem and solve a problem, not try and pull the wool over everybody's eyes. So for those few people that are out there on television saying, ""Oh, it didn't make too much of a difference,"" it made a -- people from El Paso, am I right?"
00:50:42 - 00:51:31 (48 sec),"It's fake news. It's fake. I'm telling you, just fake news. And you know what? You wouldn't even have to know you can say that automatically without even knowing it. It's obvious, it's common sense. Just a few thousand feet, as an example, from where we stand right now on the other side of the border, it's one of the most dangerous cities in the world, Juarez, Mexico."
00:51:31 - 00:52:17 (46 sec),"Well, the people at Juarez agree. Yet, thanks to a powerful border wall and El Paso, Texas it's one of America's safest cities now. Now, listen to the this, so you're talking a few feet away, right, a few feet, got a wall, a few feet away. Last year Juarez had 1,200 murders, El Paso, right next door, a few feet away, had 23 murders."
00:52:17 - 00:52:51 (34 sec),"That's not good either. But 23 compared to 1,200. Walls work, actually there's nothing like them for what we're talking about. We want to stop drugs. We want to stop traffickers. We want to stop criminals from coming in, walls save lives. Walls save tremendous numbers of lives. The biggest proponents of open borders are rich liberals and wealthy donors."
00:52:51 - 00:53:14 (23 sec),"These are hypocrites who oppose security for you while living their entire lives -- I do it too, to be honest with you, I'm guilty. I'm guilty. I also live behind walls, okay. They live behind walls and gates in their guards all over the place. Me too, because I want to be safe and I want to make America safe, if you don't mind. [Audience chants USA]"
00:53:14 - 00:53:43 (29 sec),"So security should not belong only to the rich and to the powerful, safety is the birthright of every American, which is why we must finish the Wall. It's happening. Because walls are not immoral, as it was said, human trafficking is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Drug peddling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes]"
00:53:43 - 00:54:22 (40 sec),"Child smuggling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Sanctuary Cities that get Americans killed, they're immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Open borders are dangerous and immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] My administration has put forward a compromise that really is a compromise, and I hate even compromise on things like this, but it's showing common sense, it's compassionate, and it's going to solve our problem and the cost is a fraction."
00:54:22 - 00:55:27 (64 sec),"When you look at the drugs that are pouring across from Mexico, if it stopped a small percentage, and it won't, it'll stop a large percentage, it would pay for itself in a matter of weeks. That's the kind of numbers you're talking about, a matter of weeks. And by the way, I -- I hate to say this, because we have a very good relationship, but Mexico had the highest number of killings that they've ever had, almost 40,000 people were murdered in Mexico."
00:55:27 - 00:56:13 (46 sec),"Mexico is not too far away, and we need to take care of our people and we're going to do that and it's happening and it's happening a lot faster than anybody thought. And I love that sign. Thank you. What we're proposing includes humanitarian assistance, drug detection at our ports and everywhere else, closing legal loopholes, which is a big problem, and plans for a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier or wall, let's call it a wall, it's better."
00:56:13 - 00:56:52 (40 sec),"This wall will be built in the areas identified by border agents is having the greatest need while safely directing people and commerce to our many lawful ports of entry, which we're beefing up in every way, structurally, with beefing up the ports of entry and mechanically. We have equipment now that can spot drugs."
00:56:52 - 00:57:31 (38 sec),"It's incredible stuff. It's expensive. It's incredible. By the way, there is nothing better than a good old-fashioned German Shepherd. It's hard to believe, right. It's true you know, I -- I was with the people and they're showing me this incredible computerized stuff and where it goes. I said ""Could I -- ""Because Secret Service took me out to the place and they were showing me these German Shepherds, they're unbelievable."
00:57:31 - 00:58:04 (33 sec),"They'll run past all these empty boxes and one of the boxes has drugs in it, deep down in a box and they come to a screeching halt barking at it every time. So I asked the people that sell the machinery, at a lot of money, so I said, ""Let me ask you a question. This stuff is incredible. I'm really impressed."
00:58:04 - 00:58:47 (43 sec),"How does it compare to a German Shepherd?"" The guy looks at and says, ""Sir, honestly, it's not as good."" Can you believe it? A German Shepard. Certain types of dogs, pretty good. You do love your dogs, don't you? I wouldn't mind having one, honestly, but I don't have any time, I don't have -- How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn, would that be -- Right, sort of not for -- I don't know, it doesn't -- I don't feel good."
00:58:47 - 00:59:23 (35 sec),"It feels a little phony-phony to me. A lot of people say, ""Oh, you should get a dog."" ""Why?"" ""It's good politically."" I said, ""Look, that's not the relationship I have with my people. We want -- "" [Audience members yells something about Obama] Yeah, Obama had a dog, you're right. [Laughter] Both parties should come together to finally create a safe and lawful system of immigration."
00:59:23 - 01:00:13 (51 sec),"The American people have waited long enough. We must secure the border, pass Kate's Law -- end Catch and Release, shutdown Sanctuary Cities -- you know, we need Democrat votes to do that -- deport criminal aliens, and keep the coyotes and traffickers and drug dealers the hell out of our country, please. And the Democrats also need to confirm the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are sitting in the Senate waiting for confirmation, people that have given up their lives to work in the Trump administration and the Democrats aren't approving them."
01:00:13 - 01:00:35 (22 sec),"It's a record. [Audience Boos] It's total obstruction. It's a record of the history of our country there has never been -- Some people left the job a year and a half ago, two years ago, to become an ambassador or to work at one of our many great agencies and we can't get Schumer and his friends to approve them."
01:00:35 - 01:01:00 (25 sec),"It's total obstruction. There's never been anything like it. Very, very unfair, very unfair to these people. In many cases, seriously, they've left jobs and they're waiting and waiting and waiting, they're slow walking every single one of them. It's a disgrace. As we fight to protect our borders we must also protect our newfound prosperity."
01:01:00 - 01:01:42 (42 sec),"My administration has taken the toughest ever action to crack down on years of China's abuse and its trade practices have been very unfair. And I have a lot of respect for President Xi, but he's representing China and I'm representing the United States. We're also replacing one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever done, although I happen to think that the WTO is not so good either, we're replacing NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that everybody is loving."
01:01:42 - 01:02:01 (19 sec),"We've got to get Congress to approve it. We've got to get Congress to approve. We'll get it, I think done. I mean, there's such obstruction in Congress, you know, they won't even do things that are good for our country now. They would rather have Trump have a loss than get something that's so good for our country."
01:02:01 - 01:02:20 (19 sec),"Our farmers are happy, everybody's happy. And it's going to be jobs. You know, what it does? It stops companies from moving out. It makes it very hard economically for companies to say, ""Hey, thanks a lot. We're firing everybody, we're moving to Mexico."" Makes it very, very hard. You know, that's been a bone of contention for me for many years."
01:02:20 - 01:02:47 (27 sec),"I've seen 25 percent and more of our automobile business move to Mexico and it's not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. Unless they want to pay nice big fat tariffs to send their cars back into this country We've achieved, and by the way, tariffs had have had an incredible effect. Just ask the folks in China, ""How are we doing with tariffs?"" You ask."
01:02:47 - 01:03:23 (36 sec),"And you ask, ""How are we doing in our negotiations?"" The fact is, and I say it openly, either they treat us fairly or they have to pay for the privilege of coming in and taking our wealth and taking our jobs, it's very simple. It's very, very simple. And if you look back at our country when we were very rich, when we had no debt, when we had no problems economically, you take back -- you take a look, 1888, the Great Tariff Debate, you know the debate was about?"
01:03:23 - 01:03:45 (22 sec),"Our country had so much money they had to debate what the hell to do with all the money because tariffs were bringing in a fortune into the United States. So at a minimum, countries in negotiating with us very seriously because of the fact that they don't want to have to pay to come in and take advantage of our country, that's at a minimum."
01:03:45 - 01:04:23 (38 sec),"Check it out, 188. Have the press check it out. They'll say, ""Donald Trump said 1888."" [Audience Laughs] We've achieved the largest decline in drug prices in 46 years, prescription drugs. And I'm asking Congress to work with me to make prescription drugs affordable for every American family. We just got the largest decrease in drug prices, think of that, and it's not easy, it's not easy."
01:04:23 - 01:04:43 (20 sec),"Because we have middlemen that take care of a lot of people for a lot of years, these middlemen and the drug companies, but even worse, the middleman, and we're cutting the middleman out. they're not going to like be very much. They made a lot of money. But think of that, they're better the first time in 46 years."
01:04:43 - 01:05:15 (32 sec),"And now we're going to phase three, we did one statutorily, we did two statutorily, now we go to phase three, we're getting your drug prices down. We're embarking on bald initiatives to defeat AIDS. Who knew that? We have medicines now that work wonders on AIDS. We're looking to be AIDS-free in not many years as a country and maybe help, also, the world, the world."
01:05:15 - 01:05:48 (33 sec),"So we want to defeat AIDS and we want to feed childhood cancer. We've made tremendous strides. Tremendous strides. In the Middle East, are brave warriors have liberated virtually 100 percent of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Now, you don't hear that from these people. Now, we've taken back -- soon it'll be announced soon, maybe over the next week, maybe less, but it'll be announced very soon -- we'll have 100 percent."
01:05:48 - 01:06:07 (18 sec),"When I took over this country, it was a mess. And if I wouldn't have been elected -- You know, I have so many people, I was just walking up and every time it happens, ""Sir, thank you. Thank you very much."" This guy, he's -- he's like a monster. No, no, it's true. These people. This guy is like a monster."
01:06:07 - 01:06:28 (21 sec),"He's like this monster football -- a big, strong guy. He says to me, he said, ""Thank you very much."" I don't know what they're saying, but that's okay. Now he's this big, strong guy and he's crying. And he said, ""Mr. -- "" I'm walking up and it happens all the time. ""Thank you very much, Mr. President."" I said, ""For what?"" He said, ""You've saved our country."
01:06:28 - 01:06:54 (26 sec),"Our country was going in the wrong direction. You've saved our country. Thank you."" I've had so many people say that. So many people. You know what the truth is though? I didn't save our country, we're now heading in the right direction. It's very tough because we have so many things were fighting, including these people."
01:06:54 - 01:07:17 (23 sec),"But so many people that we're finding, so many people that are either foolish or ill-intentioned. But you know, I didn't save our county, you know saved our country, you saved our country. You saved our country, and God. Because there's never -- nothing like this has ever happened before. And you know what?"
01:07:17 - 01:07:48 (30 sec),"The world is watching and when prime ministers, and when presidents, and kings and queens, they talked to me they say, ""Congratulations on what's happened with your economy, Mr. President, it's incredible."" They're emulating what we're doing. They can't believe it. So we continue to decimate the remnants, because they're always going to be remnants, we can take the area the land, we'll soon have 100 percent, but they're always remnants, they get out, they wrap themselves in bombs."
01:07:48 - 01:08:30 (42 sec),"They're crazy. They're lunatics. But you're always going to have that. But we want to bring, now -- we've got 100 percent. It was so bad when I took over, it was going the opposite direction. Syria, we want to bring our troops back home. It's time. It's time. It's time. And thanks to the extraordinary service of our military in Afghanistan, 19 years we're in Afghanistan, we may now be able to seek a political resolution that, frankly, they've wanted to talk about for a long time."
01:08:30 - 01:08:55 (26 sec),"We've hit them very hard, but it's been 19 years. Think of that, 19 years. We spend more on military in Afghanistan, $50 billion a year, than most countries spend on their entire country, healthcare, education, everything. We spend more than they do. It's time to start thinking smart for our country. What we want to build our country."
01:08:55 - 01:09:33 (38 sec),"We want to spend money in our country. We want to build our roads, and highways, and bridges, and dams. And last month the United States recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and condemned the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. [Audience Boos] Everywhere socialism has been, everywhere it's been implemented, it's produced poverty, misery, repression, and despair."
01:09:33 - 01:10:35 (61 sec),"You take a look no matter where. Yet, there are those trying to implement socialism right here in the United States. So I, again, say to you -- [Audience Boos] -- and I say it for the world to hear, America will never be a Socialist country, never, never. [Audience chants USA] We're born free. We will live free and we will die free."
01:10:35 - 01:11:20 (46 sec),"We will always be free. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and our great rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American way."
01:11:20 - 01:11:41 (21 sec),"We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our incredible history, and always respect our great American flag. We believe that the first duty of government is to be loyal to its citizens."
01:11:41 - 01:12:18 (37 sec),"And we live by the words of our national motto that we are going to keep -- we'll never change this -- In God We Trust. These are the beliefs, traditions, and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as great patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the great State of Texas."
01:12:18 - 01:13:07 (49 sec),"From Houston to Austin, from Dallas to El Paso -- from the Red River to the Rio Grande, the Lone Star State embodies the spirit of independence like maybe no other place anywhere in the world. And you have always embraced the cause of American Freedom like no one else. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo."
01:13:07 - 01:13:46 (38 sec),"This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzalez, armed with a single cannon, stared down a foreign, powerful army and declared, ""Come and take it."" Come on, come on, take it. Texas is the state where generations of farmers, ranchers, oil workers, and pioneers help build up the most extraordinary nation in all of human history."
01:13:46 - 01:14:18 (32 sec),"That's what we are. We were losing track, we didn't lose track getting more, we're just great on that track. Now, just like generations of Texas patriots who came before, you are going to make your stand. That's what we've done, we've made our stand and we've made it together. This is a big group of millions and millions of people that have come together like never before in our history."
01:14:18 - 01:15:31 (73 sec),"This has never happened before. And we've come for safety, for sovereignty, and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America. And together, with the proud and incredible and great people of the State of Texas, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:01:07 (67 sec),"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much, Grand Rapids. It's great to be back. Right here in America's heartland. You know that, right? With the hard-working patriots from the great state of Michigan. By the way we are bringing a lot of those car companies back. Remember I told you they are coming back?"
00:01:07 - 00:01:47 (40 sec),They are pouring back in. They are coming back. They are coming back fast. This has been an incredible couple of weeks for America. The economy is roaring. The ISIS caliphate is defeated 100 percent. And after three years of lies and smears and slander the Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over.
00:01:47 - 00:02:43 (56 sec),"The Special Counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction. I could have told you that two and a half years ago very easily. Total exoneration. Complete vindication. You know, it's interesting Robert Mueller was a God to the Democrats, was a God to them until he said there was no collusion."
00:02:43 - 00:03:52 (69 sec),"They don't like him so much right now. The crazy attempt by the Democrat party and the fake news media right back there -- And the deep state to overturn the results of the 2016 election have failed, the greatest election that we've had in a long time may be right from the beginning. [Audience Chants Trump] This was nothing more than a sinister effort to undermine our historic election victory and to sabotage the will of the American people."
00:03:52 - 00:04:41 (49 sec),"This is the one we want. We want ourselves. We want us and that's what we got. We came from all over to vote. They've never taken it away from us, never. Never. Our movement took on the political establishment, the corrupt media and it's never been more corrupt than it is today. And many special interests, that's why they tried to do everything possible to take us out but we are very tough to take out aren't we? Very, very, very."
00:04:41 - 00:05:43 (61 sec),"The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and eat illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans, many of them. They suffered with an elaborate hoax. They wanted to destroy a movement like our country has never seen before. That's true. Never seen before. And believe me, if these people thought that that wasn't true, they would be writing it. They've never seen anything like it. Nobody has in this country's history and in most countries histories there has never been anything like what we did in 2016 on November 8. We defeated a very corrupt establishment and we kept our promise to the American people and it's driving them crazy."
00:05:43 - 00:06:08 (25 sec),"Today our movement and our country are thriving. Their fraud has been exposed and the credibility of those who pushed this hoax is forever broken and they've now got big problems. And the harm done to our country -- think of what they've done. Think of the time wasted and yet despite this terrible cloud, this phony, corrupt, disgusting cloud we have done more together in the first two years than any administration in the history of our country."
00:06:08 - 00:06:39 (31 sec),"And this group of major losers did not just ruthlessly attack me, my family, and everyone who questioned their lies, they tried to divide our country, to poison the national debate, and to tear up the fabric of our great democracy, the greatest anywhere in the world. They did it all because they refuse to accept the results of one of the greatest Presidential elections, probably number one in our history."
00:06:39 - 00:07:14 (35 sec),"Many, many people were badly hurt by this scam. But more importantly our country was hurt. Our country was hurt and they're on artificial respirators right now. [Laughter] They are getting mouth to mouth resuscitation. Little pencil-neck Adam Schiff. He's got the smallest, thinnest neck I've ever seen. [Laughter] He is not a long ball hitter but I saw him today well, we don't really know."
00:07:14 - 00:07:32 (18 sec),"There could still have been some Russia collusion. Sick. Sick. These are sick people and there has to be accountability because it's all lies and they know it's lies. They know it. They know it. Jerry Nadler, I've been fighting him for many years. He was the Congressman from Manhattan. I built great things in Manhattan."
00:07:32 - 00:08:16 (44 sec),"I had to beat him many, many times. Now I come here, I have to beat him again. Can you believe? I want every record in the history of the Trump organization. Every single sheet of paper. And what do you have to justify? Nothing. It doesn't matter. We will find something somewhere along the line. A mistake must have been made."
00:08:16 - 00:08:56 (40 sec),"These people are sick. Sick. Every single deal. Every single paper. All of the Democrat politicians, the media bosses bad people. The crooked journalist, the totally dishonest TV pundits and by the way they know it's not true. They just got great readings. By the way their ratings dropped through the floor last night."
00:08:56 - 00:09:35 (39 sec),"Did you see that? And our friends Tucker, Sean, Laura through the roof last night. And all of the current and former officials who paid for, promoted, and perpetuated the single greatest hoax in the history of politics in our country they have to be -- I'm sorry. They have to be accountable. Just think of. A fake, dirty dossier millions and millions of dollars paid for it. By who?"
00:09:35 - 00:10:28 (53 sec),"Crooked Hillary Clinton, the DNC and the Democrat party. Think of it. This is what they used. But they failed. They failed in one way. Can you believe it? Maybe I got lucky. Maybe I got lucky because the fake news they wouldn't put it on. Even they didn't be leave it. Think of it, they spent millions of dollars and the deal was they get it published or printed all of these horrible lies, all now totally exposed as fake."
00:10:28 - 00:11:02 (33 sec),They were going to get it printed just before the election and they couldn't get any of the media to print it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. You never know. You never know. You lose a few vote and that could be the difference but they wouldn't print it so I will tell you on that score I give the media a lot of credit.
00:11:02 - 00:11:33 (31 sec),"It came out after the election and everybody had a big, fat yawn. [Laughter] And I heard about Russia. I'd be running, I'd be hearing -- they'd say something about Russia. I'd say Russia, what does that have to do -- ? This went on. Little -- and then all of the sudden I hear were you involved with Russia?"
00:11:33 - 00:12:08 (35 sec),"I say Russia? What the hell does Russia have to do with my campaign? It's true. Russia. Russia. You know I go up to Wisconsin where she didn't go, she was told you know many, many years, decades, since a Republican one although Bill Clinton said he was in Wisconsin and you'd better get up there, there are a lot of signs up saying Trump Pence, a lot of signs."
00:12:08 - 00:12:28 (20 sec),"A lot of those signs. You'd better get up there darling. And they said no, no, no. Don't worry about Wisconsin because you know Wisconsin the pollsters say we're doing great. They don't come to a place called Michigan. Have you ever heard of Michigan? Michigan. And Bill Clinton said you know I was in Michigan, you'd better get to Michigan."
00:12:28 - 00:13:23 (55 sec),"It's not looking good. They have so many of those damn signs. Every place I look they have the sign on somebody's lawn. You'd better get up to -- know, Michigan hasn't been lost in decades by the Dems. By the Dems. Hasn't been lost. And if you remember this was my last stop. This was it. And I'll never forget this was a spur of the moment because I heard crooked Hillary and Bill, Barack Obama and Michelle -- they were all headed here, right, at the last moment."
00:13:23 - 00:14:04 (41 sec),"They had a tiny, little crowd and I had I'd like to say more but I can't have more than this because every seat is gone and outside you have 25,000 people. And I remember leaving and I said so she's got 500 people and I had 32,000 people including the people outside. I will tell you we have more tonight because outside we have even more than we did then."
00:14:04 - 00:14:32 (28 sec),"And I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning so it's now election day. In fact I actually said am I allowed to do this? It's 1 o'clock in the morning. I had made six speeches and when I heard she was coming I said you know what, what the hell. [Laughter] So it was spur of the moment, last second. We called and we had 32,000 people including all of the people outside."
00:14:32 - 00:15:07 (35 sec),"She had [Inaudible]. I said so let me explain. Let me ask. So she's here at prime time 730, I'm here at one in the morning. She has 500 or 600 people, I have 32,000. Can you explain why am I going to lose Michigan? Why? Why am I going to lose Michigan? Why am I going to lose the great state? I was asking my people."
00:15:07 - 00:15:45 (38 sec),"I get home at 4 o'clock in the morning and I told our great First Lady, soon to be first lady -- and she's doing a great job. They love her. I said you know I have this incredible crowd and I didn't start speaking until 1 o'clock in the morning. I said how the hell could I lose Michigan and guess what we didn't lose Michigan."
00:15:45 - 00:16:32 (47 sec),"And you know what, we didn't lose Wisconsin either. And the fact is we won a lot of places that night. We won Pennsylvania. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won Florida. We ran the East Coast. We won Iowa, you'd better believe Iowa. We love Iowa. We won. We won a lot. We won a lot. Well, we 306 to 223. Would you say that's good?"
00:16:32 - 00:17:11 (39 sec),"I say that's good. Because of here. Remember they said there is no way -- . The day of the election I'm saying you know this is pretty lousy. It's all fake news. You know they are trying to put it in your head. They go there is no way to 270. In other words I needed 270 to win. There is no way for Donald Trump, I wasn't President."
00:17:11 - 00:17:53 (42 sec),"Then, I was a little short of President There is no way on CNN for Donald Trump, remember the red board? It was so red; the red was killing -- they were dying. There is no way for 270 for Donald Trump. It will be a very short evening for Donald Trump there just is no way and they were right. We didn't get 270. We got 306. But in this country -- [Audience chants Four more years] But in this country, we cannot criminalize political differences, political differences."
00:17:53 - 00:18:20 (27 sec),We do not abuse the law enforcement and intelligence power to target our political opponents when they spy on me. Whoever heard of this? They spied on me. They spied on our campaign. Who would think that's possible? The single greatest political hoax in the history of our country and guess what? We won. It's a beautiful thing.
00:18:20 - 00:18:45 (25 sec),"It's a beautiful thing. We love to win. They tried to take something great away from people that came from all over. I always say, they came from the valleys, they came from the mountains, they came out of the damn rivers. I don't know what you were doing in the river but they came from the cities. They came and they came and they didn't even know these people existed."
00:18:45 - 00:19:08 (23 sec),"They are hard-working. They are successful, they are the smartest people, they are the toughest people, they are the most loyal people. They are. They are the smartest. Remember this about yourself. You know I always hear the easily, the release. Well, I always said they said it. I said it here my last night."
00:19:08 - 00:19:42 (34 sec),"I always say they say the easily. They are the elite, I am not. Well, I have a better education than them, I'm smarter than them. I went to the best schools, they didn't. Much more beautiful house, much more beautiful apartment, much more beautiful everything. And I'm President and they are not, right? And then they say the elite, the elite."
00:19:42 - 00:20:07 (25 sec),"They are not elite, you are the elite. We are the elite. I get a kick. I hear so and so the elite. Then you see this guy, like this little schlepper, this is elite? I'm not elite. This is elite. We are the elite. You are smarter. You are sharper. You are more loyal. You are a hell of a lot tougher. A hell of a lot tougher."
00:20:07 - 00:20:29 (22 sec),"So we can't have two different standards of justice in our country. One where the left wing radical establishment can get away with anything they want. But you know, I have to tell you. I said it last night, we have some great, great friends in the media too. You look at Rush and Sean -- And Laura and Steve and Ainsley and Tucker and Jeanine."
00:20:29 - 00:21:19 (50 sec),"Jeanine is back, going to be back on Saturday night. Jeanine, right? And even Greg likes me now. Greg. He started a little slow but he likes Trump. But we have a lot of great support. We really do. We have a lot of great support. Far more than you think but where we really have the support are the voters that pull that handle or whatever the hell they are pulling they are pulling it for us. So the Russia hoax proves more than ever that we need to finish exactly what we came here to do. Drain the swamp."
00:21:19 - 00:21:47 (28 sec),"The Democrats have to now decide whether they will continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bullshit -- Partisan investigations or whether they will apologize to the American people and join us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, bring down the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs which we are doing incredibly, help us fix our broken trade deals which are coming along really well."
00:21:47 - 00:22:14 (27 sec),"We have our team right now in China. They just arrived. China. China. We've gone up, they've gone down but we want them to be healthy. We want them to be happy and healthy. China. And by the way we are building the wall as us -- , we are building that wall. Building -- We are building that wall. [Audience chants build that wall] We had to go down a little bit of a different path but that's okay."
00:22:14 - 00:22:46 (33 sec),"National emergency it is. And if you look at the border and you look at the hundreds of thousands of people that are invading or at least trying to invade our country you would know that we needed and we are building it. And we are building it a lot faster than anybody would -- and better, and better. It's better."
00:22:46 - 00:23:34 (47 sec),"It's faster and it's less expensive. And it's also much more beautiful. And we are building it very rapidly. It's moving along and we renovated vast amounts of wall. A lot of it was in bad shape, we renovated it for 25 cents on the dollar. That's okay, too, right? That's good too. The fake news doesn't want to give us any credit for renovation."
00:23:34 - 00:24:09 (35 sec),"They say even if you rip it down and build a brand-new wall where the wall was, they call that a renovation. That's not a renovation for me. That's not. They do anything they can to -- you're right. Shifty Schiff. They do whatever they can do sort of make it look not so good. We are really doing well but we have a problem."
00:24:09 - 00:25:09 (60 sec),"Our country has never been better economically and people are trying to get in and they have to come in legally and they have to come in based on merit. Based on merit. Despite all that we have been forced to endure every day we are working and fighting and winning. Remember that because we are making America great again and we are making a great for all Americans, all Americans."
00:25:09 - 00:25:35 (26 sec),"And it's getting to be that time, very important. MAGA country. You heard the other day. How about in Chicago? He said -- He said he was attacked by MAGA country. Did you ever hear that one? I don't know -- . May be the only time I've ever agreed with the Mayor of Chicago. That's a terrible situation. That's an embarrassment not only to Chicago."
00:25:35 - 00:26:03 (28 sec),That is an embarrassment to our country what took place there. Remember that. But they are looking at it. So we are delighted to be joined this evening by some really incredible people. People that love you. Members of Congress. Bill Huizenga. Where is Bill? Bill Huizenga. Where is he? Where the hell is he? You didn't get a very good location.
00:26:03 - 00:26:35 (32 sec),"[Laughter] You didn't get a good bill. You did not get a great location but we have some news. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. And Jack Bergman. Thank you, Jack. So here's something good. You ready? In honor of those guys and some of your other representatives and all that we think are fantastic we have some breaking news."
00:26:35 - 00:27:18 (43 sec),"You ready? I don't know. Can you handle it? I don't think you can handle it. I support the Great Lakes. Always have. They are beautiful. They are big, very deep, record deepness, right? And I'm going to get in honor of my friends full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative -- Which you have been trying to get for over 30 years."
00:27:18 - 00:28:02 (44 sec),"So we will get it done. It's time. It's time. It's time. You been trying to get it over 30 years. I would say it's time. Right? Also and as you know this one, we have already pretty much locked up, I'll say locked up. You all understand that because we are very close to getting started on the beautiful new Soo Locks that people have wanted to build for a very, very long time."
00:28:02 - 00:28:39 (37 sec),So we are very close to finishing that one off. And by the way don't let your new Democrat Governor -- or don't let -- Don't let any of our people that find us all of the way now that we have it take credit for it. Okay? Don't let it. Don't let it. You are too smart for that. We are also joined this evening by the Speaker of the Michigan House Lee Chatfield.
00:28:39 - 00:29:22 (43 sec),"Thank you, leave. Thanks, Lee. A person who is doing a fantastic job GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox. And a woman you know very well, she headed up Michigan. They said she was wasting her time, Trump is never going to win Michigan. I said but I'm going to bring back your auto business. Remember? And I did, and I did."
00:29:22 - 00:30:20 (58 sec),"And when we won, I said who is that woman? I want to see her and we put her in charge of the RNC, Republican National Committee. Ronna McDaniel. Ronna. And a friend of mine, he used show but he's very rich he shouldn't be shy. He's one of the biggest builders and real estate people in the world, one of the biggest owners of property."
00:30:20 - 00:30:47 (27 sec),"I shouldn't introduce them because you guys will like him because he's a big owner of property but you own -- you own property, he just owns more of it than you do. [Laughter] And he's a great guy and he's been with me from the beginning, Stanley Chera. Stanley. Those big beautiful buildings in Manhattan."
00:30:47 - 00:31:11 (25 sec),"You know those big beautiful buildings? He owns it. Stanley, how much did you make this month? [Laughter] Stanley is a great guy. Been with us all. He loves you and he's been with us from the beginning and we've had a lot of people with us. We've had people you wouldn't believe we've had a lot of support."
00:31:11 - 00:31:36 (24 sec),"In the last two years we've embarked on an unprecedented economic revival. Unprecedented. America is now the hottest economy anywhere on the planet Earth. There's nobody close. Since our election when the stock market is up almost 50 percent. You are looking like geniuses with your 401(k)s, right? Your wife or your husband is saying darling, you're such a great investor."
00:31:36 - 00:32:15 (39 sec),"How are we doing? We are up 67 percent. Oh, darling, you're so brilliant. [Laughter] In your whole life you've been criticized by her or him but all of the sudden they think you are the single greatest investor. Thank you, Donald. [Laughter] By the way if you want to see those 401(k)s and all of your stocks and all of the things that you own, you want to see them deflate put a good socialist in this position."
00:32:15 - 00:32:55 (39 sec),"Go get yourself a good socialist. You'll see some deflation. You'll see a nice deflate of your stocks and your bonds and your 401(k). We have created since my election 5.5 million new jobs. Nobody would have believed that was possible. Including 600,000 brand-new -- remember, this couldn't happen. You need a magic wand."
00:32:55 - 00:33:22 (28 sec),"Brand-new manufacturing jobs. Well, how did that happen? We were going to have any new man -- it was going down 600,000 and it's going to be increasing by a lot because you have a lot of companies pouring into Michigan and your other great states. A lot. More manufacturing jobs in fact were created in 2018 than in the year in more than 21 years."
00:33:22 - 00:33:58 (35 sec),"That's not bad. That's not bad. And that's not even one of our better statistics. That's actually like at the bottom of the pack. Do you believe me? After years of stagnation wages are rising fast. Do you remember I use to say that people made more money 21 years ago? All of the time and they had one job then they did -- this is two, three years ago, right, than they did working two and three jobs now."
00:33:58 - 00:34:32 (34 sec),"True. But now wages are rising. You have your choice of jobs like I got choice for the veterans, we also got choice for people wanting jobs. So wages are rising substantially for those people. You are doing great but they are also rising most quickly for the lowest income Americans. First time in decades."
00:34:32 - 00:35:07 (35 sec),"And here's a statistic that I love because blue-collar jobs recently grew at the fastest pace in more than 30 years. Whoever thought, right? 30 years. And unemployment has reached the lowest rate in 51 years and soon it will be in the history of our country. 51 years. And to me very important, you remember I use to say what do you have to lose?"
00:35:07 - 00:35:47 (40 sec),"What do you have to lose, right? And I got criticized. You shouldn't say that. I said well, it's true. It's unfair. So importantly to me African-American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment and unemployment among disabled Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:35:47 - 00:36:29 (42 sec),And you remember in the last election they said Donald Trump will not do well with women. I said really? I said really? No. All of the fake news they said you will not do well with women and maybe they didn't want to say they like me to be honest. That I can understand. And then the election came and they said whatever happened to the fact that he wasn't going to do well with women because we did really well with women.
00:36:29 - 00:36:59 (30 sec),"Right? Right? Remember when I was sitting back a couple of them were trying, remember one of the true killers she was crying not from happiness. But we did great with women. We did great with women and I think we are going to do better with women now because you know what? I produced. Because women filled more than 60 percent of all new jobs created last year."
00:36:59 - 00:37:44 (45 sec),"60 percent. Think about. 60 percent. So that means the men better get moving, folks. You are falling behind. The women are -- they are beating you pretty good men. Get going. The women got 60 percent of all of the new jobs. I mean that's an incredible number. We've cut the greatest number of regulations in two years in the history of our country."
00:37:44 - 00:38:20 (37 sec),"Not for two years, in the history of our country. That's one of the things helping us with the jobs. And the United States people don't even believe this, it all happened very recently is now the number one oil and gas producer in the world. Number one. Number one. And by the way Russia is not happy about that but they are fine."
00:38:20 - 00:38:50 (30 sec),"They are doing just fine but they are not happy about that. If Hillary got in you wouldn't have that stat, I can tell you right now. You would be doing wind, windmills and if it doesn't -- if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night. [Laughter] Darling, I want to watch television. I'm sorry, the wind isn't blowing."
00:38:50 - 00:39:39 (49 sec),"I know a lot about wind. I know a lot about wind. We passed massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country. And very importantly for those people with small farms and businesses we got rid of the death tax or the estate tax. So now when you leave your farm or small business to your children under the assumption that you like your children, some people don't. Some people say I wouldn't leave it to them under any circumstances."
00:39:39 - 00:40:15 (36 sec),"I can't stand my kids but for those of you that do which I assume is hopefully a vast majority you don't have an estate tax to pay, they don't. So they can take over your farm, they can take over your business, they don't have to mortgage it to the hilt and then the bank comes in five years later takes it away from your kids."
00:40:15 - 00:40:59 (44 sec),"No tax. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate penalty. The most unpopular part and we are going to hopefully in the court -- in Texas you heard we won the case, now it has to be appealed and then we will go to the United States Supreme Court. We have a chance of killing Obamacare. We almost did it but somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down but we will do it a different way."
00:40:59 - 00:41:32 (33 sec),"You know what, we will do it a different way but we got rid of the individual mandate where you were forced to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to buy bad healthcare. Okay? Not too good. So we are going to get rid of Obamacare. And I said it the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great healthcare."
00:41:32 - 00:41:58 (26 sec),It's good. It's important. And we have created new options to help Americans purchase affordable health plans all across state lines. You now have options you would have never had. The Democrats are pushing socialist government-run healthcare that bans private healthcare for 180 million Americans. Now think of it. A lot of you have private plans and they are great.
00:41:58 - 00:42:28 (31 sec),"They are great and you want that. They want to take them away. That's not going to work. I don't think that's going to work too well. Republicans want you to have an affordable plan that's just right for you and by the way you can use your doctor, remember that? That was a lie. 28 times, 28 times he said that was a lie."
00:42:28 - 00:43:04 (36 sec),"You get cheaper premiums in much lower deductibles. The deductibles and Obamacare are so high on average $7000. You don't get to use it unless a really great tragedy hits and then you don't really want it because you don't give a damn about your deductible, right? You will be in a position where you say who cares about the deductible."
00:43:04 - 00:43:32 (28 sec),"Let's see if I can live. We believe that no one in America should be bankrupted by health care cost and that's what's happening with Obamacare. And remember this because it's very important and I'm speaking now for the Republican party, we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always."
00:43:32 - 00:44:05 (33 sec),Always. My administration has also begun the bold initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and in 2018 drug prices saw their first decline in 46 years. First time. First time. And they will be coming down a lot but this is the first time in 46 years that prescription drugs came down. Even Stanley likes that because he needs plenty of them.
00:44:05 - 00:44:39 (34 sec),"And then we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our amazing veterans. Our amazing veterans. They have been trying to get VA Choice for over 40 years. They couldn't do it. I got it. We signed it six months ago. Now instead of waiting online for one day, one week, two months people that were okay but not feeling well, wait so long that they become terminally ill."
00:44:39 - 00:45:16 (37 sec),"There was no reason for it. Now they go outside, they see a private doctor, we pay the bill, they get better quickly. And for 46 years VA Accountability you couldn't fire anybody in the VA. We had sadists. They took advantage in so many ways of our great veterans. They were rough, they wouldn't have hit them in prime time by the way, not in prime time."
00:45:16 - 00:46:03 (47 sec),"In prime time they would say okay, I don't want to touch you. I'm not going to play. They took advantage of people that are our great heroes that protected us and you couldn't fire them. They stole, they robbed. You couldn't fire them. It didn't matter what you did you couldn't fire them. Called accountability."
00:46:03 - 00:46:40 (37 sec),"We passed seven months ago today we passed VA Accountability. You heard our vets, you stole from us. Guess what, Bill? You're fired. You're fired. Get out. You're fired. And to give former prisoners a second chance I proudly signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. They have been trying to do that for so many years."
00:46:40 - 00:47:12 (33 sec),"So many years. Very unfair. And by the way some of the people that most supported it are the most conservative people you've ever seen. Both, both sides. Very bipartisan believe it or not for a change. But while we are pushing and pursuing all of these commonsense policies to advance the common good for our citizens Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism, resistance."
00:47:12 - 00:47:47 (34 sec),"Resist. Resist and revenge. Revenge. What do you think of their signs resist? What the hell? Let's get something done, right? Resist. Resist. Resist. Isn't that weird? You know you are looking to have a parade that's called resist. You say what the hell does that mean? No, no. We want to do legislation. There are so many things we can be doing together."
00:47:47 - 00:48:20 (33 sec),The Democrats are now advancing an extreme $100 trillion government takeover called the Green New Deal. But I'd rather not talk about it tonight because I don't want to talk them out of it too soon. [Laughter] Because I love campaigning against the Green New Deal. I want them to make they do a big part of their platform.
00:48:20 - 00:48:53 (33 sec),"No more airplanes, no more cows. One car per family. One car. You're going to love that in Michigan. Hey, how do you like the idea of one car per family? You know, I don't think one car per family in Michigan plays too well. Do you agree? Right? Not too well. And it's got to be of course an electric car even if it only goes what, 160 miles?"
00:48:53 - 00:49:27 (34 sec),"What do you do, it's 160 miles? Darling, where do I get a charge? Where do I get a charge, darling? No. We want to have a lot of cars per family. We want people to lead a great life and we want people to make those cars and we want all of these companies to keep coming to Michigan and all of the other great states and building those [Inaudible]. And we had a problem because when they didn't want the airplanes they were saying well, how do you get to Europe?"
00:49:27 - 00:49:57 (29 sec),"Nobody knew. How do you get to Australia? Nobody knew but they are working on it and then they were interviewing this woman from Hawaii, the Senator. The one that was so vicious about Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. Remember? By the way, do we love Justice Gorsuch and do we love Justice Kavanaugh?"
00:49:57 - 00:50:25 (29 sec),"She was so vicious to both and these are great people. She was vicious and they hit her. She didn't know about the Green New Deal and they hit her and she's from Hawaii. What do you think of the Green New Deal? It was just put up by the Democrats. Well, I like it very much but she never saw it. Then they said but you can't fly anymore and she's in Hawaii."
00:50:25 - 00:50:51 (25 sec),"She said but how would I get to my island? They said we are working on some kind of a train system. [Laughter] So she said okay, well then, I am for it 100 percent. It is the craziest thing I have ever seen. They want to rip down all of the buildings in Manhattan and rebuild them. Let's do that. Hey, Stanley, how do you like that idea?"
00:50:51 - 00:51:16 (25 sec),"I don't think so. I don't think Stanley likes that idea too much. It's the craziest thing but you know what, let's let them -- . It's like I attack so violently Pocahontas and -- And I knocked her out of the race I guess and I said what did I do that for? It's too early. I've got to start in about nine months from now."
00:51:16 - 00:51:42 (27 sec),"We've got plenty more to knock out, you're right. They just keep coming, don't they? They just keep coming. Before I took the oath of office the United States automobile industry was decimated and it was going down and you people knew it better than anybody else. We lost one in four auto manufacturing jobs over the last few decades."
00:51:42 - 00:52:21 (39 sec),"Think of it, one in four and I think the numbers were worse than that and so do you. But from the moment I entered the White House my first meeting was a meeting with car executives. I said what do I have to do to get your business going? We talked about CAFE standards where they were choking the engines, just choking them and costing a lot more for the cars and we had a great meeting and we worked on it and worked on it. We took historic and dramatic action to save the American auto industry and to defend American auto workers right here in Michigan."
00:52:21 - 00:52:55 (34 sec),"Right. And just in the last very short period of time we have added another 6000 vehicle manufacturing and auto parts jobs in Michigan alone and prevented thousands more from being shipped overseas and from going to Mexico. They can't do that anymore. Can't do that. Can't do that anymore. Sorry, Mexico."
00:52:55 - 00:53:22 (26 sec),"We want them to give us a little more help on the border by the way. You know Mexico has the toughest immigration laws in the world. We have the worst because the Democrats put in things that are so bad, so bad. Catch and release. You catch them and then you got to release them. Think of it. Visa lottery."
00:53:22 - 00:54:08 (46 sec),"You are in a lottery system from these countries. You pick up a name. Isn't that nice? Guess what? Do you think they are giving us their best people? No, they are not. They are giving us their worst people and so would you and so would I. Visa lottery. That's another beauty. We have nothing but bad coming out of those laws but you know the good thing about what's happening, the rush to the border, another two caravans now are pouring up. Mexico could stop them so easy and you know what?"
00:54:08 - 00:54:49 (41 sec),If they don't it's going to cost them a hell of a lot of money honestly because they could do it so easy. So easy. And if they don't and I'm telling you right now we will close the damn border. [Audience chants USA] And I don't know if you know it or not Michigan but Mexico took about 30 percent of your car business.
00:54:49 - 00:55:09 (20 sec),Not when I was here. When I'm here they are not. It's going the other way. 30 percent and if we close the border that means we are not taking those cars into our country and what does that mean? That means you are going to make more cars right here in the good old USA. That's what it means. Right? Very simple.
00:55:09 - 00:55:37 (28 sec),"It's all very simple. People try and make it too complicated. It's all very simple. One of the gravest threats to the survival of the U.S. auto industry was the job-killing, sovereignty-wrecking Trans-Pacific Partnership. It was going to decimate your industry. That's why one of my very first acts in office was to withdraw our country from that horrible potentially disastrous trade deal."
00:55:37 - 00:56:06 (28 sec),"And stop the offshoring of Michigan jobs. Saved a lot of jobs. That was a disaster. That would have been almost as bad as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world. NAFTA. That was a beauty. Your empty factories are still all over the place. They still haven't recovered from NAFTA. Well, NAFTA is going to be a thing of the past."
00:56:06 - 00:56:35 (29 sec),"Soon. Or we will just go to pre-NAFTA, that was okay, too. We had a huge surplus with Mexico, then we did NAFTA. We lost over the last six, seven years with Mexico $100 billion. Before NAFTA, we made $40-$50 billion. Doesn't sound like too good a deal, right? So we have now the USMCA and it's very good."
00:56:35 - 00:56:57 (22 sec),"If the Democrats want to raise their hand -- it's a hard thing for them to give us a victory but let's see if they raise their hands otherwise, we go to pre-NAFTA. We don't go to NAFTA, we go to pre-NAFTA. That was just okay with me. That was okay with me. A short time later I traveled to Detroit to cancel burdensome regulations that unfairly harm the motor city."
00:56:57 - 00:57:22 (26 sec),It was getting decimated. We renegotiated the U.S. Korea trade agreement to double the American auto exports to Korea. We doubled them. They were not happy about it. And to stop the cheap foreign pickup trucks from flooding our market. That's your best market. Do you know why? Because we have a chicken tax.
00:57:22 - 00:57:52 (30 sec),"We have a tariff, 25 percent and that's why it's your best market because they can't come in here and take away your business and take away your jobs. They weren't thrilled but that's okay. Under my administration we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American. And we are already seeing good results."
00:57:52 - 00:58:31 (39 sec),"Since the election we have created more than 55,000 brand-new motor vehicle and auto parts jobs in our country. 55,000. Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion investment in Michigan including the first new auto plant in Detroit in over a generation. And they are going to be investing in our country $13.5 billion over a very short period of time."
00:58:31 - 00:59:09 (38 sec),"And Ford has just announced a $1 billion investment just outside of Chicago as well as additional $900 million going right here in Michigan. And I've been a little bit disappointed with them because everyone else is coming in but General Motors did just announce a $300 million investment at its Orion assembly plant here in Michigan, right now."
00:59:09 - 00:59:47 (38 sec),"But I'm also fighting with General Motors and the UAW to take swift action on the GM plants at Hamtramck and Warren, Michigan and Lordstown, Ohio. Get the damn plants open. Everyone else is coming in. Get them open now. Right? So with companies like Chrysler and Ford and Toyota and Volkswagen all investing heavily in America and heavily in the state of Michigan we think General Motors will soon be doing the same."
00:59:47 - 01:00:19 (32 sec),"I really do believe it. You know they went before my time they went to China, they spent a lot of money building stuff. They went to Mexico. They spent a lot of money building stuff. That's not helping us much. So we think they are going to come around. As we protect our jobs, we are also protecting America's borders and we are taking on the extremist and they are really radical, radical extremist Democrats who want open borders in crime because that's what happens."
01:00:19 - 01:00:43 (24 sec),"Open borders and crime. Last month alone more than 76,000 illegal immigrants arrived at our borders to be apprehended. We have to apprehend them. Do you know what a great job -- I mean seriously think of that, 76,000 people many of which are rough people. Okay, I'm being nice because they will criticize me if I'm not."
01:00:43 - 01:01:14 (31 sec),"They will say how dare he say that. But we have people that have criminal records. We have a lot of people. We have a lot of problems. We apprehend them. We capture them. Do you know how tough that job is, border patrol? You know how tough? I don't think any of you guys here -- yeah, you would. That guy would like it. There are some people would like it. They love it. The great American patriots and ICE, these are great American patriots."
01:01:14 - 01:01:33 (20 sec),"And we are on track for 1 million illegal aliens trying to rush our borders. It is an invasion, you know that. I say invasion. They say isn't that terrible? I don't know what these people are thinking. You know, it's your country two. What are you thinking? 300 Americans a week die from Mexican-trafficked heroin."
01:01:33 - 01:02:08 (35 sec),"300. Think of it, 300 a week. Tens of thousands of Americans are killed every year by heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, vast quantities of which are smuggled across our southern border. You know that. 78,000 people died and that's a number that's much, much smaller than the real number. To confront the border crisis last month I declared a national emergency on our southern border."
01:02:08 - 01:03:01 (53 sec),The radical Democrats retaliated by passing a reckless resolution to terminate vital border security operations. Can you believe this? In two weeks ago I proudly issued my first veto. And two days ago our great Republicans in the House of Representatives -- I won't get fancy with you I will just say they essentially gave us the right to build the wall and lots of money is pouring in. So we are building the wall.
01:03:01 - 01:03:34 (33 sec),We will be finishing the wall. It's moving along rapidly. We are giving out many additional contracts. We are going to be building it in many different locations simultaneously with different contractors. And sometime over the next two weeks I will be going to a certain place which I won't tell you now because they will be waiting for me. I will be going to a certain place and we are going to be showing you mast sections of brand-new beautiful walls.
01:03:34 - 01:04:02 (28 sec),"Because we are going to put the job to safety and to security of American citizens first. And you know when I campaigned it's going to be so much easier the second time. Remember this, I never did this before and I am one and one, right? We are 1 for 1. 1 for 1. [Inaudible] and it was tough. It was tough."
01:04:02 - 01:04:22 (20 sec),You know why? Because I get up on a stage and I've never debated before but I never left center stage. Right? Never left center stage meaning we were winning the whole time and I debated and I said where are these people coming from but I never did it and I never said to anybody I'm going to produce jobs.
01:04:22 - 01:04:48 (26 sec),I'm going to bring back your auto business. I'm going to do great for the vets. I'm going to do great for tax cuts. I'm going to cut regulations more than anybody in the history of our country in two years. I never said -- I couldn't say that. But I did say that I was going to do it but who the hell's going to believe me? Now I've done more than I ever promised I was going to do so the debate should be very easy.
01:04:48 - 01:05:32 (44 sec),"Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis. [Audience chants four more years] Thank you. Well, I'll give you a question, okay. So I told you before the lowest unemployment rates in the history of our country for African-American great citizens. Now I say that and it's like I say that and I just say your turn, what the hell are they going to do to beat that?"
01:05:32 - 01:06:05 (33 sec),"And we have many other things for every single citizen, everybody is benefiting. Everybody. Everybody is benefiting. So before -- so before first election, my first election. What the hell? I never did it before. I did a good job though do you think? So did you. So did you. You know the fact is we did it together and I've always said it. I didn't do it. We did it together."
01:06:05 - 01:06:48 (43 sec),"But -- but think about it now instead of saying I'm going to do this I'm going to produce 5.5 million new jobs, I'm going to bring back manufacturing 600,000 new jobs in a short period of time. Now I've done it. I mean it should be easy don't you agree? It should be easy. Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis for one simple reason because they have cause the border crisis and you know why else?"
01:06:48 - 01:07:21 (33 sec),"Honestly because they want boats and because they don't want to give us a win. They don't want to give us a win. They put that ahead of what's good for our country. The mass illegal immigration across our border is a direct consequence of Democrats supported loopholes, Democrat promises of amnesty, amnesty."
01:07:21 - 01:08:02 (41 sec),"You have people coming up here you know they are all met by the lawyers, the lawyers and they come out, they are all met by the loiterers and they say the following phrase I am very afraid for my life. I am afraid for my life. Okay. And then I look at the guy, he looks like he just got out of the ring, he's a heavyweight champion of the world, he's [Inaudible]. It's a big fat con job, folks."
01:08:02 - 01:08:41 (39 sec),"It's a big fat con job. And Democrat sanctuary cities and their refusal to protect American borders it's not the money. When I fought for them recently, they gave me so much money for everything else but nothing for the wall. Now think of it. Walls work, folks. We need the wall. They said would you call it slats?"
01:08:41 - 01:09:14 (33 sec),I said I'll call it slats. Would you call it steel barriers? I said I'll -- I said I'll call it whatever the hell you want just give me the money to build it and then they sort of got a little cold feet and now I call it the wall and I got the money anyway. So that's over. But there open border policies are truly a betrayal to the American people.
01:09:14 - 01:10:04 (49 sec),"This is dangerous what's coming into our country is dangerous. To defend the United States of America I deployed the United States military. I got thousands of troops. Right now we have about 4000 troops on our southern border and they are fantastic. And think of it, or years we defended the borders of foreign countries but we don't want to defend our own borders."
01:10:04 - 01:10:41 (38 sec),"Think of how crazy this is. We are defending borders of countries that are 6000 miles away that many of you have never even heard the name of these countries but our southern border, our border along Mexico where we have a lot of problems in drugs and human traffickers and child traffickers and all of this coming in, we don't want to defend our border."
01:10:41 - 01:11:12 (31 sec),"Think of that, how crazy that is. So now we are defending our borders for our country and the people of our country. In the last two years alone ICE officers -- we love ICE, have made listen to this though, 266,000 our risk of criminal aliens. Who the hell wants to do that? You don't want to do it, right?"
01:11:12 - 01:11:48 (35 sec),"You like what you are doing making cars, right? I like making cars I think better, too. But they like it. That's what they do. They are great at it including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,006 crimes, 4000 kidnappings and 4000 murders. Okay. We got them. They got them. How about if you don't get them?"
01:11:48 - 01:12:09 (21 sec),"How about if you leave all of those people? You know what that means for us don't you? The Democrats want to abolish ICE. They want to get rid of these very great patriots, these very tough people that love our country as much as anybody I've ever seen. They want to set violent offenders free and directly they will be coming in to your communities."
01:12:09 - 01:13:04 (55 sec),"We are not going to have it. We are not having it. We want our country to be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not for criminal aliens. Right? The Republican Party will always stand with the heroes of ICE and the heroes of Border Patrol. These are great people. Every day of my Presidency ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens and we are either throwing them behind bars or throwing them the hell out of our country."
01:13:04 - 01:13:35 (31 sec),"And we are throwing out gangs like MS 13. These are some of the sickest, most demented, most vicious people in the world. We are throwing them out of our country by the thousands. In recent months the Democrat party has also been aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion of allowing children -- to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth."
01:13:35 - 01:14:08 (33 sec),"And now we go a step further in Virginia. The Governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby, wrap the baby up, make the baby comfortable, to be executed after birth. That is why in my State of the Union address I called on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting the extreme late-term abortion of babies."
01:14:08 - 01:14:43 (35 sec),"The Democrat Party has never been further outside of the mainstream. They are being brought so far left you wouldn't like it folks. You wouldn't like it. You won't be happy. Radical Democrats are the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, hoaxes and delusions. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans."
01:14:43 - 01:15:12 (29 sec),"It's what we want to be. It's the way we want to live. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream. And every day we make good on the motto promises made, promises kept. Last week I signed in order to defend free speech on college campuses. And to keep America safe we are rebuilding America's military might making it more powerful than ever before by far."
01:15:12 - 01:15:37 (25 sec),I withdrew the United States from the horrible costly one-sided Iran nuclear deal and look what happened. Iran is a different country today than it was two and a half years ago. I recognized Israel's capital and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And just days ago I announced that the United States will recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
01:15:37 - 01:16:05 (28 sec),Very important. Very important. We also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and we strongly condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. We stand with the people of Venezuela and Cuba and Nicaragua and their righteous struggled to finally be free. We stand with them. Doing a lot of work.
01:16:05 - 01:16:46 (41 sec),"Socialism is not a good thing, you are right. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and the American rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way."
01:16:46 - 01:17:36 (49 sec),"We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, to honor our history, to be proud, to be happy, to love and always to respect our great American flag. [Audience chants USA] And we believe in the words and always will, we are not changing it, they want us to change a lot of things it's not happening of our national motto in God we trust."
01:17:36 - 01:18:25 (50 sec),"In God we trust. These are traditions, customs and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the magnificent lands of Michigan. These are the values that brought the incredible people of this incredible state to Grand Rapids for the very last rally of the 2016 campaign, probably the most exciting and hopefully the most fruitful campaign in the history of our country."
01:18:25 - 01:19:01 (36 sec),"On that historic day you rejected the failed political establishment that chipped away your jobs, sold out your sovereignty and tied us down in endless foreign wars which we are now winning and getting out. You stood up to the corrupt special interest and you stood up to the rigged Washington power structure."
01:19:01 - 01:19:53 (51 sec),"You have stood with me. You watched this rigged power structure. You were with me. I won't forget it and you will be very proud looking back that you did it. Thank you. You took back your country. You recaptured your destiny. You defended your dignity and you proudly reclaimed your freedom, maybe for a second time."
01:19:53 - 01:20:46 (53 sec),"You have always been loyal to your nation and now you have a President who is loyal to you 100 percent. The Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted but with us you will never ever be forgotten again. You will never be taken for granted ever, ever, ever. I am fighting for you and your jobs in your life in your community with everything that I have and I will never ever stop and we are winning so big."
01:20:46 - 01:22:21 (95 sec),"Nobody ever thought it could happen. We will always fight on to victory. Together we are going to make our beautiful stand. We are going to stand for justice, for safety, for sovereignty and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people and one United States of America.Because together with the very proud and very truly incredible and inspiring people of Michigan we will make America wealthy again. And we are doing it. We will make America stronger again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michigan."
00:00:00 - 00:00:28 (28 sec),"Shabbat, Shalom. Thank you. What a great day. Thank you, Norm, for that wonderful introduction and for your leadership of this truly tremendous organization. So many friends, I have so many friends out in the audience. Thank you very much for being here. [Audience cheers] Thank you. Thank you. [Audience cheers] Thank you very much."
00:00:28 - 00:02:11 (103 sec),"He's going back home to mommy and he will be reprimanded, he will be, right. She gets it. I'm truly thrilled to be back with so many friends, supporters, patriots, at the annual conference of the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is now setting records. Records. Here today is someone who has been with us from the very beginning, a true fighter for our shared values, your terrific Executive Director Matt Brooks."
00:02:11 - 00:02:43 (32 sec),"Thank you, Matt, thank you. Thank you, Matt. Also joining us are two great leaders. You know very well my good friends Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, great people. They like you both, Sheldon, it's pretty good. Last year was my honor to award Miriam The Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's a big deal. I also want to thank Senator Lindsey Graham, he's here, senator."
00:02:43 - 00:03:50 (68 sec),"Where's Lindsey? Senator Lindsey, great man, great friend, great friend of Israel. Thank you, Lindsey. A man who fights all the time for Israel and for everything else. Another great Senator David Perdue, Georgia. Senator Kevin Cramer. Where's Kevin? Kevin, Kevin, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. He fought a battle, you wouldn't believe it. He beats somebody by 11 points, that was unbeatable."
00:03:50 - 00:04:22 (31 sec),"That's pretty good, Kevin. I said, ""You can do it."" That was my only thing. I said, ""You could do it."" He won by a lot. He won by a lot, and he's a great gentleman and he's a big, big fan and supporter of Israel. As well as a really terrific leader, he's our leader, Kevin McCarthy. And we have representatives that are outstanding."
00:04:22 - 00:05:06 (45 sec),"The great Billy Long. Where's Billy? Billy? Billy Long. Denver Riggleman. Denver, thank you. Thank you, Denver. Michael Waltz. Thank you, Michael. Great job you do, Mike. And a very good friend of mine also, Lee Zeldin. And a special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota. Oh, oh, I forgot. She doesn't like Israel, I forgot, I'm so sorry, oh. No, she doesn't like Israel, does she?"
00:05:06 - 00:05:45 (39 sec),"Oh, please, I apologize. A great friend of mine, one of the most successful men in the state, amazing guy, tremendous businessman, Mr. Phil Ruffin. Where is Phil? Phil? Thank you, Phil. A competitor of mine in Manhattan for a long time, always built great buildings, great architecture, was known for design and success, loves Israel, George Klein."
00:05:45 - 00:06:11 (26 sec),"Thank you, George. Thank you, George. So many friends in Israel. We're also grateful to be joined by members of my administration, including Jason Greenblatt, and a young man named Jared Kushner. He is fighting for Israel. Thank you very much, great job. Peace in the Middle East. If they can't do it, nobody can."
00:06:11 - 00:06:35 (24 sec),"David Friedman, your ambassador to Israel. He loves Israel, so an incredible job. Thank you, David. Finally, to every member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, thank you for your incredible support and your outstanding commitment to our country, to our safety, and to electing more Republicans. We need more Republicans, let's go so we can win everything."
00:06:35 - 00:07:07 (32 sec),"Over the next 19 months, I know that the Republican Jewish Coalition will help lead our party to another historic victory. And by the way, we did very well at 18, you can ask David and Lindsey, we won the Senate. We took on two more. There were three or four that were very close, that weren't supposed to be. All of a sudden that didn't happen and we're going to talk about that, I think, when we get back to Washington."
00:07:07 - 00:07:29 (22 sec),"But I'll tell you what, we picked up two Senate seats and now it's 53 to 47. And we have 53 great senators, and when it comes to appointments, when it comes to the United States Supreme Court, when it comes To approving all of the judges way over a hundred judges, federal judges, you need the Senate, we did well."
00:07:29 - 00:07:58 (29 sec),"They don't like to talk about that. They don't like. And I don't have enough time so many people in the house, but the people I went for, like in Kentucky, Matt Barr, he's -- he won. He was down and he won. We won so much. We won in Georgia, great Governor Brian Kemp. They had President Obama, they had Oprah, they had Michelle Obama."
00:07:58 - 00:08:17 (20 sec),"They were going for their new star, their new star of the party, and I was going for Brian. All he had was Trump. You know what, Brian won. Brian won. And the governor of a great state, known as Ohio, you have a great governor. He was not expected to win. He campaigned brilliantly. We did some incredible rallies."
00:08:17 - 00:08:55 (37 sec),"He won by almost seven points, he won easily. So Mike is great. And the governor of Florida. Governor of Florida. That was supposed to be a close race and was a tough race, but we won that one and Oklahoma, and many other places, we did so well. We get no credit, fake news, we get no credit. We get no credit, let's just keep winning."
00:08:55 - 00:09:26 (32 sec),"I'd rather have it that way they get too much credit and not win, that happens true to some people, doesn't happen to me. When I spoke to you as a candidate three years ago, America's economy was stagnant. Our military was depleted and the relationship between the United States and Israel was at probably the lowest point in history."
00:09:26 - 00:09:53 (26 sec),"How the hell did you support President Obama? How did you do? How did you do it? How do you support the Democrats with you guys [Inaudible]. I think, probably most of the people in this room that, ah, you love Israel, but you know, you look at the Iran deal. You look at so much that was done so negatively."
00:09:53 - 00:10:28 (35 sec),"Now, just three years later, I stand before you as the president of the United States to report on a very different situation under Republican leadership. America's economy is the hottest anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. Our military will soon be more powerful than ever before, $700 billion, $716 billion this year."
00:10:28 - 00:10:57 (29 sec),"I don't know, David and Lindsey, I think, probably in the 750 to 725 range, have to do it. You don't have the military. You owe the stuff, doesn't matter, does it, huh? You don't have to worry about inflation. You don't have to worry about anything. You got to have a strong, strong military. We'll have the strongest that we've ever had before."
00:10:57 - 00:11:26 (29 sec),"And the incredible bond between the United States and Israel has never been stronger than it is right now. America's thriving, America's booming, and America is winning, winning, winning like never before. We're respected again, we are respected again. It's been a long time. Since the election, we've created more than 5.5 million new jobs, including 600,000 manufacturing jobs."
00:11:26 - 00:12:14 (48 sec),"Things that nobody would have allowed me to say on the campaign trail. They would have said, ""Oh, he exaggerates."" After years of stagnation, wages are rising fast. Think of it, people had one job 21 years ago. They made more money in real dollars than they did two years ago, with three jobs, and two jobs, and now, for the first time, they have a choice, our economy so strong."
00:12:14 - 00:12:35 (21 sec),"They can have a choice of jobs and wages are going up, first time in many, many years. And one of the things that makes me happiest, frankly, is that they're going up most quickly for the lowest income Americans. Great. Great? Great. Our unemployment has reached the lowest level in more than 50 years and we will be breaking that record, I believe, pretty soon."
00:12:35 - 00:13:02 (26 sec),"We slashed 30,000 pages of job killing regulations from the federal register, an all time record. It doesn't matter if they were there for four years or eight years or 10 years, in one instance. We really did something. We had -- take a look at FDR, all of those years, all of those years. Nobody slashed them like as yet a fourth-termer."
00:13:02 - 00:13:36 (35 sec),"You have a lot of two-termers and in less than two years -- and I happen to believe that that was as important and maybe even more important than the largest tax cut in the history of our country. Thank you also. We're fixing broken trade deals, we're working on a trade deal now with China, we're doing very well, very well because of tariffs."
00:13:36 - 00:14:10 (34 sec),"We're making a deal that's very good, you'll, be happy if it happens, might not happen, but we have tremendous power. We have to tell our people that represent us in Washington that when countries -- I'm not talking about China, I'm talking about many countries. When they're charging us 100% tax or tariff."
00:14:10 - 00:15:09 (59 sec),"When they're charging us 200 and 250 and 300%, and we charge them nothing, it's OK to charge them something. Maybe you could explain that to some of your people that say, ""Oh, we don't like tariffs."" I mean, we have a case where a certain country, India, is charging us. We're a great country, a great friend, Prime Minister Modi charging us over a 100% for many things."
00:15:09 - 00:15:52 (43 sec),"We're charging them nothing for similar or the same product, and I have senators that say you can't do that. It's not free trade. Where do they come from? Where do they come from? It's not free trade. I don't know. Where's David? You got to work on this pretty well, David. You -- Where's Lindsey? He used to work on that."
00:15:52 - 00:16:32 (40 sec),"It's the craziest thing. Its stupid trade. We have so much stupid trade. We lost, for many years now, $800 billion a year on trade. Who the hell makes these deals? You're, probably saying yourself. Those are not good negotiators. Actually, Democrats made a lot of money, but Republicans met a lot of them too."
00:16:32 - 00:17:02 (29 sec),"That's amazing thing, they made a lot, 800 billion, but we're getting it back, we're getting it back. We're going to be getting a lot of it. One thing, if they let me really do my thing, we'd get it back, but I have to be a little bit politically correct by saying, ""It's OK if we lose 20 billion with a country."" You know, because we want to be nice, wouldn't it be nice to everybody."
00:17:02 - 00:17:27 (25 sec),"We're cracking down on countries that cheat. We're replacing NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA. NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made. You know, many of you, people have factories and plants, they're still empty. They signed NAFTA, and it was that great, big, sucking sound."
00:17:27 - 00:18:13 (46 sec),"Remember that? Remember that? Ross Perot, a great big, sucking sound, it's what happened. They left, they went to Mexico, they went to Canada, they went to a lot of places. It was a bad thing for us, but we'll be ending NAFTA, hopefully very soon, very soon. And one of the things in the new deal is that it's very difficult financially for a company to leave the United States, fire all of its employees, move, let's say, to Mexico or Canada, open up a new plant, make a product, sell it in for no tax, so we end up with unemployment and nothing but loss and empty factories."
00:18:13 - 00:18:48 (35 sec),"That's not happening anymore, folks, not happening. We've ended the war on American energy and the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, bigger than Russia and bigger than Saudi Arabia, can you believe that? Can you believe that? Three years. Thank you very much."
00:18:48 - 00:19:27 (40 sec),"And we're working now on getting pipelines approved in Texas that would normally take 10, 12, 14, 15 years to get approved, and we're trying to get him approve very rapidly. And if we do that, we're going to pick up another 20 to 25%, we'll be leading by so much. We already are leading by a lot. So it all happened over a very short period of time and we've confirmed more than 100 new federal judges to interpret the Constitution as [Inaudible] And as Norm said, and I appreciate that, so important, Norm."
00:19:27 - 00:20:07 (40 sec),"We have confirmed two incredible Supreme Court justices, Neil Gossage and Brett Kavanaugh. Don't let the Democrats take it away from us, they'll take it all away, they'll take it all away, including the judges. With the help of Republicans in Congress, we have secured record funding for our military. Our military is now going to be stronger than ever before."
00:20:07 - 00:20:38 (31 sec),"Ever. Not even close we're developing new weapons systems, we're developing things that nobody even thought of. Levels of technology that nobody else has with all of that being said, if we can be smart, and if China and Russia, and maybe one or two others, if necessary, can be smart, we'd all be saving a tremendous amount of money, and that's OK with me, but we will be so far in the lead."
00:20:38 - 00:21:06 (28 sec),"We always have to be in the lead and thanks to our focus on burden sharing, $100 billion, more dollars, will be coming this year to NATO, think of that. Other countries, in certain instances, were getting an almost free ride. We protect them and they're delinquent. You know, I used a real estate term for George Klein."
00:21:06 - 00:21:30 (24 sec),"He understands it. He understands. We were delinquent. They were delinquent. I said, ""You got to pay."" President Obama got -- made a nice speech, but he forgot to mention you got to pay. President Bush was wonderful, they didn't mention, you got to pay and you got to meet it, not just mentioned you got to mean it. I said you got to pay, because we're in a position."
00:21:30 - 00:22:19 (48 sec),"Everybody wants us, but how do you do that when people aren't paying? How do you do that? We feel foolish. We feel like fools. We're not going to be fools anymore. We've been a fool as a nation for so long, we're not going to be fools anymore. Last year I withdrew the United States from one of the most dangerous one-sided deals ever negotiated the disastrous Iran nuclear deal."
00:22:19 - 00:22:44 (26 sec),"They wanted to kill Israel, they wanted to destroy Israel. And maybe you could explain to the young man that just got taken out what it means when a country shouts as they're signing the deal Death to Israel. Maybe you could explain that to him. We've now imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian dictatorship, and it is not the same country it was when I took power."
00:22:44 - 00:23:10 (26 sec),"When I took over the presidency, I will tell you, one of the first meetings I had was at the Pentagon. Great generals, great people. I wanted a briefing on Iran with 14 different sites, they're all very, very dangerous, blow ups, all over. They were either behind it, hey had mercenaries, they had money or they had their own soldiers there all over the Middle East."
00:23:10 - 00:23:37 (27 sec),"It's a whole different story today, folks. They have riots in the streets. They have very little money coming in. A lot of things have changed. North Korea, we're getting along with North Korea. Let's see how it works out, but we have a good relationship. Don't forget, I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un. When I first came in, they were setting rockets and nuclear explosions and a lot of things were happening."
00:23:37 - 00:23:55 (18 sec),"I can't tell you what's going to happen, how to walk from the one deal. Was it going to be a right deal, but -- but we have a great relationship, we'll see what happens, I hope we're going to be able to do something. Maybe, maybe not, but I hope we're going to be able -- Relationship is very important, you know that very well."
00:23:55 - 00:24:30 (35 sec),"We're confronting the deadly menace of radical Islamic terrorism. When I took office, just over two years ago, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. I held up a map, it was so much red. Red, meaning, them. All red, showing the different sites. Today, the ISIS caliphate has been 100% obliterated."
00:24:30 - 00:25:03 (33 sec),"100%. And my previous generals said, ""That it was going to take, sir, it will take two years."" I flew to Iraq. I met a different group of generals, ""Sir, we can do it in one week."" I said, ""You could take a little longer than that."" They did it in a few weeks. They were -- They are great, right? Raisin Cain."
00:25:03 - 00:25:26 (23 sec),"He's name is Raisin. ""What's your first name?"" ""Raisin."" ""Raisin? What the hell kind of -- What's your last name?"", ""Cain."" ""Wait a minute,your name is Raising Cain? I like you as a general."" I think -- that it's what I want. Even Sheldon Adelson likes that decision. The kind of guy he'd have. I also took another historic action that had been decades in waiting."
00:25:26 - 00:26:11 (44 sec),"The United States recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Because, unlike other presidents, I keep my promises. Every president, for many decades, said they were going to do that, and I understand really why. Because when it was determined that maybe I'd do it, maybe there was a chance."
00:26:11 - 00:26:47 (36 sec),"The calls I got from leaders of other countries were unbelievable. Presidents, dictators, prime minister, kings, queens, everybody, my phone was ringing off the hook. So I knew I was going to do it, so I left a message. I said, ""I'm going to call you next week."" They said, ""Could we speak to him soon?"". ""No, no. No, he's not available."" They'll call it lying."
00:26:47 - 00:27:11 (25 sec),"The fake news will say, ""That's a horrible lie."" I want to be nice. ""No, no I'll call you next week. I look forward to it."" I had so many calls after this. It took me like three weeks to make all the calls, but I knew what they were calling about. So I did it. I did it. Then I started calling people back."
00:27:11 - 00:27:43 (31 sec),"King, how are you, how have you been? ""I called you last week."" ""So what's up?"" ""Well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel and the embassy in Jerusalem."" I said, ""Look, I'm sorry, wish I would've known. I did it, I did it yesterday."" Right, it's much easier, but I now know why other president -- I don't really hold it against him other than they didn't keep their promise, right?"
00:27:43 - 00:28:15 (33 sec),"They didn't keep their promise, David. So that's the way it is, and we got you something that you wanted. I can tell you, Sheldon and Miriam, that is the most important thing, I think, that's ever happened in their life. They love Israel. So, I can now understand, because I always said, ""Why wouldn't they do it, why?"
00:28:15 - 00:28:48 (32 sec),"Why are they doing it? Why wouldn't they just do it?"" They campaign, ""We will do this and that -- Israel, Israel."" Then you folks go out and vote for them and then they don't do it, right? Four years, eight years, didn't matter, they won't do it, but you know what, they did it. We did a great job and we feel great about it. And then last week, Israel security, really so important."
00:28:48 - 00:29:20 (32 sec),"It's all about security, when you get right down, it's about security, so is No. 1 for me. I got to talk. We can talk healthcare we could talk a hundred different things without security. What does it matter? I stood with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyahu. How is the race going by the way? How is it? Who is going to win the race?"
00:29:20 - 00:29:44 (25 sec),"Tell me, I don't know. Well, it's gonna be close. I think it's gonna be close. Two good people, two good people. But I stood with the prime minister at the White House to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights is something I've been hearing about for a long time, the Golan Heights."
00:29:44 - 00:30:11 (26 sec),"So, I just talked to your Ambassador Friedman and not about this, they've been trying to get that approved, as you know, for 52 years they wanted recognition from the United States of the Golan Heights. They had 32 summits, meetings, big meetings over many, many decades about the Golan Heights. I'm talking to your ambassador."
00:30:11 - 00:30:43 (33 sec),"Gerard was there, Jason Greenblatt was there. I said, ""Fellas, do me a favor, give me a little -- a little history, quick, wanna go fast."" I got a lot of things I'm working on, China, North Korea. Give me a quickie. Norm, I said, ""Give me a quick little slice -- so I know it as well as Norm, but I don't want to spend quite as much time as he has spent studying it, but -- which has been his entire life, right?"
00:30:43 - 00:31:05 (22 sec),"So that 32 different summits, he starts going well. We need that as a high point, we need it for protection we need it for -- I said, I could -- How do you like the idea? They weren't even calling about this. How do you like the idea of me recognizing exactly what we're discussing? Because I agree, you need it. You need to hide, you need to hide."
00:31:05 - 00:31:41 (36 sec),"The great generals said, ""Always fight downhill. Never fight, uphill."" Battles are lost, for these generals want to fight uphill, right? You need to hide. So I said, ""David, what do you think about me recognizing Israel and the Golan Heights?"" He said, ""Would you actually do?"" It is a great deal because one of the most successful lines was gave it all up. In order to be your ambassador gave it all up. ""What do you think of it David?"" And he goes -- and this is a very strong, ambitious guy."
00:31:41 - 00:32:19 (38 sec),"He like it like a wonderful, beautiful baby, he said, ""Do you really -- You would do that, sir?"" I see -- I think, I'm doing it right now. Let's write something out. We make fast decisions and we make good decisions. Look, I made -- I made a lot of good decisions, I make good decisions and we get something beautiful talking about security."
00:32:19 - 00:33:04 (44 sec),"Talking about the greatness of Israel and I went, ""Bing, it was done."" Then I watched well look at all those cameras. Then I watched the fake news and they said, ""We have breaking news. President Trump has just committed to the Golan Heights."" And it was a big big story for two days. Everyone's happy, no repercussions and there won't be. I went there to protect Israel, so there won't be. We did the right thing, we did the right thing."
00:33:04 - 00:33:21 (18 sec),"And I want to congratulate Jared, and Jason Greenblatt, and david Friedman and all of the people they work with. And a big thing for me, and some of you won't like this maybe, but I would love to see peace in the Middle East, I would love to see peace in the Middle East. And if those three can't do it, you'll never have it done."
00:33:21 - 00:33:50 (28 sec),"It's never -- with me as president, with them doing the deal, you'll never have it done, so let's see if we can do it, who knows. Under my administration, the United States will always support Israel's right to self-defense. At the United Nations we no longer tolerate any form of anti-American, anti Israel, and anti-Semitic bias."
00:33:50 - 00:34:22 (32 sec),"We don't do it. For example, the United Nations Human Rights Council has repeatedly denigrated America and Israel. Why -- and you know this you've heard this while ignoring the world's worst human-rights abusers. That's why I withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights Council, and thank you to Nikki."
00:34:22 - 00:35:21 (60 sec),"Thank you to Nikki. Terrific job, Nikki Haley. With your help, we are making incredible strides on behalf of the American people and we are just getting started. [Audience cheers] Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And that guy that just said that, he used to hate me. Can you believe that? He used to hate me. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. But while Republicans fight to protect the jobs and safety of all Americans, Democrats are advancing the most extreme partisan agenda by far in American history."
00:35:21 - 00:36:10 (48 sec),"You see what's happening. You see what's happening. People aren't fighting for Israel in Congress, large numbers of people. You saw what took place three weeks ago. It was shocking that couldn't have happened. It could not have happened just a few years ago, could not have happened. If implemented, the Democrats radical agenda would destroy our economy, cripple our country, and very well could leave Israel out there all by yourselves, can't do that more than 100 Democrats in Congress are promoting the biggest government power grab in U.S history."
00:36:10 - 00:36:56 (46 sec),"The $100 trillion Green New Deal, proposed by a wonderful young bartender, 29 years old, 29. No, I like her, she's 29 years old. We take trains to Europe, Hawaii and Australia. That's a problem. The farming business is in big trouble, right. The auto business you get one car, somehow Detroit etc., you know bring in so many car companies in. I don't think they're going to be thrilled to hear that."
00:36:56 - 00:37:14 (18 sec),"We are -- we're built -- I tell you what, when you look at what's happening with the car companies, they're opening up in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and South Carolina, it's amazing, what's happening, we want to keep it going. You know, they could destroy what we've built very quickly."
00:37:14 - 00:37:43 (29 sec),"It does it -- that's why having Lindsey and David and all of the people that I mentioned, and so many more back in Washington really want to stop it, and we've got to win the election, we're going to win it, we're going to win a big. It will never be as easy as it looks. Over 120 congressional Democrats are also supporting a socialist takeover of our healthcare system that would take away private insurance."
00:37:43 - 00:38:11 (28 sec),"If you take a look at this, 180 million people will lose their private health insurance. And you're finally happy, you're happy. We've done a lot of work on that, you're happy. The radical Democrats are also pushing for a thing called -- If you can believe this, open borders. They want open borders, they want people to pour into our country."
00:38:11 - 00:38:42 (31 sec),"Last month, more than 100,000 illegal migrants were apprehended at our border. Apprehended. Think of this, hundreds of thousands of people. And we're on pace to apprehend more than a million illegal migrants this year, a million they're coming up because of the economy they're coming up because our laws are so bad from the Democrats."
00:38:42 - 00:39:09 (27 sec),"Catch and release you catch 'em and you release 'em. Oh, that's wonderful. If they put one foot on our territory, if they start climbing a fence and they're on the Mexico side. Welcome to the United States, think of it. It's the craziest thing. They have a visa lottery. Democrats, a visa lottery, a lottery, countries, a lottery."
00:39:09 - 00:39:53 (43 sec),"You pick out a name. Do you think they're putting their finest? Do you think they're putting their great people there? No and then people come in and you see what happens with the crime and murders, 4,000 murders last year, four thousand. How stupid can we be to put up with this? How stupid can we be? And the asylum program is a scam, some of the roughest people you've ever seen, people that looked like they should be fighting for the UFC."
00:39:53 - 00:40:23 (30 sec),"They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place, you know, my lawyers, they tell them what to say. You look at this guy, you say, ""Wow, that's a tough cookie."" I am very fearful for my life. I am very worried that I will be accosted if I was sent back home. No, no he'll do the acoustic."
00:40:23 - 00:40:59 (36 sec),"Asylum. Oh, give him asylum, he's afraid, he's afraid. We don't love the fact that he's got tattoos on his face, that's not a good sign. We don't love the fact that he's carrying the flag of Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador only to say he's petrified to be in his country. To confront this border crisis, I declared a national emergency."
00:40:59 - 00:41:29 (30 sec),"And David Perdue and Lindsey Graham helped me, a lot of people helped us. When congressional Democrats tried to reverse my order and terminate vital border security operations, I very proudly issued my first veto and they were not able to turn over the veto. So now we have -- in fact we have billions of dollars."
00:41:29 - 00:41:52 (24 sec),"We've started building walls -- actually, a while ago, from the first 1.6 billion and renovation of a lot of walls, we can do that a lot cheaper. We had walls that were potentially very good, but they were in very bad shape, they were old, we renovated it. We have got a tremendous amount, we're going to put out list, but we will have hundreds of miles before the end of next year."
00:41:52 - 00:42:29 (37 sec),"Hundreds of miles. And yesterday I traveled to the border in Calexico, California, and I saw a section of brand new 30 foot high steel wall, you want to be able to see through it. Got to see through it, got to see who's on the other side, beautiful wall, looks great, looks great. Walls build good neighbors, right."
00:42:29 - 00:42:48 (19 sec),"Now we we have to take care of ourselves and I have to say I said I was going to close the border. It's gotten so bad. I said we're closing the border and as soon as I said that, and I really thank the president of Mexico because they stepped up and now they are apprehending people on their southern border."
00:42:48 - 00:43:27 (39 sec),"Coming in from Honduras, El Salvador, and various other places,Guatemala and I stopped paying almost $600 million to those three countries. Now I got a lot of heat. The Democrats say, ""How dare you do that?"" That money is used for all these good, but no it's not it's largely stolen. I sent 600 million, we do, 600 million to three countries and they form caravans."
00:43:27 - 00:44:00 (33 sec),"Now, if the government wanted to, I have a feeling they'd be able to stop caravans from forming in those three countries. I have a feeling they're, pretty tough they're, pretty tough ad, but they did say, stop the payment. Do you mind? Are you okay with it? Because I've taken -- I've taken a lot of heat from the stupid people that say, ""Oh gee, we should keep..."" We have people that work with them that say we should be sending much more money."
00:44:00 - 00:44:22 (22 sec),"We should be building things they're, helping them. What about building our own country for a change? Wouldn't that be nice? Unfortunately, Democrats have refused to close immigration loopholes, that's really what it's all about. And again, Mexico is apprehended 14,000 people yesterday, a thousand people today, before they've never done this."
00:44:22 - 00:44:45 (23 sec),"Never to the extent, and I appreciate it, I appreciate it, but if they don't do it, I'm going to close the border or I'm going to do tariffs or the cars made in Mexico. They took 30% of our car business, by the way, I wasn't here when that happened, OK. I used to complain about it as a civilian. I complain, I said, ""What the hell is going on? They're taking our business."" They have 30% of our cars."
00:44:45 - 00:45:14 (30 sec),"They make 30% of our cars, they send them into our country, no tax, no nothing, essentially, and we lost a lot of jobs, but we're getting them all back now, we're getting more back. But I said we're either going to tariff those cars coming in at 25%, which is a tremendous amount of money. It's all about the cars, the cars are a big deal or we're going to close the border, and I will say this, Mexico has been great."
00:45:14 - 00:45:35 (21 sec),"The last four or five days, they've been great, first time first time. At the heart of, and I don't mind, closing the border. I'd say, you know, a lot of these fakers back there they say, ""He will never close the border."" It's too much. Well, you know, close the border. We stop about $500 billion worth of drugs from pouring into our country."
00:45:35 - 00:46:16 (41 sec),"You know, there are a lot of advantages too, a lot of advantages. I'm OK with it. I don't want to do it, but I'm OK with it, I'll do it. I'll do whatever is necessary to stop an invasion of our country. That's what it is. At the heart of the crisis are the 9th Circuit rulings in the Flores case and the Trafficking Victims, Protection Reauthorization Act, driving a staggering surge of illegal families and minors into the hands of our incredible border patrol people."
00:46:16 - 00:46:41 (25 sec),"They've done an incredible job. What they do is incredible, I was with them yesterday. So Congress must end catch-and-release so that illegal border crossers can be quickly and safely returned to their home. Get out. Sorry, get out, sorry, can't handle it. And I told my people yesterday, our country's full, we're full."
00:46:41 - 00:47:17 (35 sec),"Our systems full, our country is full, can't come in, our country is full. What can you do? We can't handle anymore? Our country is full, can't come in, I'm sorry, it's very simple. Never before has a major political party been more outside the American mainstream than the Democrats of today. They have become the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, witch hunts, and delusions."
00:47:17 - 00:47:45 (28 sec),"And now the Democrats have even allowed the terrible scorch of anti-Semitism to Take root in their party and in their country, they have allowed that, they have allowed that. House Democrats recently blocked legislation to confront the anti-Semitic movement to boycott and sanction Israel. Nobody could believe it, right."
00:47:45 - 00:48:15 (30 sec),"Nobody. You couldn't believe it. Republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism. We do, all of us. Earlier this year, I appointed a new special envoy to monitor and combat Anti-Semitism. We are grateful that he has joined us today, Elan Carr. Where is Elan? Thank you, great job, Elan."
00:48:15 - 00:48:47 (32 sec),"Elan is as good as I hear, he's going to do a great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Congratulations. At my State of the Union address. I was honored to have as our guest a Pittsburgh SWAT officer, brave guy. I was with him in the hospital who raced into gunfire during the horrific anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue."
00:48:47 - 00:49:48 (61 sec),"He was shot seven times badly injured. He endured 12 surgeries and he's gonna have to endure quite a few more. We are proud to have him here with us right now. If he wasn't there as bad as it was, as horrible as it was, it would have been much worse. He is a brave man, Timothy Mattson. Please stand, Timothy."
00:49:48 - 00:50:14 (26 sec),"Timothy. I saw him right after this horrible event, this horrible happening, and he was laying in the hospital he had bullet wounds all over, he's a massive guy. I looked at the chest, I mean, he's got like this and it's muscle. Thank God, you're massive and thank God, you had a lot of muscle because very few people got to take it when you took Timothy, and your friends had such respect for him."
00:50:14 - 00:50:44 (29 sec),"His fellow officers they had such respect. Thank you. Glad to see you better. That's great. Glad to see you better. Amazing what he what he went through. Today we also honor two more American heroes, Mordechai Lichtenstein and [Inaudible], I love that name. Both from Brooklyn. I know Brooklyn very well, my father Fred Trump, I loved my father."
00:50:44 - 00:51:14 (30 sec),"Brooklyn. Spent a lot of time in Brooklyn. You learn a lot in Brooklyn. You get through Brooklyn, you got to be smart. Two years ago, Mordechai and [Inaudible] traveled to Jerusalem, where they prayed at the Western Wall. Soon after they left the holy site, they saw a terrorist stabbing an innocent Israeli police officer, racing to the scene."
00:51:14 - 00:51:57 (43 sec),"Mordechai pull the attacker off the soldier and was about to be stabbed himself. It was happening when the badly wounded officer summoned the little strength that he had left and shot and killed this very violent terrorist. [Inaudible]] immediately took his prayer shot and wrapped it around the officer's wounds to stop the bleeding, which was profuse after the attack, the officer said of the two Jewish Americans."
00:51:57 - 00:52:41 (45 sec),"They were sent by God to save my life. For me, my family and the Druze people of Israel. I thank God from the bottom of my heart. That's the officer, thank you, Mordechai, [Inaudible], where are you? Stand up. Great job, thank you. Great job, great job. Thank you very much. Recently, Mordechai and [Inaudible] became the first non-Israeli citizens to receive the country's civil, exemplary declaration."
00:52:41 - 00:53:17 (36 sec),"That's a big deal. To Mordechai and [Inaudible] you are an inspiration to all of us to everyone in this room to everyone in our country. Thank you very much. The three American heroes we recognize today are a powerful reminder of the timeless values that bind us together. As one nation, and that forge deep and lasting friendship with the people of Israel, we honor our history."
00:53:17 - 00:54:22 (65 sec),"We treasure our traditions, we cherish life, we love our families, we defend our sovereignty, we fight for our freedom and we place our trust in the hands of Almighty God. These are values that unite us all as Republicans as citizens, as patriots, and as proud Americans. Every day of my presidency, we fight on behalf of hardworking citizens who pay their taxes, follow our laws, raise their children, protect our communities and make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of earth."
00:54:22 - 00:55:08 (45 sec),"This government is their government, and this land is home. These American patriots have always been loyal to our country, and we will forever be loyal we swear to them. The choice for our country's future has never been clearer than it is today. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans. It will be the party for great healthcare, you watch."
00:55:08 - 00:55:44 (36 sec),"We are the party of the American worker, we are the party of the American family and we are the party of the American dream. Alongside our friends at the Republican Jewish Coalition, we will keep on working. We will keep on fighting and we will be winning, winning, winning for the American people. With your help on November 3, 2020. Can you believe?"
00:55:44 - 00:56:19 (35 sec),"It's right around the corner. Think of it. Right around the corner. [Crowd cheering.] Thank you very much. We're going to win. By the way. One of the people, and then that was confirmed by somebody else today on the other side Democrats were saying that they would reinstate -- just reinstate the Iran nuclear deal."
00:56:19 - 00:56:51 (32 sec),"Well, this is what you have. They want to reinstate the deal. It was a disaster for our country. We gave $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. What does that look like? Airplanes loaded up with cash, how stupid was that deal, they want to reinstate it. Republicans are going to win the White House, we're going to retake the House."
00:56:51 - 00:57:20 (29 sec),"We're going to keep the Senate and we are once again going to be in a position, in my opinion, like never ever before, stronger than we've ever been before. There is more spirit for the Republican Party right now than I've ever seen. They keep talking about the spirit of the Democrat Party, there's more spirit for Republicans."
00:57:20 - 00:58:08 (48 sec),"In my opinion, by far, we may express it somewhat differently and that's OK, more spirit than I have ever seen, and I've now been doing this for a little while, not too long. I'm one for one, that's one for one. I want to be two for two and then relax. Together with the love, the prayers, and devotion of everyone in this room, incredible people and the millions of patriots across our land, we will make America great again for all Americans greater than ever before."
00:58:08 - 00:58:13 (5 sec),"Thank you, and God bless you all. God bless America. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:25 (25 sec),"Well, you better love me; I kept this place open, that I can tell you. They said, ""We're closing it."" And I said, ""No, we're not."" And now you're doing record business. The job you do is incredible. And I'm thrilled to be here in Ohio with the hardworking men and women of Lima."
00:00:25 - 00:00:43 (18 sec),And this is some tank plant. There's nothing like it in the world. You make the finest equipment in the world. You really know what you're doing. They just gave me a little briefing on a couple of those tanks. I want to get into them but then I remember when a man named Dukakis got into a tank.
00:00:43 - 00:00:59 (17 sec),"[Laughter] And I remember him; he tanked when he got into the tank. [Laughter] He tanked -- I never saw anybody tank like that. So I said, maybe I'll -- but I'm a little bigger than him; I think it probably would work out okay. How would I look in a tank? Okay? Yeah, not bad. Not bad."
00:00:59 - 00:01:26 (27 sec),"The helmet was bigger than he was. That was not good. [Laughter] We're here today to celebrate a resounding victory for all of you, for northwest Ohio, and for our great military, and for our entire country. Incredible victory. After so many years of budget cuts and layoffs, today, jobs are coming back and pouring back, frankly, like never before."
00:01:26 - 00:01:59 (33 sec),"Companies are coming back into our country; they want the action. Production is ramping up in the biggest way. And the awesome M1 Abrams tank is once again thundering down the assembly line. A-1. I want to thank Acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan. He's done an incredible job. In fact, ISIS -- let me tell you about ISIS."
00:01:59 - 00:02:01 (2 sec),They're not doing so well.
00:02:01 - 00:02:20 (19 sec),"You know, we took over the caliphate. You'll see it tonight. When I came in, it was a mess. Where the hell is that chart? [Laughter] Folks, they gave me all economic charts. They didn't give me the ISIS chart. But if you did -- bring it up if anybody has it. Bring it up. When I took over, it was a mess. They were all over the place."
00:02:20 - 00:02:42 (21 sec),"All over the -- all over Syria and Iraq. And you'd see it was a sea of red. And now you look at it and there's no red. No red. And you look at some of the economic numbers; nobody thought we'd ever see numbers like that in our country -- not a for a long time, not for ever. And what we're doing has been incredible."
00:02:42 - 00:03:07 (25 sec),"What you're doing has been more incredible. You stuck it out and now you've got one of the most successful military plants anywhere in the world. It's great. So thank you very much, Pat Shanahan. Also thank you to the Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper. He's been fantastic. Thank you. Oh, good."
00:03:07 - 00:03:23 (17 sec),"Better late than never. [Laughter] Here's the story: So, you know, I donât want to have them make a big chart because it costs too much. You know, I'm a business guy. They said, ""Sir, we could make a big chart."" I said, ""How much does it cost?"" Like it matters. But it matters to me. Does that make sense to you?"
00:03:23 - 00:03:23 (0 sec),[Audience calls out Yeah]
00:03:23 - 00:04:03 (40 sec),"So, two maps, identical -- except the one on top was Syria. See that? The one on top was Syria in November of '16. You remember that date? November of '16. November 8th. We had a little victory that night. We had a little victory. But a lot of us werenât surprised by it, but the other side said, ""Where did all of those people come from?"" [Laughter] And I said, ""They just didn't like candidates for a lot of years."
00:04:03 - 00:04:28 (25 sec),"They didnât vote."" So what happens is -- this is all ISIS. Now, on the bottom -- that's as of today -- this is ISIS. There's none. The caliphate is gone, as of tonight. Pretty good. Thatâs pretty good, right? We took over a mess. We took over a mess with North Korea. We took over a mess in the Middle East."
00:04:28 - 00:04:46 (18 sec),"We took over. A lot of bad things were happening and the economy was not doing well. It was heading in the wrong direction. You remember that. It was going to go bad, and then we opened up with the regulation cuts and all of the other things we've done, including the big tax cut. But it made a big difference."
00:04:46 - 00:05:10 (24 sec),"Made a big difference. And we'll show you some numbers in a little while. I want to also thank Major General Brian Cummings for the incredible leadership and service you have done. An unbelievable job. Thank you, Brian. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're also honored to be joined by several of the Ohio leaders, friends of mine -- terrific people: Senator Rob Portman."
00:05:10 - 00:05:46 (36 sec),"Rob, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Rob. A man who I will never, I promise, wrestle. He was one of the best wrestlers in the history of college wrestling. His record is so ridiculously good. I said, ""Were you as good as Dan Gable?"" He said, ""No."" See, if it were me, I wouldâve said, ""Yes, I was much better."" [Laughter] You know who Dan Gable is. Jim Jordan, a great guy."
00:05:46 - 00:06:11 (25 sec),"And a great champion. A great, great athlete. Great champion. Thank you. He is tough. You'll want to have him on your side. Another one you want on your side always is Mike Turner. Mike, thank you. Thank you, Mike. Great. Warren Davidson. Warren, thank you. And, Bob Latta, thank you very much."
00:06:11 - 00:06:45 (34 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Warren and Bob. And a man who we're very proud of because, along with Mike, he ran a great race: Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted. He ran a great race for Governor. We came in that final day -- they were a little bit down, against a tough opponent, who I was not a big fan of, and I didnât like the people that were supporting him too much -- Pocahontas and others."
00:06:45 - 00:07:01 (16 sec),"[Laughter] And I came that final day, and we had a day that was incredible and they won by -- what did you win by? Six or seven points, right? It was an incredible -- huh? Even higher. Thatâs pretty good. Good. I'll see Mike in a little while. Thatâs great. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Proud of you."
00:07:01 - 00:07:29 (28 sec),"To our plant leaders, Lieutenant Colonel Travis Adkins and Henry Kennedy -- we appreciate everything you do to keep the Army âRolling Alongâ full speed ahead. Incredible job. We're grateful to General Dynamics -- incredible company -- Phebe Novakovic. How did I do with that one?"
00:07:29 - 00:08:01 (32 sec),"Novak-ovic. It's a little tricky, but thatâs okay. What a job you do. Thank you. Great job. Thank you for the tour, too. And the hardworking members of the United Auto Workers. Now, you've got to get over to a place that I like a lot, Lordstown. And you've got to get that. You know, the only place -- General -- what's going on with General Motors?"
00:08:01 - 00:08:20 (19 sec),We have the best economy we've ever had. We have the lowest employment -- unemployment that we've had in 51 years; soon will be the record of all time. And what's going on with General Motors? Get that plant open or sell it to somebody and theyâll open it. Everybody wants it. Sell it to somebody or open it yourselves.
00:08:20 - 00:08:43 (23 sec),"Get it going now and the UAW will help you. The UAW -- you're going to help. The UAW just promised they're going to help. Get it open now. Don't wait. They said they have discussions coming up in September, October. I said, why not tomorrow? Why not on Monday? What do you have to wait months for?"
00:08:43 - 00:09:05 (22 sec),"Get the discussions going. Get it open. Lordstown is a great area. I guess I like it because I won so big there. [Laughter] But we're doing a job, and this state has been -- we're very proud of what's happened in Ohio under our federal auspices. We've gotten so many things done, and this plant is one of our great achievements."
00:09:05 - 00:09:47 (42 sec),"To all of our active-duty service members and our wonderful veterans, thank you for serving your country -- with such tremendous distinction and honor. And to every welder, and machinist, and assembler, and mechanic, and engineer, and electrician, and carpenter, and every patriot here at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center: Thank you for pouring out your heart and your sweat and your soul to help restore the might of the American military, which very soon will be stronger than it ever was."
00:09:47 - 00:10:16 (29 sec),"We've bought billions and billions of dollars' worth of new planes and tanks and many other things. So, thank you all. Great job. And the fact is we have the best tanks driven by the best soldiers, made by the best workers anywhere in the world. And thatâs true. A lot of people are asking, because they love me, and they ask me about a man named John McCain."
00:10:16 - 00:10:21 (5 sec),"And if you want, I could tell you about -- should I or not? Yes? Yes? [Audience calls out Yes]"
00:10:21 - 00:10:51 (30 sec),"So, I have to be honest: I've never liked him much. Hasnât been for me. I've really -- probably never will. But there are certain reasons for it, and I'll tell you. And I do this to save a little time with the press later on. John McCain received a fake and phony dossier. Did you hear about the dossier? It was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton."
00:10:51 - 00:10:53 (2 sec),Right? [Audience Boos]
00:10:53 - 00:11:14 (21 sec),"And John McCain got it. He got it. And what did he do? He didnât call me. He turned it over to the FBI, hoping to put me in jeopardy. And that's not the nicest thing to do. You know, when those people say -- because I'm a very loyal person. John McCain campaigned for years to repeal and replace Obamacare -- for years, in Arizona."
00:11:14 - 00:11:40 (26 sec),"A great state. I love the people of Arizona. But he campaigned, for years, for ""repeal and replace."" So did Rob and so did a lot of senators. When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against ""repeal and replace."" He voted against, at 2 o'clock in the morning. Remember ""thumbs down""? We said, ""What the hell happened?"" He said, two hours before, he was voting to repeal and replace."
00:11:40 - 00:12:08 (28 sec),"And then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican Party, badly hurting our nation, and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable healthcare. We would've had it. This would've saved our country over a trillion dollars in entitlements, and we would have ended up making a great healthcare plan, frankly, with the Democrats because they would have had no choice."
00:12:08 - 00:12:41 (33 sec),"McCain didnât get the job done for our great vets and the VA, and they knew it. That's why, when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got Choice and I got Accountability. Accountability -- meaning, if somebody mistreats our vets -- for 45 years they were trying -- they mistreat our vets, and we say, ""Hey, you're fired."
00:12:41 - 00:13:01 (20 sec),"Get out."" You can't mistreat our vets. They never got it done. And Choice -- for year and years, decades, they wanted to get Choice. You know what Choice is. You're a military person. You're one of our great people. To me, one of the great people. For many decades, they couldnât get it done."
00:13:01 - 00:13:26 (25 sec),"It was never done. I got it five months ago. I got it done -- Choice. Instead of waiting in line -- a vet fought for us, fought in these tanks; fought for us. Instead of waiting in line for two days, two weeks, two months -- people on line, they're not very sick. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill."
00:13:26 - 00:13:53 (27 sec),"We gave them Choice. If you have to wait for any extended period of time, you go outside, you go to a local doctor. We pay the bill; you get yourself better. Go home to your family. And we got it passed. We got it done. And the other thing is we're in a war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush -- President Bush -- all the time: ""Get into the Middle East."
00:13:53 - 00:14:20 (27 sec),"Get into the Middle East."" So now we're into that war for $7 trillion. Thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we're straightening it out now, but it's been a disaster for our country. We've spent tremendous wealth -- tremendous wealth -- and tremendous lives in that war."
00:14:20 - 00:14:42 (23 sec),"And what do we have? It's worse than it was 19 years ago. I call them the ""endless wars."" Nineteen years ago, when we started. So, John McCain loved it. I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted -- which, as President, I had to approve. I donât care about this. I didnât get ""thank you."" That's okay."
00:14:42 - 00:15:06 (24 sec),"We sent him on the way. But I wasnât a fan of John McCain. So now, what we could say is: Now we're all set. I donât think I have to answer that question, but the press keeps, ""What do you think of McCain? What do you think?"" Not my kind of guy. But some people like him, and I think that's great. Now let's get back and let's get on to the subject of tanks and this economy."
00:15:06 - 00:15:41 (35 sec),"Because you know what? We love what we are and what we do more than anything else. We build great, we fight great, and we're right now in Lima, and Lima is an incredible place, a place of strength and dedication. Since 1941, this plant has built and serviced thousands of tanks and military vehicles that powered American forces through World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan."
00:15:41 - 00:16:14 (34 sec),"And the tanks are the best in the world -- better than ever before. Every single Abrams tank in existence -- the steel and the aluminum warhorse; theyâre really a warhorse of American ground forces -- it was built or serviced on these very grounds by you people. By you people. But under the previous administration, this tank factory -- the last of its kind anywhere in the Western Hemisphere -- came very close to shutting down."
00:16:14 - 00:16:40 (26 sec),"Four straight years, the number of U.S. tanks that were budgeted for upgrades was zero. Does anybody remember that? Raise your hands. Do you remember that? Zero. That was under your great President Obama. Our military readiness declined and your workforce was slashed by 60 percent. But those days are over."
00:16:40 - 00:17:09 (29 sec),"We are rebuilding the American military. We are restoring American manufacturing. And we are once again fighting for our great American workers. Over the last two years, we have secured nearly $1.5 trillion to provide our warfighters the finest aircraft, ships, missiles, and tanks anywhere on Earth. We make the best equipment on Earth."
00:17:09 - 00:17:38 (29 sec),"And we sell that equipment, as you know, to good allies. Although, sometimes the good ones turn out to be not so good, and then we do something. We figure it out. You know what you have to do? You figure it out. This year, weâre asking for an additional $750 billion, which is a record. That includes funding to upgrade more than 160 mighty M1 Abrams tanks."
00:17:38 - 00:18:12 (33 sec),"Congratulations. Congratulations. These historic investments are making America safer and our workforce stronger. From the awe-inspiring F-35 fighter in Texas to the Ford-class aircraft carriers in Virginia -- weâre now building the largest aircraft carrier anywhere in the world. In fact, Iâm hearing itâs actually the largest ship ever built."
00:18:12 - 00:18:40 (29 sec),"It is seriously big. I was there recently. Itâs something -- itâs like landing at an airport, although you have to be very talented, still, to land on those decks, no matter how you figure it. Some people can do it and some people can't. Some very good pilots can. To advance missile defense systems in Alabama, American workers are building the most cutting-edge, modern, and powerful military anywhere on the planet."
00:18:40 - 00:19:02 (22 sec),"At the heart of our military rebuilding is our investment in the legendary M1 Abrams tank. And I will tell you, the investment has paid off because the technology is so -- if you look at this tank from now, and you go back 10 years and look at the tank, itâs a like a whole different -- itâs a whole different deal, isnât it? A whole different deal."
00:19:02 - 00:19:24 (22 sec),"Over the next three years, weâre investing more than $6 billion in upgrades and modifications to these tanks -- thatâs going to keep you very busy here -- almost twice the amount spent in the entire eight years of the previous administration, which was going down to nothing. Because you were closed; this place was closed."
00:19:24 - 00:19:45 (22 sec),"And I heard about it. And I got calls from Jim Jordan and Rob, and everybody, saying, âYou just canât do this.â And after I studied the situation, I said, âWeâre not only not going to close in Lima, weâre going to expand.â And thatâs what took place. So you owe a lot to a lot of your great political leaders."
00:19:45 - 00:20:21 (36 sec),"Our investment -- our investment in you is also a tremendous win for American taxpayers. By modernizing this plant and accelerating production, we will bring the cost down by 20 percent, saving taxpayers nearly $3 million on every single tank. Thatâs not bad. With the help of everyone in this room, we are giving our warriors the most effective, reliable, and lethal battle tank in the history of war."
00:20:21 - 00:20:52 (31 sec),"Would you say thatâs correct? So how does this compare with the tanks made in China and Russia and other places? What do you think? Can we take them? They say itâs much better. America does not need conflict. But if conflict comes, and you know the story -- youâve got to be strong if conflict comes -- we will dominate the battlefield, and we will win, win, win."
00:20:52 - 00:21:30 (38 sec),"Weâre now set up to win, win, win. When I came in, we had some big problems. You look at what weâve done on so many fronts. And we actually have better relationships. They respect our country more than theyâve ever respected it. Our country is respected again. The United States is respected again. To help meet our military needs, I am very proud to report that 400 new jobs are coming here to Lima, compared to just a few years ago, and weâre doubling the size of your workforce."
00:21:30 - 00:22:00 (30 sec),"We need to. Our investment will also support thousands of additional jobs across our nation to assemble these incredible Abrams tanks. The engines are from Alabama, transmissions are from Indiana, special armor from Idaho, and the 120-millimeter gun -- and the gun parts from upstate New York and from Pennsylvania."
00:22:00 - 00:22:46 (45 sec),"All great places. In Ohio alone, almost 200 suppliers churn out parts and materials that go into every tank that rolls off this factoryâs floor. Incredible. What you achieve here at this plant is truly remarkable. And equally remarkable is that they wanted to close it. No good. Every day you start with a powerful, heavy, but sometimes rust-covered, hollowed-out hull -- and with incredible skill and extraordinary care -- you restore its unmatched power, strength, and glory with all brand new equipment inside."
00:22:46 - 00:23:19 (33 sec),"The best in the world. The amazing restorations you accomplish every day are a perfect symbol for what we're doing with American manufacturing all across our nation. And we just came out -- another chart -- we just came out with numbers -- the Economic Report of the President: 3.1 percent GDP. The first time in 14 years that we cracked 3, right?"
00:23:19 - 00:23:43 (24 sec),"That's pretty good -- 3.1. The press tried to make it 2.9. I said, ""It's not 2.9."" What they did is they took odd months. I said, ""No, no, no. You go from January to December. You don't take certain months and add them up."" Because I said, ""We're going to break 3."" And we did. We did 3.1. The fake news tried to change it but we caught them."
00:23:43 - 00:24:15 (32 sec),"[Laughter] I said -- I said, ""You know, we didn't break the 3. Oh, that's terrible."" They said, ""Yes, sir, you did. They just took odd months."" I said, ""No, no, January to December."" 3.1 percent, first time in 14 years. Congratulations. Sort of incredible. It's true. This chart is a beauty. This is ""Venture Capital Deals Surged Following the Passage of"" -- really, the election -- rising nearly $17 billion."
00:24:15 - 00:24:49 (34 sec),"You know what that means. So here's your charts -- going along -- and here's us. See the red line there? It's like a rocket ship. Can you see that? It's small but cheap -- [Laughter] -- and it gets the point across, right? A couple of other things -- because I think this report is incredible. So these are ""Workers Coming Off the Sidelines,"" and now it's just -- this is just partially."
00:24:49 - 00:25:11 (22 sec),"So, the blue. The blue. The red. That's a big difference. That's a tremendous difference. The most in many, many years. And everyone said, ""You couldn't do it, couldn't bring back manufacturing jobs."" Remember? ""You'd need a magic wand."" We're bringing them back beyond anybody's expectations. You see the red line here?"
00:25:11 - 00:25:42 (30 sec),"These are ""Wages are Rising for the Workers."" These are ""Wages are Rising."" 3.4 percent -- it's one of the largest increases in 20 years. And for the most part, they were going down. They weren't even rising. I used to campaign -- I'd be in Ohio, I'd be in Pennsylvania, I'd be all over, and I'd talk about wages where people would have to work three jobs and they were making less than they did 20 years ago."
00:25:42 - 00:26:04 (22 sec),"You remember that, Rob? Jim? I used to do it all the time. I'd be -- it was just a part of my speech. I'd say, ""You're working three jobs. You make less money than you did 20 years ago."" And it was literally 21 years. And now wages are going up. And you have something else that's happening. If you don't like working here -- and you all do -- and I don't want to lose anybody."
00:26:04 - 00:26:23 (20 sec),"And who the hell would want to leave this place? This is what you call a great -- a great place to work. But if for any reason -- if for any reason you did, you can pick out six, seven, eight other jobs. In other words, you can finally have a job that you really like, where you like getting up in the morning."
00:26:23 - 00:26:47 (24 sec),"I do. I do, even though I have the fake news hounding me all the time. The fake and phony and corrupt. It's fake. It's corrupt. But we got to live with it, right? Got to live with it. But you guys -- you do; you get up in the morning, you love to come, and you love your job, or you wouldn't be doing what I just witnessed back there when I looked at some of these incredible tanks."
00:26:47 - 00:27:09 (21 sec),"And here's another chart: ""Deregulating and Saving"" -- through the roof. Here's a chart: ""The American Energy."" The United States is the largest producer -- that's happened over the last short period of time -- of crude oil and natural gas in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. We're also a net -- do you think Russia is happy about this?"
00:27:09 - 00:27:35 (26 sec),"I don't think so. You know, Hillary wanted to put windmills all over the place. Let's put up some windmills. ""When the wind doesn't blow, just turn off the television, darling, please."" [Laughter] ""No wind out today. There's no wind. Please turn off the television, quickly."" [Laughter] Put the windmills up and watch the value of your house -- if you're in sight of a windmill, watch the value of your house go down by 65 percent."
00:27:35 - 00:28:01 (26 sec),"Wonderful to have windmills. And solar is wonderful too, but it's not strong enough and it's very, very expensive. So the United States is now the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Happened all in that very short -- you know, you guys are all so -- think of that. Think of that, beating out Saudi Arabia and Russia."
00:28:01 - 00:28:25 (24 sec),"They're pretty good producers, right? Guess what? We do more than they do. And in a short period of time, as soon as we get some pipelines opened in Texas, we'll be able to almost double it. Double it. What we're doing is incredible. We approved the Keystone Pipeline. Right? I did that. Forty-eight thousand jobs between that and the Dakota Access Pipeline."
00:28:25 - 00:28:46 (21 sec),"I got them approved, like almost my first couple of days in office. I said, ""They're approved."" And what is it? It's good environmentally. It's underground. You're not riding it over tracks. You're not trucking it. It's actually a great thing, environmentally. But President Obama, after years and years and years, they said, ""We're not going to approve it."" I said, ""We'll approve it."" Forty-eight thousand jobs."
00:28:46 - 00:29:06 (20 sec),"Think of it. It's being built right now. They're both being built. One just got completed -- Dakota Access. And many, many other cases like that. Plants all over the country are going up. But the thing that's the greatest is companies that left us -- they no longer wanted to be in the USA -- they're coming roaring back."
00:29:06 - 00:29:30 (24 sec),"Toyota -- $13.5 billion. We've created more than almost 6 million jobs since the election. And if I would have said that to the fake news during the campaign, they would've said, ""He exaggerates."" I'm not exaggerating, but nobody would've believed that could happen. Including almost 600,000 manufacturing jobs."
00:29:30 - 00:29:58 (28 sec),"We could've taken your jobs, all. If it werenât for me, this place would've been closed. Would have been closed. Would have been closed, fellas. And you're doing us a favor because of the great job you do. It's not just a one-way street. You're doing us a favor. Last year, our manufacturers reported the highest level of optimism ever recorded in a 40-year-old poll."
00:29:58 - 00:30:36 (37 sec),"And this year we went up again. Went from 56 percent -- and it stayed there for years, between 50 and 56 -- to 94 percent. They've never had anything like it. Thatâs optimism. And we -- all of us -- are living by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. Very simple. Unemployment has recently reached the lowest rate in 51 years."
00:30:36 - 00:31:02 (27 sec),"Other than that, we're not doing well. [Laughter] More -- and think of this: More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million people. More than ever before, by far. And if you look at African American -- you've heard me say this many times -- African American employment is at an all-time low -- unemployment."
00:31:02 - 00:31:32 (30 sec),"Asian American unemployment is at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment -- an all-time low. Women's unemployment -- 65-year low. Soon it'll be historic, meaning better than ever. And soon the basic number will be historic. We've reduced the number of unemployed veterans by nearly 50 percent. I'm so proud of that."
00:31:32 - 00:32:01 (29 sec),"Thatâs why the veterans like me more than other people. That's why they like me. Fifty percent since the election. And veteran unemployment is now at the lowest level ever, ever, ever recorded. Thanks to our pro-American tax, regulatory, and trade policies -- and, by the way, we're doing great in our deal with China."
00:32:01 - 00:32:28 (26 sec),"They were taking out 500 billion a year for many years from our country. I consider that we've rebuilt China. Five hundred billion, not million. Think of what that means. Five-hundred billion dollars a year taken out of our country. And now they're paying us. They're paying tariffs on the products they're sending in, and we're negotiating and they want to make a deal."
00:32:28 - 00:32:50 (22 sec),"And hopefully, we'll make a deal. And if we don't, thatâs fine. And if we do, thatâs fine. It's got to be a good deal. It can't be a bad deal. We're so far down, it's got to be a great deal. If itâs not a great deal, we'll never catch up. And their economy is way down. And I donât want their economy to be down; I want their economy to be up. But their economy is down 32 to 38 percent."
00:32:50 - 00:33:11 (22 sec),"And our economy, if you look at the numbers, since my election, is up almost 50 percent. Fifty. Thatâs some difference. And the world economy -- the world economy is not good. And frankly, if the world economy were good, that would be, in a way, good for us. So we're fighting there. We're bucking."
00:33:11 - 00:33:36 (25 sec),"Europe is down, Asia is down -- a lot of places. Almost every place is down. Except the United States is up. And we're way up. And just think of what that would be. The world goes up; we go up with the world. The world is down, but we still go up. Something is happening. That wouldnât happen under Barack Obama, that I can tell you."
00:33:36 - 00:34:19 (43 sec),"It wouldnât happen under Crooked Hillary Clinton. [Laughter] Last week, as I said, Toyota announced a massive investment. They're going to be expanding factories all across our nation. And they're going to be soon building new ones. Ford is bringing hundreds of new jobs to Chicago and other places. Tremendous amount of car companies are coming into the great state of Michigan, and they're coming into the great state of Ohio."
00:34:19 - 00:35:10 (50 sec),"Volkswagen is creating 1,000 brand new jobs in the state of Tennessee. And Chrysler is building Detroitâs first new car factory in a generation -- so long ago -- in a generation. Think of that. Michigan. Michigan. You know, the nice part about running for President this time, as opposed to last time -- last time, you know, I said I was going to do it, but I didnât do it. But I said I was going to do it. This time, I've done it far greater than I said I was going to do it. So it's going to be really easy on the debate stage when they hit me with nonsense and I say, ""Really?"
00:35:10 - 00:35:45 (35 sec),"But African American unemployment -- the best it's ever been."" Hispanic, Asian, women, everybody -- itâs all the best itâs ever been. How do you top that in a debate? What are they going to say? ""Uh, well, it could be better""? [Laughter] No, the easy part -- and I say this to all of your political leaders here -- if you do a good job, it's a lot easier that second time."
00:35:45 - 00:35:57 (12 sec),"But nobody has done the job that we've done. And I say ""we"" because you've been on our side. Your union leaders aren't on my side, by the way. I watched them on television. They're not. But the unions -- the people that work there are on our side. It's true. It's true. I had -- [Audience chants Trump]"
00:35:57 - 00:36:18 (21 sec),"I had union leaders in the White House a few months ago -- the biggest guys. Nice guys, but they're Democrats no matter what. Okay? And you see where that's taken you. That would've been catastrophic. But I had them in, and we explained how good it was for the car industry, for this, for that. They said, ""Oh, thank you, sir."
00:36:18 - 00:36:46 (28 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this is unbelievable. Thank you, sir."" But then I see one of the guys the next day on a television show. The -- I think it was called ""Deface the Nation."" [Laughter] And -- ladies and gentlemen, ""Deface the Nation."" And he's saying how he's a Democrat and he wants Democrat policies -- which were, by the way, putting everybody in the poorhouse."
00:36:46 - 00:37:16 (30 sec),"But I just left the guy. He's hugging me, kissing me, telling him what an unbelievable deal. Nobody else could do it. And the next day, he's on there talking about stuff. And I really said, ""I sort of don't want to meet these guys. I want to deal with the people in the union, not the heads of the union."" Because the heads of the union are not honest people."
00:37:16 - 00:37:48 (31 sec),"They're not honest, and they ought to lower your dues, by the way. They ought to stop with the dues. They -- you're paying too much dues. As an example, they could've kept General Motors. They could've kept it in that gorgeous plant at Lordstown. They could've kept it. Lower your dues. Lower your dues."
00:37:48 - 00:38:17 (30 sec),"Americaâs Founders understood that to be strong and powerful as a nation, we must also be a great manufacturing nation. President Obama said, ""You'll never bring manufacturing back."" I said, ""What are you talking about?"" It's all about manufacturing. And we're bringing it back in record numbers. Nobody can believe it. And these are talented jobs."
00:38:17 - 00:39:00 (43 sec),"These are great jobs. These are genius jobs. And these are really well-paying jobs, as you people know. You get a lot of money. Letâs negotiate. [Laughter] We must not be dependent upon others for the resources we need to protect our people. When we open this plant, a couple of my people -- I have some good business people -- they said, ""Let's make a deal with the workers before we open it. We'll make a great deal."" I said, ""I agree we can do that, but we're not going to do that."
00:39:00 - 00:39:17 (17 sec),"These people have suffered enough."" We're going to open the plant and everybody is going to be happy. You understand what I mean by that. That's why my administration is restoring Americaâs defense industrial base by bringing great jobs and great wages to plants just like this in Lima. Economy and strength is security."
00:39:17 - 00:39:40 (23 sec),"And it's all about security and national security. It's about loving our country. It's about loving our flag. You know that. Now, as result of my very tough trade actions -- something I'm very proud of -- America's steel and our steel mills are roaring back to life. You know that. You see it all over."
00:39:40 - 00:40:10 (31 sec),"We put a big, fat beautiful tariff on that dumped steel. It's sand steel. It's mud steel. It's crap steel. And they're dumping it all over. I said, ""That's okay, you can dump but we're going to charge you 25 percent when you come in and think you're going to take our jobs and give us bad steel."" I know a lot about -- I've used a lot of steel."
00:40:10 - 00:40:34 (24 sec),"Right here in Ohio, Nucor has just announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a brand new, 150-million-dollar steel plant in Cuyahoga Heights. JSW Steel is restarting the furnace -- that's a massive furnace -- and investing $500 million in Mingo Junction."
00:40:34 - 00:41:03 (29 sec),"And Cleveland Cliffs announced a brand new, 700-million-dollar plant in Toledo, Ohio. Don't leave here, though. Donât leave here. Don't get any ideas. Don't get leave here. Just stay here. Just relax. Stay here. We don't want you going to Mingo Junction. We're also finally fixing the horrible trade deals that have cost our nation trillions of dollars and where we've lost millions and millions and millions of jobs, like we were stupid people."
00:41:03 - 00:41:28 (25 sec),"They closed a plant; they move it to Mexico. They make the product; they sell it right in the United States. No tax. All we end up with is loss and no jobs. We get no taxes. We get nothing. That doesn't happen anymore. Under our new deal, there's a tremendous financial disincentive to close up plants and move them to other countries."
00:41:28 - 00:41:43 (15 sec),"You're not going to see that anymore. And we're getting rid of the disaster known as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated in the history of the world. All over the country, you still see empty plants, when they haven't been converted to nursing homes and apartments, right?"
00:41:43 - 00:42:10 (27 sec),"It's not the same thing as a plant. I love apartments. I love the business. But that's not the same thing as a plant where you have 5,000 people working. Not the same thing. And replacing it -- we're replacing NAFTA with the great U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Like the song. If you can't remember -- YMCA, right?"
00:42:10 - 00:42:31 (20 sec),"We'll play the song for you, everybody. USMCA. We've taken historic action to confront Chinaâs trading abuses, because the days of stealing American jobs and our ideas and our wealth have come to an end, folks. They've come to an idea, all right? They've come to an end. We've made some progress."
00:42:31 - 00:42:57 (26 sec),"That's why you see these numbers. Look at that chart. Look at that. You don't have to know what's on it. What difference -- look at the line. [Laughter] You don't have to know what the hell is on it. All you know is thatâs a good line. [Laughter] Technological positive change. That's okay, right? It's all like that."
00:42:57 - 00:43:42 (45 sec),"That's what it is. Rob, Jim, that's what it is. Turner, see that? Look. That's what we fight for, right? Huh? That's what we're all fighting for. In everything we do and every action we take, we're putting America first, and we are putting American workers first, for the first time in a long time. So just in closing, I'd like to now introduce a couple of truly incredible workers from right here -- I guess you know these folks -- right here at the tank plant to share quickly their stories with you."
00:43:42 - 00:44:05 (23 sec),"Adam Stahler is a Quality Engineer who has worked at the plant for 10 years. His son, Derek, is a Specialist with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas. Great Place. Derek operates and maintains Stryker personnel carriers, one of the vehicles produced right here in Lima. Adam, thank you for everything your family has done for our nation."
00:44:05 - 00:44:07 (2 sec),"Please come up and say a few words. Adam, thank you."
00:44:07 - 00:44:55 (49 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. It's a pleasure and an honor to be up here today as a representative of the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center. For those of you who don't me, my name is Adam Stahler. I'm a Quality Systems Engineer employed here going on 10 years. Growing up in the area and currently living in Wapakoneta, I have witnessed the highs and lows the economy has had on this facility and the region."
00:44:55 - 00:45:10 (15 sec),"I'm proud that this administration recognizes the importance of this facility and the value we provide to the warfighter. It is very rewarding to have a son serving the United States military, where he is stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, working on a quality vehicle produced by my brothers and sisters at JSMC."
00:45:10 - 00:45:11 (1 sec),My son thanks you.
00:45:11 - 00:45:13 (1 sec),"And for that, I thank you."
00:45:13 - 00:45:23 (10 sec),"Boy, you're a young guy. How old are you?"
00:45:23 - 00:45:24 (1 sec),Forty-five.
00:45:24 - 00:45:27 (3 sec),Wow. You look like your son.
00:45:27 - 00:45:28 (1 sec),"Oh, thank you."
00:45:28 - 00:45:54 (26 sec),"Thank you. I thought Adam was the son. Look how young he looks. [Laughter] He's got a son working out there? Wow. Whatever you're eating, Adam, keep eating it. [Laughter] It's working. Jay Baldwin is a Boiler Operator and a proud Army veteran. After serving as a tank crewman on the M1, now Jay helps build the M1 right here."
00:45:54 - 00:45:57 (3 sec),"You know him. Jay, please come on up."
00:45:57 - 00:46:12 (16 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President, for coming to our plant in Lima, Ohio. As a former Army M1 tanker, I can honestly say that we make the best tank in the entire world. Our workers here are very proud to be making such a fine product for our soldiers to have the benefit and best capabilities on the battlefield."
00:46:12 - 00:46:37 (24 sec),"And thanks to our great President, his military and economic policies have rejuvenated this facility to increase production of armored vehicles and hiring of more skilled workers. And finally, it is my personal opinion that God was looking after our country when you were elected. Mr. President, thank you for everything you have done."
00:46:37 - 00:46:44 (8 sec),"Thank you, truthfully."
00:46:44 - 00:47:08 (24 sec),"Wow. Thank you. Thank you. That's so nice, Jay and Adam. I appreciate it. You never know what you get when you come up. It's live. [Laughter] But you couldnât do better than that, right? Thatâs great. Thank you, fellas. Thatâs great. I want to also thank all of the patriots here today. You remind us that the might of Americaâs armed forces also depends upon the skill and devotion of all of America's workers."
00:47:08 - 00:47:39 (31 sec),"And you really are doing a job. Weâre very proud of you. For nearly 80 years, the exceptional workers at this plant has embodied the strength of the American spirit. Those who choose to work here are drawn not just by the promise of a good paycheck but by the power of patriotism -- every single one of you is a patriot -- the chance to go to work every morning to help protect this nation that we so deeply love."
00:47:39 - 00:48:15 (36 sec),"Thatâs why veterans make up more than one third of the workforce at this wonderful plant. We very much stress: We want, wherever we can, we want veterans. Thatâs why you check -- right? Thatâs right. And thatâs why you check and recheck every bolt, every single thing having to do with that incredible tank -- every pin, every wire, every square inch of each tank before it leaves the floor."
00:48:15 - 00:48:39 (24 sec),"And I just got a little news that was given to me as I was walking up. U.S. forces, in the last month, have killed the terrorists responsible for the attack in Syria that killed four Americans, the Paris theater attack in 2015, and the USS Cole bombing in 2000. We killed them all. We killed them all."
00:48:39 - 00:49:33 (54 sec),"We killed them all. We killed them all. Theyâre bad people. But thatâs why you show up early and you stay late, and always get the job done right. Youâre proud of your work. You do it better than anyone, anywhere in the world -- what you do. No country on Earth can match you and no country can match what you do. In just a few months, we will commemorate the 75th anniversary of one of the many victories that workers at the Lima Army Tank Plant helped make possible: the Normandy landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944, in the Second World War."
00:49:33 - 00:49:47 (14 sec),It was right here on these very grounds that thousands of American workers modified M4 Sherman tanks in preparation for a battle that would forever change the course of human history.
00:49:47 - 00:50:18 (32 sec),Right here. The workers who rallied to the Lima plant came from all over northwest Ohio and beyond. They were farmers and refinery workers and shopkeepers and homemakers who rolled up their sleeves and got to work when their country needed them the most. Normandy. Many of them had full-time jobs elsewhere.
00:50:18 - 00:50:47 (29 sec),"They punched out at one job, then came here and punched right back in. Not for the money. They knew and fully understood the importance of what they did and what they represented. And if they were lucky, they might catch a few hoursâ sleep on the loading dock before doing it all again, day after day, day after day."
00:50:47 - 00:51:20 (32 sec),"In just three years, the patriots of Ohio cranked out more than 100,000 military vehicles -- a truly amazing feat that helped give America the power to vanquish tyranny, defeat our enemies, and save freedom for the entire world. This is the legacy that each of you inherits. And America knows you will carry it forward with the same purpose and passion that you've poured into this factory each and every day."
00:51:20 - 00:51:57 (37 sec),"We love you. We see your legacy in every battlefield victory, in the smiling faces of every soldier that returns home safely, and every time a citizen proudly salutes our great American flag. Because it is here in Lima -- right here -- that American greatness is forged with American hands, with American heart, and with American pride."
00:51:57 - 00:52:30 (32 sec),"True. True. We donât know what challenges will come, what dangers we must face, or what opportunities we must seize. But we know that America will always be ready because of you and your strength, and your skill and your drive, and your unbreakable spirit. Because of hardworking citizens like you, the people of Lima, the people of Ohio, and the people of America will always fight on to victory, victory, victory."
00:52:30 - 00:53:08 (38 sec),"You donât know how to lose. You never will have to find out. Youâll never have to find out about losing. Together, we shall forever be one nation, under God. So I want to thank you. I want to say God bless you, God bless Ohio, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody.Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:38 (38 sec),"Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you very much also to a man named Matt Schlapp. What a job he's done. And to CPAC -- I actually started quite a while ago at CPAC, and came here -- probably made my first real political speech. And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third."
00:00:38 - 00:01:16 (38 sec),"Then I said, what the hell, let's run for President. Right? But it's wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives. What a future you have. Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited. What we've done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world."
00:01:16 - 00:01:55 (40 sec),"They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities. They came from all over. And what we did in 2016 -- the Election, we call it, with a capital ""E"" -- it's never been done before. And we're going to do it, I think, again in 2020, and the numbers are going to be even bigger. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:01:55 - 00:02:20 (24 sec),"And we all had to endure, as I was running. So you had 17 Republicans, plus me. [Laughter] And I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican. People just didnât quite understand that. They didnât understand it. I think now, with what we've done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well."
00:02:20 - 00:02:48 (29 sec),"And it's driving the other side crazy. But we all had to endure, remember? How many times did you hear, for months and months, ""There is no way to 270""? You know what that means, right? ""There is no way to 270."" They couldnât get me there. We might as well have just given up. But there wasnât any way to 270. In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one."
00:02:48 - 00:03:36 (48 sec),"But we didnât need the one. We didnât need it. We won Maine. We won our half of Maine, remember? You have Nebraska. We won both in Nebraska. We won the half we had to win in Maine. So we got the one, but we didnât need the one, because we didnât get 270; we got 306 to 223. 223-306. A state called Wisconsin, a state called -- Michigan, where -- by the way, where Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion incredible -- expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce."
00:03:36 - 00:04:12 (36 sec),"Many, many car companies have moved back to Michigan and are continuing to do so. Big numbers. Nobody every thought they'd see that happen. So I think we're going to do even better in 2020. I think we're going to do numbers that people havenât seen for a long time. The men and women here today are on the frontlines of protecting Americaâs interests, defending Americaâs value, and reclaiming our nationâs priceless heritage."
00:04:12 - 00:05:07 (55 sec),"It's true. With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals. These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for. It's been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense. It wasnât ""America first."" In many cases, it was ""America last."" Those days are over."
00:05:07 - 00:05:43 (36 sec),"Long over. America is winning again. America is respected again. And the world knows it. When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents -- and I get along with them -- because they know that what's taken place over many years -- not just the Obama administration; long before that -- they can't believe, themselves, that they got away with it. They can't believe it. An impossible thing."
00:05:43 - 00:06:14 (31 sec),"And they like me. And the reason they like me -- they tell me; they say, ""Mr. President..."" I said -- as an example, President Xi of China, I have great respect. We have a great relationship. I say, ""How is it possible that you got away with this for so long?"" [Laughter] And he said, ""Because nobody ever asked us to change."" It's true."
00:06:14 - 00:06:43 (30 sec),"When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent and then to 40 percent -- and they said to me, ""We expected that somebody would call and say you can't do that."" [Laughter] ""Nobody called, so we just left it."" And I donât blame them."
00:06:43 - 00:07:16 (33 sec),We shouldâve been doing the same thing to them. But we didnât. True. Right? Hard to believe. It's hard to believe. But now things are different. Now we're negotiating with China. They wouldnât negotiate with previous administrations. But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich -- really rich.
00:07:16 - 00:08:07 (51 sec),"The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty. But, fortunately, they werenât terminated. We started getting politically correct, even back then. But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws? And I checked, and I found 301 and 382. I found one, 1938, where we can do what we have to do. But, you know, they had a debate in -- it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we didnât know what the hell to do with it. Tough, tough, tough."
00:08:07 - 00:08:29 (22 sec),"It was called the Great Tariff Debate. Mark Levin will look this up. [Laughter] And the problem is, with Mark, if I make a little mistake, he'll let us know on Sunday night. [Laughter] I got to be very careful when I talk about this. But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888. And the debate was: We didnât know what to do with all of the money we were making."
00:08:29 - 00:08:44 (16 sec),"We were so rich. And McKinley, prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country. And he made statements that, ""Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country. We can't do that. We can't ever allow that to happen."" And, you know -- I don't know, maybe you know."
00:08:44 - 00:08:45 (1 sec),"You know I'm totally off-script, right? [Audience member calls out]"
00:08:45 - 00:09:02 (16 sec),"Thank you, darling. [Laughter] You know I'm totally off script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off script. True. And if we donât go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks. Because we have to get it back. And when I look at what's happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, ""No, no..."" -- I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it -- [Audience Boos] [Audience Boos]"
00:09:02 - 00:09:43 (41 sec),"The Green New Deal, right? Green New Deal -- I encourage it. I think it's really something that they should promote. [Laughter] They should work hard on. It's something our country needs desperately. They have to go out and get it. But I'll take the other side of that argument only because I'm mandated to. I'm mandated."
00:09:43 - 00:09:59 (16 sec),"But they should stay with that argument. Never change. [Laughter] Never change. No planes. No energy. [Laughter] When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric. [Laughter] Let's hurry up. ""Darling"" -- ""Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling."" [Laughter] No, but it's true."
00:09:59 - 00:10:46 (47 sec),"So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 -- and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted. We built forces up that were incredible. Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay? They ended tariffs. Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs. They said, ""Oh, it's okay for other nations to come in."" I won't use a certain words because it's not politically -- but everybody knows the word I'd love to use."
00:10:46 - 00:11:13 (27 sec),"Should I use it? I won't do it. Our great First Lady always said, ""Don't use certain words, please."" I said, ""But the audience wanted me to do it."" She said, ""Don't do it."" And the problem is, if I do do that, they won't put the little preamble that we just went through. They'll just use the word, and they'll said, ""Isn't that terrible."" So I won't use it. [Laughter] I've learned."
00:11:13 - 00:11:14 (2 sec),Because with the fake news -- [Audience Boos]
00:11:14 - 00:11:59 (45 sec),"-- if you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, ""Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please."" ""Please get us the emails. Please!"" [Audience chants Trump]"
00:11:59 - 00:12:19 (19 sec),"So everybody is having a good time. I'm laughing, we're all having fun. And then that fake CNN and others say, ""He asked Russia to go get the emails. Horrible."" [Laughter] I mean, I thought -- like, two weeks ago, I'm watching and they're talking about one of the points. ""He asked Russia for the emails."" These people are sick."
00:12:19 - 00:12:49 (30 sec),"[Laughter] And I'm telling you, they know the game. They know the game, and they play it dirty -- dirtier than anybody has ever played the game. Dirtier than it's ever been played. But the thing that we've done is very special. Because, on trade, and because of tariffs -- and I know there are people in the Republican Party and people -- really, even conservatives -- good conservatives -- they donât like tariffs."
00:12:49 - 00:13:14 (26 sec),"I'm not liking or not liking. The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country. Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over? Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods. I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion."
00:13:14 - 00:13:59 (45 sec),"Not like $200 million -- that's a lot. This is 200 with a ""B"" -- billion. Two-hundred billion. So -- but I was nice, because we're having a very strong negotiation, which if it werenât for tariffs -- and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide. I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position."
00:13:59 - 00:14:22 (23 sec),"But in my case, it can't, because it's true. I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion. And here's the beauty: We've lost so much money with China -- $500 billion a year. And on trade, it's such a disaster; it's $507 billion a year. China -- just one country. We lose with everybody, almost."
00:14:22 - 00:14:54 (32 sec),"But China is one country. $507 billion, for many years. So the beauty is this: I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on. The numbers are staggering. Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury. And for those of you that havenât done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country -- as it's turned out, because it's now been on there for a long while."
00:14:54 - 00:15:24 (29 sec),"Our -- and I'm in no rush because I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it. Of the 25 points, we've paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points. Okay? Twenty-one. Thatâs what the numbers are. It's very simple. You know, everyone said, ""Oh, it's a tax on our..."" It's not really. And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it. So the tax really is incredible."
00:15:24 - 00:15:38 (14 sec),"But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate. But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not Mark Meadows. Where is the great Mark Meadows? He's here someplace. Man, has he been good. Mark and Jim Jordan, and -- I want to name every one of those couple of hundred people."
00:15:38 - 00:15:57 (19 sec),"Because we do have a lot. I want to name every damn one of them. They have been incredible. They've been fighting. And I just see Mark in the audience. They've been fighting -- with Deb, much more important. His wife is incredible. What an asset. He would be nowhere without her. [Laughter] Right?"
00:15:57 - 00:16:20 (22 sec),"But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it's dying. So they donât have anything with Russia. There's no collusion. So now they go and morph into, ""Let's inspect every deal he's ever done. We're going to go into his finances."
00:16:20 - 00:16:39 (19 sec),"We're going to check his deals. We're going to check..."" These people are sick. [Laughter] They're sick. I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday. No, it's the first time. He went into a meeting and he said, ""We're going to look into his finances."" I said, ""Where did that come from?"" He always talked about Russia -- collusion with Russia."
00:16:39 - 00:16:55 (17 sec),"The collusion delusion. [Laughter] So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out whether or not, and who we're dealing with. We're waiting for a report by people that werenât elected. We had -- think of this: We had the greatest election -- in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson."
00:16:55 - 00:17:25 (30 sec),"This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I'm not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater. You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan, when I first started. ""This is Ronald Reagan."" Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote."
00:17:25 - 00:17:50 (26 sec),"Those red hats -- and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. ""Make America Great Again,"" is what it says. Right? Right? But we had the greatest of all time. Now we have people that lost. And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there."
00:17:50 - 00:18:15 (24 sec),"And, all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit. Okay? [Laughter] With bullshit. Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the Attorney General says, ""I'm going to recuse myself."" [Laughter] ""I'm going to recuse."" And I said, why the hell didnât he tell me that before I put him in? How do you recuse yourself?"
00:18:15 - 00:18:49 (35 sec),"But the person that appointed Robert Mueller never received a vote. Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission. [Laughter] Now, how do you do that? These are angry, angry people. You take a look at them. One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen."
00:18:49 - 00:19:10 (21 sec),"[Laughter] All killers. In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put half and half, and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he'll probably do. But we have conflicts. I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why isnât that mentioned?"
00:19:10 - 00:19:27 (17 sec),"He wanted the job as FBI Director. I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it. Why isnât that -- and I didnât give it to him. Why isnât that mentioned? Jim Comey -- Lyin' James Comey -- [Audience Boos]"
00:19:27 - 00:20:11 (44 sec),"-- is his best friend. James Comey is his best friend. And those are a few of the conflicts. Other than that, it's wonderful. [Laughter] So -- so everybody is waiting. I thought of it this morning, Mark. And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement today. Mark Levin. I heard it was incredible."
00:20:11 - 00:20:38 (27 sec),"And I was on the way. But I'll see it later. I guarantee I'll be watching it later. I have one of the great inventions in history. It's called TiVo. [Laughter] I think it's actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right? [Laughter] But I'll be watching it later, Mark."
00:20:38 - 00:21:03 (25 sec),"But people that got no votes. But I heard this morning, ""President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report."" I said, wait a minute, let me get this straight. [Laughter] So the Attorney General recuses himself, and I donât fire him. No obstruction. That's the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it's called obstruction."
00:21:03 - 00:21:31 (28 sec),"But only for Trump. For nobody else. [Laughter] So the Attorney General is weak and ineffective, and he doesnât do what he should've done. Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter -- horrible -- about Comey. Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired, or worse, if possible. [Laughter] Every Republican said -- everybody -- in fact, when I fired Comey, I said, ""You know..."" -- First Lady -- I said, ""Melania, I'm doing something today."
00:21:31 - 00:21:59 (29 sec),"I'm doing it because it really has to be done."" He's bad. He's a bad, bad -- he's a bad, bad guy. That's been proven now with all of the emails and the texts. ""I'm doing something that has to be done. But you know the good news? It's going to be bipartisan. It's going to be so popular, it's going to be bipartisan."" [Laughter] Every Democrat hates him."
00:21:59 - 00:22:30 (30 sec),"Every Republican hates him. He did a horrible job at the FBI. Speak to the real agents, the real people. Because the people in the FBI are incredible people -- not the sleaze on top. And I said to the First Lady -- I said, ""But you know the good news? The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan."
00:22:30 - 00:22:56 (27 sec),"Everyone is going to love it."" So we fire Comey. And Schumer -- who called for his resignation many times -- Podesta, I believe that day -- because he still hasnât gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay? I believe that day called for his resignation. That day. Podesta, the great genius of campaigns."
00:22:56 - 00:23:27 (31 sec),"[Laughter] He called for the Comey resignation. Others -- almost every, I would say. Mark, would you say virtually every Democrat, virtually every -- I can't think of anybody that said he's doing a good job. So I said to Melania, ""Melania, the good news, this will be a popular thing."" [Laughter] And I fire a bad cop."
00:23:27 - 00:23:54 (27 sec),"I fire a dirty cop. And all of a sudden, the Democrats say, ""How dare he fire him. How dare he do this."" And that's where we are, folks. That's where we are. We're in this swamp of Washington, D.C. But you know what? We're winning, and they're not. We're winning. So, just to finish -- and I'll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this."
00:23:54 - 00:24:18 (23 sec),"[Laughter] He's saying, ""This is a lot more than we paid for."" You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, ""Bye, folks."" But you know what I like about this? Number one, I'm in love, and you're in love. We're all in love together. We've done something that nobody has ever done. Right?"
00:24:18 - 00:24:40 (22 sec),"It's easy. No, it's easy. You know, a great friend of mine from New York, he's a stone-cold killer. He's a brutal man. He's actually not even a good friend of mine because he'd turn on me in two seconds if it was [Inaudible]. [Laughter] But he's a very rich guy. And he said, ""What are you going to speak about today?"
00:24:40 - 00:25:08 (27 sec),"Like, what are you going to speak?"" I said, ""I don't know. I don't know."" [Laughter] He said, ""I just heard that you have the biggest crowd in the history of CPAC. They're all over. By the way, not only in this giant room. They're in many hotel rooms all over the place. You're just better at real estate than they are."" [Laughter] True."
00:25:08 - 00:25:54 (46 sec),"But this guy -- you all know his name -- very rich guy. And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking. If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes. [Laughter] He can't breathe. You know, juh-juh. ""Are you okay?"" He kills people for a living -- meaning mentally and financially -- but if there's like an audience of nine, it's like ""augh."" [Laughter] So he said to me, ""How the hell do you do that?"" And I said, ""It's easy."" And the reason it's easy -- I really mean this -- there's so much love in this room, it's easy to talk."
00:25:54 - 00:26:28 (34 sec),You can talk your heart out. You really could. There's love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. And we've had that from the day I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in Trump Tower. It's been easy. And you know what? We never had an empty seat.
00:26:28 - 00:26:59 (31 sec),"We went out and helped Ted Cruz. We went out and helped so many people. And I'll tell you what: If we didnât do those 32 rallies -- and it wasnât easy. When you're doing rallies with 25-, 30,000 people -- in Texas, we had 109,000 people sign up. We used the Houston Rockets arena; it holds 22,000. Tens of thousands were outside."
00:26:59 - 00:27:34 (35 sec),"We were sending notices, ""Please donât come."" That's a little different. Usually, people are begging. ""Well, yeah, like can somebody come?"" [Laughter] We never had an empty seat. Of course, the Washington Post -- a guy named David Weigel -- he wrote an article, some arena -- [Audience Boos]"
00:27:34 - 00:28:30 (56 sec),"No, listen to this. He wrote an article. He got there four hours early. He took pictures of an empty arena. He then put out a note -- something to the effect, ""Not very good crowd size, Mr. President."" And I never saw it because I donât follow the guy. But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that couldnât get in -- he got there four or five hours early because he doesnât fly private."
00:28:30 - 00:28:49 (19 sec),"You know. [Laughter] And maybe it's because of the carbon footprint. You think maybe that's it? [Laughter] Maybe. Must be the carbon footprint. He just doesnât want private. But he got there hours early. And, you know, the place hadnât started taking in people. They werenât going to take them in. So there were virtually nobody."
00:28:49 - 00:29:11 (22 sec),"And, you know, whatever it was -- 18,000 -- when you have nobody, it's a little scary-looking. So he took pictures. And you know who really got even? Our people. Because they were incensed. We had people sitting on the stairwells. We had people sitting in every seat. I donât think we've had an empty seat since we announced."
00:29:11 - 00:29:31 (19 sec),"And from the day we came down the escalator, I really donât believe we've had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium. It's been an incredible thing. And that's why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in 2020 with an even bigger victory. [Applause, Audience chants Four More Years]"
00:29:31 - 00:29:53 (22 sec),"And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great Sarah Huckabee and Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here -- Mercedes, thank you. They always say -- you know, they're good people, right? Much better than I am. They always say, ""Don't bring it up. Donât fight. Donât fight."
00:29:53 - 00:30:22 (29 sec),"Everyone understands."" I said, ""They donât understand."" If I donât explain it, how are they going to understand? So remember the arena one, right? And then it was shown. And the Washington Post had to do -- and this particular writer -- had to do a -- I thought he was going to get fired. I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot."
00:30:22 - 00:31:09 (47 sec),"He would've been humiliated for what he did. Because it was fake news. Nobody was in the arena. There were thousands outside but they hadnât opened the gates yet. They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean -- how horrible."
00:31:09 - 00:31:30 (21 sec),And I watched it by mistake. [Laughter] And they showed -- they showed from the White House all the way down. They showed from the Cap- -- they showed -- there were people. Nobody has ever seen it. The Capitol down to the Washington Monument -- people. But I saw pictures that there were no people. [Laughter] Those pictures were taken hours before.
00:31:30 - 00:32:02 (32 sec),"Right? And they always mention crowd size. ""He talks about crowd size."" So I'm constantly bugging Mercedes. Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, ""Mercedes"" -- and Sarah -- ""show them the pictures. Show them. And compare them with what they put on television. Those pictures were taken hours before."" And remember this also -- not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument."
00:32:02 - 00:32:27 (25 sec),"And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet. And women and men -- and I consider them totally equal, so I'm not going to say it's harder. [Laughter] In fact, it's probably, with the men I know, it's actually easier for the women to make the walk, right? [Audience Calls Out No]"
00:32:27 - 00:32:52 (25 sec),"But they had to walk all the way down. They had to walk with high heels, in many cases. They had to walk all the way down to the Washington Monument and then back. And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on -- I said to the people that were sitting next to me, ""I've never seen anything like this."
00:32:52 - 00:33:18 (26 sec),"Look at that crowd."" And it was wide. Wide. We had a crowd -- I've never seen anything like it. And I have to live -- I have to live with ""crowd size."" It's all a phony deal. But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken hours before our great day. That was a great day for us. That was a great, great day."
00:33:18 - 00:33:48 (30 sec),"People came from all over. People came from all over. So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, ""Sir, it doesnât matter. Nobody cares."" I said, ""But I care."" [Laughter] And people care. People care. So what I'm going to do is I'll give it to the great one. I'll give it to Mark Levin. And I'll give him the picture."
00:33:48 - 00:34:21 (34 sec),"Then I'll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field -- like nobody on it. And you'll see the sun. You know, you can see it's very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right? [Laughter] And you can have some fun. You're going to get big ratings on your show, I'll tell you that."
00:34:21 - 00:34:56 (34 sec),"Sunday night, everybody. Sunday night. Huh? Ten o'clock, right? Sunday night at 10 o'clock. [Audience Member Calls Out, Trump laughs] Thank you. I knew that, actually. But thank you. All right, now let's get back to what I'm here for. [Laughter] And don't fall asleep. Donât fall asleep, right? Donât fall asleep. You know, somebody said, ""Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible."" They said it was incredible."
00:34:56 - 00:35:30 (35 sec),"They said that was so great. And I said -- I said -- I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there. [Laughter] Of course, by the following morning, they had to change because the head people called up, ""What are you doing?"" [Laughter] A lot of it is not the people on television, you know."
00:35:30 - 00:35:51 (20 sec),"A lot of it is their bosses -- which someday we're going to have to figure out why, Meadows, why that is. Because, you know, if you're building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we've ever had. More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country."
00:35:51 - 00:36:19 (28 sec),"And you say, why are they upset by that? Why? Why are they upset by that? We've slashed 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record in the history of the United States, even by Presidents there for eight years, and in one case more. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history."
00:36:19 - 00:36:46 (28 sec),"And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal. Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare. It should. The great state of Texas has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate. Now that it's gone, I don't know how they rule against it. Now we'll have to find out."
00:36:46 - 00:37:14 (27 sec),"But that'll soon be up in the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope. And we're going to see what happens. And then we're going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay? Really great healthcare. And of the other things we did in our tax package is ANWR. Perhaps the largest field in the world -- oil and gas."
00:37:14 - 00:37:40 (26 sec),"I got it approved. And I didnât want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Donât get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I donât want to get it. Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he's in the oil business."
00:37:40 - 00:38:16 (36 sec),"He's not asking for anything. He said -- but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas. He said to me, ""Hey"" -- and they all call me ""Mr. President."" I have friends that, for 35 years, ""Hey, Don, how you doing? Hey, Donny. I love you, Donny."" For 35 years. Now they call, ""Mr. President, sir."" [Laughter] ""How are you?"" I have a friend -- a very rich guy -- Richard LeFrak, in New York."
00:38:16 - 00:38:45 (29 sec),"A builder. A good builder. He calls me all my life, ""Hey, Don, how you doing?"" I've known this guy so long -- from kindergarten. [Laughter] It's true. ""Hi, Don, how you doing? How's everything?"" And now I get a call the other day, ""Mr. President, how are you, sir? How are you?"" I said, ""Richard, lighten up. Lighten up."" [Laughter] ""Call me 'Donald'."" ""Richard, call me 'Donald'."" You've known me for -- I donât want to say, because I donât want my wife to hear the number."" [Laughter] But -- it's true."
00:38:45 - 00:39:18 (32 sec),"Actually, that's true. That's actually true. Richard came up; he said, ""I've known your husband for 65 years."" I said, ""Donât say that."" [Laughter] I say, ""Say 25, 30. Donât say 65 years."" But I said, ""Richard -- Richard, call me 'Donald', like you always do. Call me 'Don'."" ""Okay."" ""Okay, Don. Okay."" He gets his breath."
00:39:18 - 00:40:04 (46 sec),"Uh-huh. Two minutes later -- ""Mr. President..."" [Laughter] That's called respect for the office, right? Maybe that's a good thing, right? Many -- many of my friends. And that wasnât in the script either, Mark. [Laughter] But we're renegotiating, right now, horrible trade deals that we're cracking down -- and we are really doing a number -- cracking down on countries that cheat, and standing up for the American worker for the first time in many, many decades."
00:40:04 - 00:40:29 (25 sec),Many decades. Our workers have been treated horribly. A country announces they're closing their plant in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Ohio -- they're closing. They're closing a plant; they're going to move to Mexico. They're going to move to China. They're going to move someplace else. They fire all their workers.
00:40:29 - 00:40:58 (29 sec),"And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in Mexico, sell them back to here. No tax, no nothing. Those days are all gone, folks. They're all gone. They're all gone. And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it's very, very hard -- prohibitively hard -- for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location."
00:40:58 - 00:41:19 (21 sec),"It's now a very costly -- they can do it, I guess, if they want. But it's costly. It's painful. It used to be almost -- I said -- I used to -- I've been talking about this for a long time. I used to say it's almost like we're giving them an incentive to leave our country. Again, I'm for America first. That wasnât for America first."
00:41:19 - 00:41:35 (16 sec),"And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country. They're coming back in. They're coming back in. And, by the way, you know I'm building the wall. We're finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It's in the thing. [Audience chants Build that Wall]"
00:41:35 - 00:42:25 (50 sec),But -- and there will be some people in the room that donât like this. We're down to 3.7 percent unemployment -- the lowest number in a long time. But think of this: I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place.
00:42:25 - 00:42:40 (15 sec),"This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we've been. Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in. We need workers to come in, but they've got to come in legally, and they've got to come in through merit, merit, merit. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:42:40 - 00:43:09 (29 sec),"They've got to come in through merit. They have to be people that can help us. They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country. We have people in Congress -- right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country. [Audience Boos]"
00:43:09 - 00:43:33 (24 sec),"And you know that. And we can name every one of them if they want. They hate our country. It's sad. It's very sad. When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it's very, very sad. Very, very -- and find out, how did they do in their country? Just ask them, how did they do? Did they do well?"
00:43:33 - 00:44:09 (36 sec),"Were they succeeding? Just ask that question. Somebody would say, ""Oh, that's terrible that he brings that up."" But that's okay, I donât mind. I'll bring it up. [Laughter] How did they do in their country? Not so good. Not so good. But we need workers. We have to bring in workers. One other thing -- because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes."
00:44:09 - 00:44:32 (23 sec),"We have some senators. We have some congressmen. When a senator tells us that he's a free trader, so am I. I'm a fair trader. I'm a free trader. But when a senator said we can't do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we're able to use this tremendous power that I found -- tremendous -- old stuff."
00:44:32 - 00:45:00 (28 sec),"Nobody even knew it existed. I'm able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals. They wouldn't even be talking to us because it's so one-sided. Last year, we lost eight hundred -- this for many years -- almost $800 billion on trade. It's not sustainable. You can't do that. And now we're making great trade deals."
00:45:00 - 00:45:28 (28 sec),"But when some of the senators -- good people; I think they're good people. I just don't understand the thinking. So I say, India is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot. When we send a motorcycle to India, it's 100 percent tariff. They charge 100 percent. When India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing."
00:45:28 - 00:45:53 (24 sec),"So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax. It's called a mirror tax, but it's a reciprocal tax. Now, here's what I don't understand: I've had a lot of people -- Lindsey Graham. I said, Lindsey -- it's not his thing necessarily. It's not the thing that he's most adept at. But he's adept and he's smart."
00:45:53 - 00:46:14 (21 sec),"I said, ""Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci-..."" If they charge us, we charge them. He goes, ""That makes sense to me."" [Laughter] And then he gets on to judiciary and things that, frankly, he likes and finds very interesting. But he's a smart guy, and he said -- I'll never forget. It took me about a minute, which is a long time."
00:46:14 - 00:46:34 (21 sec),"I did a bad description. It's so easy. They charge 100; we charge nothing. Now we have reciprocal, so it's 100. But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and don't like tariffs for whatever reason might be -- and that's okay. What's going to happen is, in many cases, instead of 100 and 100, you're going to have zero and zero, so you won't have any tariff."
00:46:34 - 00:46:56 (21 sec),"Okay? It's going to happen. That's going to happen. But you have to -- you have to start working on some of the senators that say ""I can't approve this deal."" I say, ""You know what? I want to just charge India"" -- as an example, I'm using it. But India is a very high-tariff nation. I mean, nobody -- nobody knows it because nobody knows what they're doing in Washington."
00:46:56 - 00:47:20 (24 sec),"[Laughter] But India is a very, very high-tariff nation, and they charge tremendous -- tremendous numbers. So they charge 100. So I say, ""I'm not going to charge 100, but I'm going to charge 25 percent."" And I hear this turmoil in the Senate because we're charging 25. So I call a couple of the guys up. I say, ""Fellas, listen, they're charging us 100 for the exact same product."
00:47:20 - 00:47:45 (25 sec),"I want to charge them 25."" And I feel so foolish charging 25 because it should be 100. ""But I'm doing 25 only because of you. I want to get your support."" ""Sir, that's not free trade."" Where do these people come from? [Laughter] Where do they come from? Where? Where do they come from? I need your help. I need your help -- the voters' help."
00:47:45 - 00:48:17 (32 sec),"Where do they come from? So it can only be one of two or three things. Number one, I know they're very smart people. I know they are. And I even like some of them. [Laughter] But they're smart. So we take that out of the equation. So even -- and I know they don't have evil intentions. And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe -- you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous."
00:48:17 - 00:48:49 (32 sec),"Campaign contributions -- they're very, very generous people. Can that be possible? I don't think so. I hope not. Because we're talking about our country. We can't allow a country to charge 100 percent and we get nothing for the same exact product. For one thing, they don't respect us. They think we're ""stupido."" They don't respect us. [Laughter] But let me tell you something: The world respects our country again."
00:48:49 - 00:49:39 (50 sec),"They respect us. And America is now booming like never before. Other countries are doing very poorly. Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful. Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the Fed. We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed. We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the Fed. So with all of those things -- and we want a strong dollar, but let's be reasonable."
00:49:39 - 00:50:00 (21 sec),"You understand that. With all of that, we're doing great. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? There's no inflation, essentially. There's no inflation. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? If we didn't do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market?"
00:50:00 - 00:50:38 (38 sec),"If we didn't do quantitative -- and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar. A little bit. I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's going to be great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business. Since the election, we've created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy."
00:50:38 - 00:51:20 (42 sec),"5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country. These are jobs that were never coming back to our country. Remember? Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked Hillary winning the election, instead of being up almost 50 percent with the stock market, you would have been down 50 percent."
00:51:20 - 00:52:00 (40 sec),"It was heading down. It was going to be a disaster. We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps. Nobody ever thought that was possible. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years. And African American -- and you've heard me say this many times -- Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows."
00:52:00 - 00:52:41 (41 sec),"And African American income has reached an all-time high. So when I'm on the debate stage with one of these maniacs -- [Laughter] -- I mean, trains to Hawaii. ""How do you get to Europe?"" ""We haven't figured that one out yet. We don't use airplanes anymore."" [Laughter] You saw what I'm doing in California, right?"
00:52:41 - 00:53:03 (22 sec),"They have a fast train. The fast train goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It's over budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, so they have a great idea -- the new governor; nice guy. Yeah, he's a nice guy. When I'm with him face to face, nice. When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me. [Laughter] He called me up. He said, ""You're a great President."
00:53:03 - 00:53:30 (27 sec),"You're doing a great job."" He actually did, two weeks ago, three weeks. So he'll probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House. Everybody else does. [Laughter] Check them. Check them. Check them. Called me up three or four weeks ago. I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that's one of the problems they have."
00:53:30 - 00:53:47 (17 sec),"I said, ""You got to get those forests."" We can't keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly. Got to clean it up. It's called management. When a tree falls, you can't let the environmentalist say you can't take that tree out. It becomes like a matchstick, that tree."
00:53:47 - 00:54:16 (29 sec),"It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves -- every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so -- a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it. The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed. You got to have management. But he called me up the other day, recently -- let's say four weeks ago or so. He said, ""I just want to tell you you're a great President and you're one of the smartest people I've ever met."" That's what he said."
00:54:16 - 00:54:35 (19 sec),"Now, that's what he said. Will he admit it? No, I doubt it. [Laughter] But that's what he said. ""And you're doing a great job."" And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is -- [Laughter] -- it's okay. That's okay. We have great talks. I mean, I like him. Gavin Newsom."
00:54:35 - 00:55:02 (27 sec),"I like him. Nice guy. But they say things -- you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see two days later they're giving a news conference -- just like, where did that guy come from? Where did he come from? But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well -- except, of course, for the Never Trumpers."
00:55:02 - 00:55:43 (41 sec),"But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. [Laughter] Mouth to mouth. Mouth to mouth. They're hanging in. A couple of them. I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong. Not only Never Trumpers. You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline. They're basically dishonest people -- because, look, let's face it: Whether you like me or not -- if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges -- it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges."
00:55:43 - 00:56:19 (36 sec),"And 17 appellate division judges. That we've got the best economy maybe in our history. That we've got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history. That we've cut more regulations in two years than any President has ever done, whether it's for eight or beyond. That we've taken care of our military with -- $1.7 billion."
00:56:19 - 00:56:39 (20 sec),"Think of that. Think of what we did. Think of what we did with our military. Think of the numbers that we have for our military. We have numbers -- nobody has ever heard of these numbers before. And you know, part of the problem that we have -- because I'm a cost cutter. But -- and you are all cost cutters."
00:56:39 - 00:57:07 (28 sec),"But we have to take care of our military. We have to. Seven hundred billions dollars we spent. And that was the first year. And then the second year, $716 billion. Now, I have no choice. I'd like to spend much less. Obama was spending much less but our military was being depleted. He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end."
00:57:07 - 00:57:33 (26 sec),"And, by the way, as of probably today or tomorrow, we will actually have 100 percent of the caliphate in Syria. One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And we'll leave a small group of guys and gals. But we want to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. It's time."
00:57:33 - 00:58:24 (51 sec),"Been in these wars. We were going to be in Syria for four months. We ended up five years. This fighting -- they just like to fight. We want to fix our country. We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools. We want to fix our country up. It's time. It's time. But I was told by a general, who I had to fire -- I said, ""General, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate?"" He said, ""Sir, two years."" I said, ""I can't take it two years."" And then I flew to Iraq; first time I left the White House -- because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places."
00:58:24 - 00:58:40 (16 sec),"[Laughter] And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay? I figured it would look good. [Laughter] I figured it would look good. So I stayed in the White House. And I'll tell you what: I was there -- I told my wife, ""Go to Florida."
00:58:40 - 00:59:01 (21 sec),"Enjoy your Christmas."" I stayed for Thanksgiving. I said -- I mean, I was in the White House for a long time. Months. Months. I had cabin fever in the White House. [Laughter] But if you've got to have cabin fever, that's the place to do it, okay? [Laughter] But I was there, I don't know, for a number of months, through Christmas."
00:59:01 - 00:59:05 (4 sec),"I spent my New Year's all by myself. [Laughter, Audience calls out Awww]"
00:59:05 - 00:59:35 (29 sec),"Don't cry. All -- it was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns. [Laughter] I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns. I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, ""Man..."" They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn. I told people, ""I'm in this mess"" -- you know, people don't know how big the White House."
00:59:35 - 00:59:54 (20 sec),"First of all, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world. It's really -- I made a lot of money with luxury. This building is -- 1799 -- which, of course, when President Xi comes, I say ""1799,"" like it's old. To him, that's like a brand-new house in China. [Laughter] In China, they go back -- they go back 8,000 years."
00:59:54 - 01:00:29 (35 sec),"So that's -- that's like a new -- that's like a new residence. But I sat in the White House for months and months, except I took a day off. I flew to a lovely place called Iraq, and I flew at night and I got there at night. And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, ""Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off."" I say, ""Why?"" [Laughter] ""Because we're getting ready to land."" We're an hour out."
01:00:29 - 01:00:46 (18 sec),"I said, ""What about the shades?"" ""Well, we want it better than that. May be like [Inaudible]. So we turned the lights off, put the shades down. This is a big seven forty -- Air Force One. And we're landing, and I go up and I look. And I've landed; I like to sit with pilots. I respect people that know what they're doing, and these are the best in the world."
01:00:46 - 01:01:11 (25 sec),"I really do. These are the best in the world. And the pilot says, ""Sir, we're landing in approximately one and a half minutes."" I say, ""But there's no runway."" ""No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir."" I say, ""I don't see it."" I have pretty good vision. [Laughter] At least for my age I have good vision."
01:01:11 - 01:01:30 (19 sec),"[Laughter] I guess for my age I have great vision. But I donât have vision like a 35-year-old captain. He said, ""No, it's right up there."" I said, ""I'm sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again? Captain, there's no runway."" Anyway -- he sits right up there and we land. There's practically not lights."
01:01:30 - 01:02:00 (29 sec),"These are little pin spots. And I said, think of this: We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we can't land with the lights on -- [Laughter] -- 20 years later. How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights. But I met some incredible people."
01:02:00 - 01:02:24 (24 sec),I met some incredible people -- generals. One of them came from Syria -- the operation in Syria. And I was upset with my generals because they weren't getting it finished. I want the job done. I want to bring our people back home. It's not fair. And this is why I flew. So I met generals I didn't know.
01:02:24 - 01:02:48 (24 sec),"General one, general two, general three. I mean, these generals -- there's no person in Hollywood that could play the role. These guys are like perfect people. I said, ""What's your name? ""Sir, my name is Raisin."" What the hell kind of a name? [Laughter] I said, ""Raisin, like the fruit?"" He goes, ""Yes, sir, Raisin."" ""What's your last name?"" ""Caine."
01:02:48 - 01:03:12 (24 sec),"Raisin Caine."" [Laughter] I said, ""You got to be kidding me."" It's true. Raisin Caine. I just made him a big star. [Laughter] Just like I did with Mattis when I said, ""We're going to give you a new nickname, because 'Chaos' is not a good nickname."" So we changed his name. Called him ""Mad Dog."" But it wasnât working too well."
01:03:12 - 01:03:28 (16 sec),"Mad Dog wasn't working too well. So what happened is I flew to Iraq. I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what's going on, than I do from generals. I do. I hate to say it. And I tell that to the generals all the time. But I didn't have to go there."
01:03:28 - 01:03:47 (19 sec),"I didn't have to go there. Because I meet -- and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing. We must have spent $3 billion building it. It's one of the reasons I don't want to leave Iraq so fast. I said, ""Well, how do we leave this thing?"" So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants."
01:03:47 - 01:04:10 (23 sec),"And I said, ""Bring the cameras. I'm going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing."" [Laughter] And I said to the generals, ""Listen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left."" ""It won't, sir."" And I said, ""Tell me why it won't."" ""It won't, sir."
01:04:10 - 01:04:49 (39 sec),"If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster."" ""Okay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can"" -- ""Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week."" I said, ""One week? I was told two years."" [Laughter] One week? ""That's right, sir. We're only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over -- from the base that you're right on, right now, sir."
01:04:49 - 01:05:08 (19 sec),"They won't know what the hell hit them."" ""They won't know what the hell hit them, sir."" And I said, ""Why didn't my other generals tell me that? Why didn't they tell me that?"" I said, ""Did you tell them that?"" ""Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders."
01:05:08 - 01:05:36 (28 sec),"You're the first one to ask us our opinion."" It's true. It's true. True. True. So I went back and I said, ""I'm going to get back to you soon, Raisin. I think you're great."" [Laughter] ""I like you, Raisin Caine."" But I did say -- I said, ""Well, hey, listen, we're in Iraq. Isn't that very far away from..."" ""I was here in a very short time, sir."
01:05:36 - 01:06:00 (24 sec),"I flew right in."" Of course, he's taking a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, you know. But incredible. What you learn from being on the site -- my father was a builder. He always used to say, ""Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk."" It's true. It's true. He'd say, ""You got to be on this site."
01:06:00 - 01:06:18 (18 sec),"You got to be with the contractors. You got to see if they're ripping you off. You've got to collect every nail that's dropped, every piece of wood. You can sell it. You got to be on the site. You got to see while they're building, while they're under construction, is that wall straight or if it's crooked."
01:06:18 - 01:06:40 (22 sec),"And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down."" True. You donât get rich by sitting behind a desk. So I didn't want to do that. And I'm in the White House and I was lonely. I said, ""Let's go to Iraq."" [Laughter] And I had a hell of a meeting in Iraq."
01:06:40 - 01:07:09 (29 sec),"And I'll tell you, those generals -- not just Raisin Caine, General Caine. Those generals were great. They were great. They knew their stuff. They were gung-ho. And it is true -- I mean, you talk central casting. These guys -- you couldnât -- I mean, it's incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he's the star of the movie."
01:07:09 - 01:07:38 (29 sec),"That happened once before, you know. That did happen once before. Remember? They brought a man in -- a sergeant, a drill sergeant -- to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant. The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn't. That's because Hollywood discriminates against our people."
01:07:38 - 01:08:12 (34 sec),"You know the movie I'm talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie. But while we're making great strides, and our country is doing as well -- and maybe, in many ways, better than it's ever done before -- Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism. They want to replace individual rights with total government domination. [Audience Boos]"
01:08:12 - 01:08:35 (23 sec),"Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American healthcare. Their radical government-run plan -- if you call it that -- would lead to colossal tax increases -- increases like you've never seen before -- and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans. [Audience calls out No]"
01:08:35 - 01:09:16 (41 sec),"And we have some great private coverage, and we've initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost. But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal. [Audience Boos]"
01:09:16 - 01:09:55 (39 sec),"Under the Green New Deal -- which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student -- [Laughter] -- it's true. It's true. Who would believe it? It so -- it's so bad. But I don't -- I'll be honest with you, folks. I said -- you know, it's Saturday morning, and I said, ""Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time?"" He said, ""Yeah, would you do that?"" By the way, everybody okay?"
01:09:55 - 01:10:20 (25 sec),"I haven't seen anybody leaving. I haven't seen anybody. I know one thing: If Mark Levin gets up and leaves, I'll finish very quickly, because then I know. [Laughter] But I haven't seen anyone leaving. Nobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times -- a lot of times -- well, one time, the press said people left."
01:10:20 - 01:10:46 (27 sec),"Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back. [Laughter] Two people. They showed two empty seats in a stadium of 19,000. They showed two empty seats. The people left right in front of me, and I said, ""Oh, man, maybe this isn't a good job I'm doing."" Then they came back."
01:10:46 - 01:11:15 (28 sec),"They went to the bathroom. [Laughter] And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats. The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we're now the leader in the world."
01:11:15 - 01:11:40 (26 sec),"We're the biggest now in the world because of moves that I've made. Happened over the last two years, by the way. And we're trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years. We think we're almost very close to getting them approved. When that happens, we'll go probably another 30 to 40 percent."
01:11:40 - 01:12:13 (33 sec),"We need pipeline approval. We're going to have it very quickly. It would have taken -- it was going to be a 14- to 15-year process. We should have it done. We'll pick up 30 to 40 percent more. Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads. Oh, that's not so bad. They want you to have one car instead of two, and it should be electric, okay?"
01:12:13 - 01:12:35 (22 sec),"So tell people, no more cars. No more cars. I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan. What do you think, Meadows? How is this? Will the auto industry be good? I donât think so. It's not looking good. I think maybe -- maybe you're going to see some bad stock prices if that passes."
01:12:35 - 01:13:01 (26 sec),"It would end air travel. But you'll get on a train, don't worry about it. You just have to cross off about 95 percent of the world. And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States. New York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again."
01:13:01 - 01:13:27 (26 sec),"I don't think so. This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for 20 years -- white hair. See, I don't have white hair. [Laughter] I donât have white hair. No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she's ranting and raving like a lunatic. [Laughter]"
01:13:27 - 01:14:01 (35 sec),"And these senators -- these senators: ""Yes, I agree with this. Yes, I agree."" The crazy female senator from the state of Ohio, the state of Hawaii. Right? She's like -- she's like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad. But she's standing in the hallway."
01:14:01 - 01:14:39 (38 sec),"And she didn't know too much about the plan because she's -- you know, she can't understand that plan. [Laughter] Which probably makes her smart, actually. Now, this is the senator from Hawaii, and they're saying to her, ""What do you think? Well, I don't know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I'm in favor of the plan."" [Laughter] I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. So she's in favor of the plan, but you won't be able to get to -- well, we can take boats, I guess."
01:14:39 - 01:15:10 (30 sec),We'll go back to boats. This is the new Democrat platform for the -- and I don't want to talk them out of it. I don't. I don't. I swear I don't. This is a killer. I got to get off this subject. I want them to embrace this plan. I want them to go and sell this plan. I just want to be the Republican that runs against them for that.
01:15:10 - 01:15:40 (30 sec),"I'm going to regret this speech. This speech should have been delivered one year from now, not now, damn it. [Laughter] Because they're going to grab out together, and they're going to say, ""You know, this guy is really laying for us."" I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year. [Laughter] Because I've destroyed her political career, and now I won't get a chance to run against her, and I wouldâve loved it. [Laughter] We got to -- you know, I don't want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that's actually got talent."
01:15:40 - 01:15:58 (19 sec),That would be terrible. [Laughter] So I do like the Green New Deal. [Laughter] I respect it greatly. It should be part of the dialogue of the next election. [Laughter] And I think it has tremendous promise and tremendous potential for the future of our country. Socialism is not about the environment.
01:15:58 - 01:16:17 (19 sec),"It's not about justice. It's not about virtue. Socialism is about only one thing. It's called ""power for the ruling class."" That's what it is. Look at what's happening in Venezuela and so many other places. All of us are here today because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism."
01:16:17 - 01:16:57 (40 sec),"And I heard, yesterday, a great speech from our Vice President Mike Pence, talking about this very subject -- and talking about it beautifully. The future belongs to those who believe in freedom. I have said it before and I'll say it again: America will never be a socialist country -- ever."
01:16:57 - 01:16:57 (0 sec),[Audience Chants USA]
01:16:57 - 01:17:09 (12 sec),"Young Americans -- I love young Americans. Speaking of young Americans -- Candace, stand up. Candace is getting married. Stand up. You've been incredible. Thank you. Your whole group has been great. You're getting married. Seems like a nice guy to me. [Laughter] Congratulations. You've been so great."
01:17:09 - 01:17:41 (32 sec),"Thank you very much, Candace. Thanks. And, Charlie, what a job you're doing. Where's Charlie? Where's Charlie? Where is Charlie Kirk? Because he has done an incredible job. Thank you very much, Charlie. But young Americans like you are leading the revival of American liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance."
01:17:41 - 01:18:21 (40 sec),"The anger -- the unbelievable anger -- I see it every day. Fortunately, for you, it's mostly pointed at me. [Laughter] You have the courage to speak the truth, to do what is right, and to fight for what you believe, and keep doing it. We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas."
01:18:21 - 01:18:57 (36 sec),"These ideas are dangerous. Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus. And, by the way, there's a young gentleman with us today. There's a young gentleman. I turned on my television the other day, and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face."
01:18:57 - 01:19:36 (39 sec),"Violently punched. And I said that's disgusting. By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things. But, of course, we would never do that. Because if I ever said violence, they would say, ""Donald Trump attacked."" No, no, no. Just for the media: I'm sure he's a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum."
01:19:36 - 01:20:09 (33 sec),"[Laughter] I've been there before with those people. I donât want to do it again. So, the man's name is Hayden Williams. Where's Hayden? Where is he? Where is he? Hayden, come up here. Come up here."
01:20:09 - 01:20:29 (19 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. So, at the Leadership Institute, we're committed to making campuses great again. And I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak. It's great -- it's great that I'm being recognized, and -- but there's so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse, if they dare to speak up on campus."
01:20:29 - 01:20:58 (29 sec),"So I'm glad that we could -- we could, you know, bring this to the forefront. And I'd just like to say, you know, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat. So, you know, it's as important now than ever the work at Leadership Institute and Campus Reform -- you know, exposing these liberal abuses to the public -- it's as important now as ever."
01:20:58 - 01:21:10 (12 sec),"And these students -- these students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom, and frankly, a love for you, Mr. President. So if you keep defending us, we'll keep defending you."
01:21:10 - 01:21:16 (5 sec),Thank you.
01:21:16 - 01:21:16 (1 sec),Thank you.
01:21:16 - 01:21:35 (19 sec),"Stay here for a second. So, here's the one thing. I was going to call him, but I don't have to now. I see him here. But here's the one thing: I learned a number of things. First of all, he can take a punch. If Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take a punch. [Laughter] Because you werenât going to go down no matter how -- that was a hell of a hard punch."
01:21:35 - 01:22:11 (36 sec),"He was a strong guy. But you know what? You've got yourself a great lawyer. I know your lawyer. She is a great lawyer. Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him. But he's probably got nothing, but sue him forever. But sue the college, the university. And maybe sue the state. Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us. Remember that."
01:22:11 - 01:22:52 (41 sec),"He took a punch for all of us. And we can never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden -- here's the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man. That's okay. [Laughter] Go get 'em, Hayden. Today I'm proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech -- if they want federal research dollars. [Audience Chants USA]"
01:22:52 - 01:23:57 (65 sec),"If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people, and old people, to speak. Free speech. And if they don't, it will be very costly. That'll be signed very soon. Every day, we're restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all."
01:23:57 - 01:24:22 (25 sec),"We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right. And we believe in religious liberty. And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms -- which is under siege, folks. They have a lot of plans. It's under siege."
01:24:22 - 01:25:17 (55 sec),"Be careful. But I'll protect you, I promise you that. I'll protect you. Because it all has to come through my office. And we hopefully are going to be here for six more years, so you're in good shape. We believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare. And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust."
01:25:17 - 01:25:59 (42 sec),"Every day, my presidency will defend American families. We will defend America's workers -- our great, great cherished workers -- that now we're taking care of. They're not losing their jobs. We're creating those jobs. We're not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore. We will defend the American way of life, and we will always defend America's borders."
01:25:59 - 01:26:39 (40 sec),"Because without borders, as I've said many times before, we don't have a country. The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet. Deadly cartels constantly -- daily, hourly -- violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill thousands and thousands of our citizens violently."
01:26:39 - 01:27:10 (30 sec),"What are these people talking about when they talk about the border? ""Keep it open."" Keep what open? Have you been there? Have you seen? I just got back. I've been there many times. I see what's happening. I don't like it. But I have to tell you, our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our law enforcement, the job they do -- and they don't have the backup of a wall, in many cases -- the job they do is incredible."
01:27:10 - 01:27:39 (29 sec),"These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere. When I was there two weeks ago, 26 people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande. Sounds nice, right? The Rio Grande. Rough. Rough stuff. Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing."
01:27:39 - 01:28:07 (28 sec),"And the paper doesn't write about it. The news doesn't write about it. In the last two years alone, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests. Think of what that means. Think of that -- arrests. I'm not talking about people coming in. I'm talking they went out and arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder."
01:28:07 - 01:28:37 (30 sec),"Who the hell wants to do that? Thank God they're doing it because I don't want to do it. It's dangerous. It's hard. But they love our country, and they're tough people, but they love our country. Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders."
01:28:37 - 01:28:55 (19 sec),"These are people that ICE is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we donât want them. We don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years. You want them to pay a price, but we don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years."
01:28:55 - 01:29:23 (27 sec),"And all the nonsense you hear about ""the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have"" -- it's not true, folks. Okay? It's false. It's false propaganda. Right? One recent study from FAIR -- F-A-I-R -- found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents."
01:29:23 - 01:29:45 (23 sec),"Those are the numbers. And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are -- the number is staggering. The number of illegals -- far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population. But you don't hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world."
01:29:45 - 01:30:16 (30 sec),Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there. Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly -- so badly. Incredible people. But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place. The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy.
01:30:16 - 01:30:49 (33 sec),"Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word ""rape."" The press went after me; I couldn't believe it. I said, ""Will it be like this always?"" The answer was yes."
01:30:49 - 01:31:45 (56 sec),"It even got worse. From day one, I mention the word ""rape."" If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what's really happening. That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts. Illegal immigration is not compassionate. It's inhumane, unjust, and cruel. The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that 2,000-mile trek up through Mexico -- and frankly, I wish Mexico would stop them at their northern border, at our -- I wish Mexico would stop them."
01:31:45 - 01:32:09 (24 sec),"Because you know, they have a border. They call it their southern border. It's 2,000 miles down from our southern border. I wish Mexico would stop them. But they have their own difficulties. Frankly, I understand that. We're working along well with them. And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we're doing."
01:32:09 - 01:32:42 (32 sec),"But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border. Think of that. True story, told to me by the Border Patrol. So true and so sad. Think of how evil that is. Think of how bad it is. Those caravans -- you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people."
01:32:42 - 01:33:14 (32 sec),"But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers. You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now. ""And what is it that you want asylum for? Why are you coming to America?"" ""Uh, murder."" She goes, ""What?"" ""Murder."" I mean, what's going on is incredible. And when those caravans are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to -- I've cut it way back."
01:33:14 - 01:33:39 (25 sec),"I've cut it way back. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Do you think they're giving us, as we say, their best and their finest? ""Oh, let's send our best people up to America. Let's have our best people go in the caravan so we can give America our greatest people."" No, no, no, no. They give us some very bad people."
01:33:39 - 01:34:14 (35 sec),"People with big, long crime records. People with tremendous violence in their past. Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers. They want to keep their good people because they're smart. It's so sad to see how stupid we've been. Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago."
01:34:14 - 01:34:50 (36 sec),"Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, last month I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people -- and they're good people -- some senators, mostly -- I tell you, the House has been fantastic."
01:34:50 - 01:35:04 (14 sec),"The House -- you know, backing we've had from the House has really been -- I'm talking about in the last short period of time. There's a lot of spirit in the House, and I think in the Senate too, but we're going to have to see because we have a vote coming up. And a lot of people talk about precedent. Precedent."
01:35:04 - 01:35:28 (24 sec),"That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we don't want. They're going to do that anyway, folks. The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election. That's the best way to stop that. They're going to do it anyway. They'll do it anyway."
01:35:28 - 01:35:53 (25 sec),"I watch -- good people, they're friends of mine, ""We're very concerned with setting precedent."" That's ""precedent"" not ""president."" [Laughter] Precedent. ""We're very concerned about setting precedent."" I'm very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country."
01:35:53 - 01:36:16 (23 sec),"That's what I'm concerned about. And the Democrats, they're going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it won't have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency. Because let me tell you -- they don't like it when I say it -- but we are being invaded. We're being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals."
01:36:16 - 01:36:47 (31 sec),"And we have to stop it. And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit. Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in Belarus, to ensure political stability in Burundi, and to defend the sovereignty of Lebanon."
01:36:47 - 01:37:13 (27 sec),"And you know what? That's okay. In Lebanon -- it's good. Fine. Use it. But we need it right here in our country. We have to use it for our country. Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands. Now we are protecting, finally, our people. You. Our people."
01:37:13 - 01:37:48 (34 sec),"And we are proudly standing with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants. If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border."
01:37:48 - 01:38:16 (28 sec),"We need an immigration policy that helps all Americans thrive, flourish, prosper. We need an immigration policy that's going to be great for our corporations and our great companies. We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens. And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities."
01:38:16 - 01:38:31 (15 sec),"And we want to end catch-and-release. We catch them, we realize they're a criminal, and we have to release them. Think of this: They come onto our land, they put one foot on our land. We now have to take them through a massive court trial. Who does this? Other countries say, ""Get the hell out of here."" We have to take them through court."
01:38:31 - 01:39:08 (37 sec),"So we catch them. We talk to them. If they're criminals, or if they're not, we release them. We say, ""Come back for a hearing in front of a judge."" You know how many judges you need to do this? We have 900,000 people backlogged. That's the good news. The bad news? Nobody shows up. Three percent of the people come back for a trial."
01:39:08 - 01:39:38 (30 sec),"It's insane. Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it. We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery. Every American, no matter where they're born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system. It is such -- you talk about an emergency. Our immigration system is so broken, folks."
01:39:38 - 01:40:07 (29 sec),"It's so broken. It's so sad to see. It's incompetent. It's laughed at all over the world. We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in Mexico. From China. They have a baby on our land. The baby becomes a citizen. ""Welcome to the United States"" for hopefully 90 years. Okay? And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen."
01:40:07 - 01:40:43 (36 sec),"This is like crazy. They used to call it ""anchor babies"" but they don't use that term anymore because it doesn't sound nice. Our laws are so crazy. But one by one, we're finding ways. You know, they call them loopholes. A lot of our laws -- loopholes. Well, I'm finding loopholes to get around the loophole."
01:40:43 - 01:41:17 (34 sec),"Okay? [Laughter] Because our Congress can't act. They can't act. They just can't act. The Democrats in Congress don't want to touch any of it. Visa lottery -- that's where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, ""Oh, here's a wonderful person. Wonderful."" You know, he killed four people."
01:41:17 - 01:41:41 (24 sec),"Here's -- here's another wonderful. [Laughter] And then they get in and we say, ""Gee, that person just came into our country. He just robbed a store and killed somebody."" How is that possible? Because they send us the people they don't want. The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations."
01:41:41 - 01:42:03 (22 sec),"Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute. We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves. We have people coming in. We support them from the day they come in until the day they die. We can't do that as a country."
01:42:03 - 01:42:26 (23 sec),"We can't afford to do that as a country. Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream. But that's going to be good for us in 2020. They're embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion. [Audience Boos]"
01:42:26 - 01:42:56 (30 sec),"Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death. Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I don't think I've ever heard, in Virginia, the governor -- a Democrat -- stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside."
01:42:56 - 01:43:13 (17 sec),"He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he'll talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done. And if they didn't want the child, who is now outside of the womb -- long outside of the womb -- they will execute the baby after birth. [Audience Boos]"
01:43:13 - 01:43:43 (31 sec),"They will execute the baby after birth. And that's one many people have never even heard of or thought about. This is a radical agenda by the Democrats. And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it. By the way, I have to say one thing: They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy."
01:43:43 - 01:44:12 (29 sec),They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to. But -- but -- big but -- they always stick together. And the Republicans don't remember that. Remember that. They always stick together. They vote in blocs. They have 47. We had a tremendous victory. We were given no credit. I can't go and campaign for all of the people in the House.
01:44:12 - 01:44:46 (34 sec),"Too many. And guys like Meadows wins by so many points he doesn't need any help. He doesn't need it. I say, ""Mark, do you need any help?"" ""No, I'm okay."" [Laughter] He'll win by 30, 35. They're okay. These guys -- you know a funny thing? The ones that love Trump, the ones that are really the Trumpers -- like Meadows, Jordan, Gates, so many of them."
01:44:46 - 01:45:06 (20 sec),"I donât want to -- I could just name so many. They're the ones that win with that. I mean, it's like they don't even have an election. It's the ones that sort of -- they're a little shy about embracing what we're all about, they get clobbered. They get clobbered. Take a look. Those are the ones that get clobbered."
01:45:06 - 01:45:31 (26 sec),"But the good news is they're all starting to find that out. Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions. Virtually every Democrat voted against protecting these precious babies. Every one. They vote in groups. And we did have that great victory."
01:45:31 - 01:45:56 (25 sec),"We won for 51. And two that we didn't like got out. They said they retired. They didn't retire. They were retired. They said, ""These two senators have decided to retire."" No, no, no. They retired because they had like very little support. Like how about 5 percent? Any percent. No, we did great."
01:45:56 - 01:46:42 (46 sec),"We had 53 we picked up in the Senate. They were going to win the Senate, remember? And I'll tell you, folks, I worked hard. I did 32 big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals. And the fake news back there, they love to say ""Donald Trump suffered a big defeat."" First of all, we won the Senate, which, frankly, judges -- you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the Senate, far more important."
01:46:42 - 01:47:12 (30 sec),"I really worked hard. But think of it. We won the Senate and we had this, like, tremendous victory. We get no credit at all. Wait until you see what happens. They say, ""Donald Trump suffered a humiliating defeat."" I said, ""I wasn't running."" [Laughter] And one of the commentators -- and I appreciate it -- one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, ""Excuse me, he didn't run."" You know, not all our candidates were exactly great."
01:47:12 - 01:47:38 (26 sec),"Let's face it. You know, you can only do so much. But wait until you see what's happening when I do run. And what they don't say is -- governor of Ohio, great guy. Mike. Mike. Mike was down six. He won by seven with one day. Right? He was down by six. One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech."
01:47:38 - 01:48:01 (23 sec),Jim Jordan was there. Everybody was there. It was a fantastic crowd like this. Like this. And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us. And he ended up winning. He was down by six; he won by seven. One day. Then we have Georgia -- the governor of Georgia. Great guy. Where's Georgia?
01:48:01 - 01:48:25 (25 sec),"Great guy. He was losing in the primary by 10. I got a call from David Perdue and Sonny Perdue -- two great guys. ""Could you endorse him?"" I said, ""Let me check."" And I checked him. He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper. [Laughter] And I said, ""I love this guy."" He's down by 10. He won by 40. Can you believe that?"
01:48:25 - 01:48:46 (21 sec),"I endorsed him, Mark. He won by 40. Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party -- not Democratic. It's Democrat. We have to do that. You know, it sounds prettier when we use ""Democratic."" I even like -- I hate to say in the speech, the ""Democrat Party"" because it doesn't sound good."
01:48:46 - 01:49:11 (25 sec),"But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't. [Laughter] They should change it because it sounds much better. Rhetorically, it's much better. Much better. But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address. I didn't think she was great. But she's their star."
01:49:11 - 01:49:18 (7 sec),"And who showed up? Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and President Obama. [Audience Boos]"
01:49:18 - 01:50:03 (45 sec),"And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard. And all our man had was Trump. [Laughter] And we kicked their ass. True. We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport. It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back. The problem was they gave the press, like these guys -- they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them couldn't see properly."
01:50:03 - 01:50:35 (33 sec),"I was so angry. But we had 55,000 people show up. I said, ""You're going to win the election."" He won the election. He won it fairly easily, against their star. And now David Perdue is going to win for senator in 2020. And then -- and then we had Florida, and many others. And we have a candidate, Ron DeSantis -- a friend."
01:50:35 - 01:50:57 (21 sec),"A friend of many of us in this room. But nobody knew he was running. He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win. He was scheduled to be the next governor of Florida. But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt. He's been a defender of me against these phony charges of Russia."
01:50:57 - 01:51:16 (19 sec),"Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. My wife said, ""You never spoke to anybody from Russia, darling."" I said, ""That's right."" [Laughter] But Ron DeSantis -- I like people that defend me. You know, when people defend me, I defend them. So he came. That's why I like Mark. That's why I like Mark Levin."
01:51:16 - 01:51:41 (26 sec),"And I'm not sure a lot of people like him. He's tough as hell. But I like him. I love him. But then we have Florida. So, Ron DeSantis is at three. Three. He calls up, ""Sir, can I have your endorsement?"" I said, ""Ron, you're at three. Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner -- has 22 million in the bank."
01:51:41 - 01:52:03 (22 sec),"His poll numbers are very good. He's up in the 20s or 30s."" I said, ""Ron, don't make me do this, Ron."" [Laughter] ""Sir, I can win."" ""All right, Ron. Here we go."" Because I know if he loses -- which almost never happens when I endorse somebody. Almost never. Only one time, and that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election."
01:52:03 - 01:52:29 (26 sec),"Nobody knew I did it. They got home, they said, ""I didn't know Trump endorsed him."" But we rarely, rarely lose. But I said, ""Ron, don't do it."" I said, ""All right, I'll do it."" He went from 3 to 60. To 60. And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support. He had every celebrity go into Florida."
01:52:29 - 01:52:55 (26 sec),"He had money all over the place. And Ron was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him. And we now have a great governor in the state of Florida. And I could mention many others -- other governors, many other states. But I'm not going to bore you with it. And I think -- I really think that it's incredible what we did in the midterms."
01:52:55 - 01:53:20 (26 sec),"I think it's incredible. Governor of Florida. Governor of Ohio. Remember, ""You can't win unless you win the state of Ohio."" We got the governor of Ohio, and he's great. Mike. We love you, Mike. As we defend American values at home, we are also defending. American security abroad. We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything."
01:53:20 - 01:53:46 (26 sec),"And we will never forget our military. We will never forget our veterans. We are taking care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor. Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks."
01:53:46 - 01:54:17 (31 sec),And we got them Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists. You had people that took advantage of our veterans. They've hit them. They were sadists. They were sick people. You couldnât fire them. You had thieves that were stealing -- openly stealing. You couldn't fire them. I got a bill passed: VA Accountability.
01:54:17 - 01:54:36 (20 sec),"Now you look at the guy, you say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired. Get out."" Nobody thought we could get it. For 40 years they tried to get it. For 40 years they tried to get it; they couldn't get it. And VA Choice, they thought -- for many, many decades they'd been trying to get VA Choice."
01:54:36 - 01:55:02 (26 sec),"You couldnât get it. Now, instead of waiting on line for two days, nine days, three weeks -- people were dying. People that weren't very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later. Now these great veterans, if there's a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor. We pay the bills."
01:55:02 - 01:55:33 (30 sec),"They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved -- for our veterans. We love our veterans. And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from Vietnam, where I had very productive meetings with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Very productive."
01:55:33 - 01:55:50 (17 sec),"We get along. We've developed a good relationship -- very good -- and made great historic progress. And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: ""Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that."" You know, they're telling me how to negotiate."
01:55:50 - 01:56:11 (21 sec),"These guys died. One administration gave billions of dollars to him and got nothing. And we haven't given him anything yet. I look forward to maybe doing something at some point. But I know one thing: I'm going to get other countries to give. Maybe not us, but I'm going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out."
01:56:11 - 01:56:42 (31 sec),"If it all works out. But I had to walk. Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal wasn't a deal that was acceptable to me. I don't like these deals that politicians make. They make a deal just for the sake of doing it. I don't want to do that. I want to make a deal that either works, or let's not make it. But the one thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up. No nuclear testing."
01:56:42 - 01:57:07 (25 sec),"We got our great people back. We get our great, great people. And that includes our beautiful, beautiful Otto -- Otto Warmbier -- whose parents I've gotten to know, who's incredible. And I'm in such a horrible position, because in one way I have to negotiate. In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto."
01:57:07 - 01:57:41 (34 sec),"And it's a very, very delicate balance. He was a special young man. And to see what happened was so bad. It was so bad. And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea, and any success that we hopefully have -- and we've had a lot. We're given no credit. They don't remember that, in the last days of the Obama administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on. Mountains were being -- these are big mountains."
01:57:41 - 01:58:01 (20 sec),"They were being shoved over three, four inches. People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons -- nuclear testing. So much. We're getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from many, many years ago. Mike Pence was in Hawaii. It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies."
01:58:01 - 01:58:22 (21 sec),"We've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to make progress. And I really think what we're doing there is very important. But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting. In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front."
01:58:22 - 01:58:43 (20 sec),"But you see, that's not what happened there. So already, I think we're negotiating. And I'll tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal. But they don't have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons. It's really a bad thing for them. So we'll see how it all goes."
01:58:43 - 01:59:06 (23 sec),"But I think it's going well. I think we learned a lot over the last couple of days. And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong. And that's an important thing, especially when we're dealing with this kind of a situation. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
01:59:06 - 01:59:32 (26 sec),"You saw that. Would you like to apologize? No. I'm not apologizing. Now you have a President who is standing up for America. After decades of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with American hands, American grit, and with beautiful, beautiful American steel."
01:59:32 - 02:00:05 (33 sec),"We are fighting to ensure that every young American inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul. Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of CPAC. And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible."
02:00:05 - 02:00:30 (26 sec),"Your organization is incredible. Matt and Mercedes, incredible. You're energized, you're mobilized, and you're engaged. We need your voice. We need your patriotism. We need your commitment. We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July. We are having, in Washington, D.C., a great tribute to America."
02:00:30 - 02:00:59 (29 sec),"I hope you can all come. Fourth of July -- keep it open. We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country. Those are the people we want. The Fourth of July. A salute to America. Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history. Now is the time to defend our American legacy."
02:00:59 - 02:01:23 (24 sec),"And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny. And, by the way, I'm watching those doors. Not one person has left, and I've been up here a long time. [Laughter] I said, ""Matt, is that okay?"" He said, ""I love it. Don't leave."" But not one person. So if you hear tomorrow, when they read ""people left"" -- nobody left early."
02:01:23 - 02:01:57 (34 sec),"There hasn't been one person that's left. But when you read it, you just say ""fake news."" This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God. Together, we are one people, one family, and one nation, forever united behind one great American flag."
02:01:57 - 02:02:33 (36 sec),"Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country. We're hooked in all over the country. Thank you very much. I want to thank CPAC. What a job they've done. What a job Matt Schlapp and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it's never been before. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much."
00:00:00 - 00:00:22 (23 sec),"That's such a great song. We should just let it play, right? [Laughter] We had a little luck with that song. And he's terrific -- a good supporter. We appreciate it. We really appreciate this, too. I know you have a record crowd; that's nice. It's always nice to set records. And I want to thank Sonny. And he's setting records."
00:00:22 - 00:00:39 (17 sec),"We're setting records together for farmers and for agriculture. We've had so many good weeks and good days, and it's only going to get better because we're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you're not even going to believe it. Your problem will be: What do we do? We need more acreage immediately."
00:00:39 - 00:00:56 (16 sec),"We got to plant. But I will say, we are doing some things with trade that are going to have a tremendous impact. You're going to be doing business with Canada, you're going to be doing business with places where it was very, very difficult to do business. It was very unfair. And a lot of great things are going to happen."
00:00:56 - 00:01:23 (28 sec),"So, I want to really thank everybody here, and I want to congratulate a very, very good and exciting football team that I watched yesterday, the New Orleans Saints. [Applause] You know, it's -- I can see there's a little group over here. I know who I'm talking to. The rest of the room is going like, Eh, I don't want to talk about that. [Laughter] But you have to say, Drew Brees -- he's one hell of a quarterback and it was a tremendous game."
00:01:23 - 00:01:50 (26 sec),"And so congratulations to the folks from this area and from this great state. [Applause] It's a great state. I'm thrilled to be here in a state that I've had a lot of luck with -- and I love a lot of people in this state; I know a lot of people -- for, really, a truly historic occasion. This is the 100th annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation -- 100 exactly."
00:01:50 - 00:02:22 (32 sec),"If it was 99 -- although, I was here for 99, too, I have to be honest, right? I like the farmers. What can I do? I like farmers. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. For 100 years, this organization has faithfully represented the men and women who are the backbone of our country, truly. Let us all show our appreciation for a very dear friend and a leader -- a great leader -- Zippy Duval."
00:02:22 - 00:02:56 (34 sec),"Where's Zippy? Zippy. [Applause] Where is, Zippy? What a job he does. He only called about 100 times to make sure I'm coming. [Laughter] Thank you, Zippy. Great job. On this special anniversary, we gather to celebrate America's proud farming heritage. Through your sweat, through all of your work, the strength of your hands, and the faith in your hearts, the American farmer feeds, and fuels, and sustains our nation."
00:02:56 - 00:03:29 (33 sec),"So true. We are joined today by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. Thank you, Governor, for being here. Thank you. Thank you, John Bel. [Applause] Thank you. Along with many members of Congress who are true champions of American agriculture. An incredibly talented man, a great doctor -- he knows more about healthcare than anybody, and he's somebody that -- he's really helped us out in so many different ways."
00:03:29 - 00:03:47 (19 sec),"And he's yours: Senator Bill Cassidy. Bill? Thank you very much, Bill. [Applause] Appreciate it. A woman who had a tremendous victory -- she came in for a short period of time. She was appointed, and it's always hard when you're appointed. If you look -- I don't know about this, Cindy, but you take a look -- they don't do too well."
00:03:47 - 00:04:17 (30 sec),"You did very well. You won in an incredible state: Mississippi. Cindy Hyde-Smith, thank you. That was a great win. [Applause] A brilliant guy -- he's very deceiving. My wife said, I love watching him on television. And I said, Who? John Kennedy. I said, John Kennedy? I don't know. But, you know, I thought maybe she was talking about the other John Kennedy."
00:04:17 - 00:04:37 (20 sec),"She was talking -- this is a man who is totally brilliant. You know, I don't know if you know what this means: Oxford. Right? He went to Oxford. Oxford is a very -- I'm very much into the world of schools. Oxford -- you have to be very, very smart to go to Oxford. And he's very smart. He also loves this state."
00:04:37 - 00:04:55 (18 sec),"He loves the people. We gave a rally the night before he won that was incredible. And I looked -- and I looked at that crowd. We had to have 40,000 people or more at a hangar -- an airport hangar. I said, You know, John Kennedy? You're going to win. And he won and he won big. And he's my friend. John Kennedy."
00:04:55 - 00:05:21 (26 sec),"Thank you, John. [Applause] Oxford. Oxford John. [Laughs] Great. Congressman Ralph Abraham. Thank you, Congressman. Where are you? Congressman? [Applause] Great job you do. He does a great job. Congressman Garrett Graves. And you know Garrett. Thank you, Garrett. Good job. Young, strong, smart. [Applause] We got a lot of good politicians down here."
00:05:21 - 00:05:50 (29 sec),"And the legend from Louisiana -- a man who's got a lot of courage. He was playing second base and it didn't work out so well for him that day, but I have never seen anybody with more strength and really more courage than Steve Scalise. Steve Scalise. [Applause] He got hit hard. He got hit hard. He never even thought about quitting."
00:05:50 - 00:06:05 (15 sec),"He -- I was there the night, in his hospital. And they didn't think he was going to make it. And I looked at him; he wasn't looking too good, I have to tell you. This is the first time I'm telling you this, Steve; you weren't looking too sharp. And his wife loves him, because she was a mess. She had tears pouring down."
00:06:05 - 00:06:24 (19 sec),"I'll tell you a couple of these little facts. Your family loves you, Steve. But all of a sudden, he started making a little progress, a little more. Worked so hard. And then, a few months ago, he was in a baseball game. And it was the Republicans against the Democrats. He's playing second base. And he didn't have great mobility, to be honest."
00:06:24 - 00:06:44 (20 sec),"In other words, moving like a foot to his right, a foot to the left -- that was about it. And he gets the first pitch of the game. This is in a stadium, and a lot of people watching, and it's on television. And they put him at second base for one play. And the first hit is a smash -- ground ball -- hit at Steve."
00:06:44 - 00:07:02 (18 sec),"And I'm pretty good at this stuff; I look, I say, Oh, that's going right to second base. It went right in him -- right at him. He bent down, stopped that ball, threw it to first. The place went crazy. And he then walked off the field in great triumph. [Laughter and applause] Who could have done that but my Steve, right?"
00:07:02 - 00:07:22 (20 sec),"[Applause] That was incredible. That was incredible. He's a courageous guy. He's a great guy. He's also a really fine person. So, Steve Scalise -- what you've been through, Steve, is incredible. And congratulations. Incredible job. As you all know, there is currently a tremendous humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border."
00:07:22 - 00:07:41 (19 sec),"It's tremendous. It's been there for years. It's been there for decades. But because of what we're doing and because of how well our country is doing -- And please sit down. Please. I'm just looking -- and then the media -- the fake news -- they'll say, He got no standing ovations. You know why? Because everybody stayed standing."
00:07:41 - 00:08:11 (30 sec),"[Laughter] Wait until you see that. It's true. Oh, they'll do it. They'll figure something out. [Applause] That's true. [Applause] That's true. [Laughs] [Applause] That's true. They can figure it out. They can take the best thing -- I go home, I say, Darling, I did such a great job. Wait until you see the news tomorrow on something. [Laughter] North Korea, China."
00:08:11 - 00:08:26 (16 sec),"We're doing great in the trade deal. China -- this, that. They can make anything you do look bad. But I was watching as you're standing. And I said, You know, if they sit, it's probably better for me, because every once in a while, they'll stand. [Laughter] The other way, they'll say, The crowd did not appreciate him."
00:08:26 - 00:08:49 (22 sec),"They didn't give him one standing ovation. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you very much. Women and children are being ruthlessly exploited at our southern border by vicious coyotes -- who would think of this? Human traffickers. Now, when you hear the words human traffickers, you think about 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago."
00:08:49 - 00:09:14 (25 sec),"You wouldn't think it's worse today in the world -- this is a world problem -- than it's ever been. And the reason it's worse is because of the Internet. They target young women. They target young children -- the Internet. And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped -- their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape."
00:09:14 - 00:09:32 (18 sec),"They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the backseat of cars and vans, and they go -- they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that. They come in through our border, where we don't have any barriers or walls."
00:09:32 - 00:09:54 (23 sec),"And they drive right in and they have no problems. And we'll get that stopped. We're going to have a wall. We're going to have a barrier. We're going to have something that's going to be very strong. [Applause] One of the most important things. And I've built a lot of wall. You saw it the other day. They kept saying, You didn't build wall. I said, I built wall. So I actually decided I'd better put a picture for you to see."
00:09:54 - 00:10:22 (28 sec),"But we built a lot more than that. And we renovated a lot of pretty good stuff that we made good again. It was in very bad shape. But we've done a lot. We want to finish it because, you know, you can't have openings. Because if you have an opening, they go here and they just sort of go over this way. They find the open spot, they come in. And we have to build -- what we have to build -- probably a total of 550 miles including the renovations."
00:10:22 - 00:10:43 (21 sec),"And we've done a lot of work. People don't talk about it. I don't talk about it because, until we're finished, the big thing is we have to get it done. And we've had great support from John, your senator; Bill, your senator; from everybody. We've had tremendous -- Steve is working hard in the House. Your congressmen are working really hard."
00:10:43 - 00:11:07 (23 sec),"Really hard. Because it's common sense. What we're talking about is common sense. Last month alone, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought across our borders. Twenty thousand. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the journey up from Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador. Think of that. Think of that."
00:11:07 - 00:11:37 (31 sec),"Hard to believe. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are being smuggled across the border. Most of the drugs coming into our country come in through the southern border -- and much of it comes through areas that are not your portals -- including meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl. Heroin alone, if you look at the heroin epidemic -- it's an epidemic -- heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week."
00:11:37 - 00:11:58 (21 sec),And 90 percent of it -- at least -- crosses our southern border. It comes in through our southern border. And I've spent a lot of time with Secret Service and with Border Patrol and ICE -- incredible people -- and they show me the methods that they use -- how they hide it. They put it in hubcaps. They put it in engines.
00:11:58 - 00:12:22 (24 sec),"They put it in areas you wouldn't believe. They're brilliant, in many ways. They're brilliant. You wouldn't even think of what they do to get things in. And we can stop it. But we can't stop it if we're going to play politics. And the numbers you're talking about are peanuts compared -- you'll make the money back numerous times a year."
00:12:22 - 00:13:05 (43 sec),"In 2017, drugs killed over 70,000 of our fellow citizens -- think of that, that's like a football stadium loaded up -- and imposed costs on our society in excess of $700 billion dollars. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested 266,000 illegal aliens -- think of that -- with criminal records, including 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent murders or killings."
00:13:05 - 00:13:29 (24 sec),"The crisis of illegal immigration impacts all Americans -- threatening public safety, overwhelming public resources, straining our local schools and hospitals, undermining U.S. workers, and claiming countless innocent lives. And I will tell you, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally."
00:13:29 - 00:14:05 (36 sec),"They have to come in through a process. [Applause] Thank you. As President, the defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty. And this is the defense of our nation, just like we prepare for other nations that you think more traditionally is what that sentence refers to. When it comes to keeping the American people safe, I will never, ever back down."
00:14:05 - 00:14:22 (17 sec),"I didn't need this fight. This is a rough fight. We're dealing against people who think that if they can stop me from building the wall -- again, we've already done a lot of work -- but they think that's a good thing for 2020, because they're not going to win. They think if they can stop me from building the wall, that's good."
00:14:22 - 00:14:40 (17 sec),"This is the reason why they don't want the wall built -- because they all know it works. They all approved it numerous times. I mean, Chuck Schumer had his hand up every time this would come up. The senators know this. They're only doing this because of the 2020 election because I said I'll build the wall and I'm going to build the wall."
00:14:40 - 00:15:17 (38 sec),"And it's only one of many things that I promised. I mean, if you look at -- [Applause] -- I got you the biggest tax cut -- beyond the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. ANWR, getting rid of the individual mandate, the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country -- and we're going further. [Applause] That might be the biggest reason that our country is doing so much better than other countries and why we're doing so well."
00:15:17 - 00:15:36 (19 sec),"But they view this as a political thing because this was one of the big things I -- I said, We're going to do tax cuts. We're going to do regulation. We're going to doâ¦ And, you know, we've done most of what we said. One of the -- that's a lot of news back there. One of the folks back there said that He's actually done more than he promised. It's true."
00:15:36 - 00:15:58 (22 sec),"I have actually done more than I promised. We've done a lot. Even with the veterans. [Applause] A lot of veterans in Louisiana. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Choice approved, which is pretty amazing. They've been trying to get that for years and years -- decades and decades. And we got Accountability -- VA Accountability."
00:15:58 - 00:16:21 (23 sec),"When you had somebody treating our veterans horribly, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't fire them -- whether it's unions, or whether it's civil service, or whatever it may have been. But for decades and decades, somebody could do anything they wanted. They can steal, they could abuse our veterans, they can be sadists, they can do whatever they want and you couldn't fire them."
00:16:21 - 00:16:47 (26 sec),"And I got Accountability approved. Everyone said you couldn't get that -- too much power against it. We got it done, and now we can say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here. We don't want you taking care of our veterans. [Applause] That was a big thing. A lot of help from those people. So we got a lot done, but they view the wall as being a big item that, if I don't do it, you know, it's a negative."
00:16:47 - 00:17:14 (27 sec),"It's a negative. And I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm doing it because we have to do it. It's common sense. We have to do it. If you look at the caravans coming up, if you look at what's going on -- you take a look. If we didn't have some of those walls -- the military has been incredible. They came up and they built some barriers -- they kept thousands and thousands of people from overrunning various sections of our country."
00:17:14 - 00:17:39 (25 sec),"We've done a great job at the border, but we need that extra -- we need that barrier because you can't do this. You can have all the people you want dressed in military. You can have ICE. You can have Border Patrol. If you don't have that barrier, there's not a thing you can do. You know, they all say, We like technology. I like technology, too."
00:17:39 - 00:18:08 (29 sec),"But we can have all the drones in the world flying around; we can have all the sensors in the world, but if you don't have a strong steel or concrete barrier, there's no way you're going to stop these people from rushing. Last week -- and we have no idea who they are. And you got some -- I'm sure -- very good ones, but you got some real bad ones."
00:18:08 - 00:18:52 (44 sec),"Last week, I traveled to McAllen, Texas to tour the border and meet with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. These great patriots made clear what they need from Congress and to end this terrible crisis. And we will end it. We will end it. You know, when we have proper security, people aren't going to come, except for the people we want to come because we want to take people in to help our farmers, et cetera."
00:18:52 - 00:19:09 (17 sec),"Very important. We're going to make that actually easier for them -- to help the farmers. [Applause] Because you need these people. No, you need these people. We're going to make it easier. [Applause] I mean, I'm glad I told you that because, you know, look, you're in that business and a lot of people don't understand this."
00:19:09 - 00:19:29 (20 sec),"You need those -- you need people to help you with the farms. And I'm not going to rule that out. I'm going to make that easier for them to come in and to work the farms. You've had some people for 20, 25 years. They're incredible. Then they go home and they can't get back in. That's not going to happen."
00:19:29 - 00:19:59 (30 sec),"But we're keeping the wrong ones out, okay? We don't want the wrong ones coming into our country. And, for that, it's going to be almost impossible to get in. For the people that work the farms, that have been here, that have gone through this very short but good process, that are going to help our country, it's going to be easier for them to get in that what they have to go through now."
00:19:59 - 00:20:26 (26 sec),"So just remember that. [Applause] I know a lot about the farming world. And, if I don't, Sonny teaches me. They explained that there is no substitute for a wall -- these are the ICE people and the Border Patrol people -- or a physical barrier. There is no substitute. Where a barrier exists, illegal crossings plummet dramatically."
00:20:26 - 00:20:56 (30 sec),"In El Paso, they had -- it was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. A wall was put up. It went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight -- overnight. Does that tell you something? [Applause] And I can give you many examples of that."
00:20:56 - 00:21:22 (26 sec),"They say it's medieval -- a wall. It is medieval. So is a wheel. I always say a wheel. But every time I look out, they all have wheels. You know, they may have gone electric and they may have done lots of different things, but every car I've seen still has wheels. [Laughter] Wheels work and walls work."
00:21:22 - 00:21:41 (18 sec),"You know, there's some things you can't beat. [Applause] That's why we've asked Congress to fund a steel barrier, or whatever you want to call it. This barrier will stop illegal activity, while directing lawful trade, travel, and commerce to our ports of entry. These ports are America's doors, but doors only work when you have strength."
00:21:41 - 00:22:00 (20 sec),"We need strength. Right now, we have weakness. They're forming a new caravan in Honduras. Honduras is not helping us. They could stop it. We send them hundreds of millions of dollars a year -- El Salvador, Honduras, and other places -- Guatemala -- hundreds of millions, but they don't help us, like so many nations."
00:22:00 - 00:22:22 (22 sec),We help them; they don't help us. We don't even get their votes often when we need their vote in the United Nations. They don't vote for us. Why? Because the wrong people are asking them. So those days are over. So I said just before I came -- we're looking at a whole plan -- why are we sending them money if they're allowing caravans to form right in the middle of their cities?
00:22:22 - 00:22:46 (24 sec),"Why are we sending them money? [Applause] A lot of changes have been made in this country in less than two years, I will tell you that. A lot of changes. And really good changes -- changes that people like you, with common sense and smarts, fully understand. And that's why we're liking where we are and the country is changing very rapidly for the better."
00:22:46 - 00:23:12 (27 sec),"As part of our overall border security plan, we have also asked Congress to approve cutting-edge technology to detect drugs. There's incredible technology today. So when these cars do come in through the ports of entry, you have technology today that's so incredible. We don't use it. We don't have it because our leaders decided not to spend the money."
00:23:12 - 00:23:35 (23 sec),"Well, you make it back every month -- probably more than that -- because the drugs coming through the southern border are destroying the fabric of our country. It's so bad. It's so bad. [Applause] So we have to stop it. This technology is incredible. To fund more agents -- we're putting that high on the list -- officers, beds."
00:23:35 - 00:24:06 (31 sec),"Believe it or not, we're one of the only countries -- I say one, because every time I say something else they'll say, Oh, well, there was a country that also did it. Somebody comes into our country, they touch one foot on the ground, and we have to catch them. It's called, catch. We then take their names and we bring them to a court -- can you believe this?"
00:24:06 - 00:24:24 (17 sec),"-- and we release them. But, see, we're trying to do catch-and-hold. Catch-and-not-release. But you have to release. So we release. And they go into our country, and then you announce -- these are the laws -- then you say, Come back in three years for your trial. Tell me, what percentage of people come back?"
00:24:24 - 00:24:43 (19 sec),"Would you say 100 percent? No, you're a little off. Like, how about 2 percent? [Laughter] And those people, you almost don't want, because they cannot be very smart. [Laughter] Two percent. Two percent. Two percent come back. Those two percent are not going to make America great again, that I can tell you."
00:24:43 - 00:25:02 (19 sec),"[Laughter and applause] Crazy. So we have that and we have chain migration, where somebody comes in, and then his mother comes in, his father comes in, his grandmother comes in, his uncle comes in, his cousins come in. We had a guy -- a radical Islamic terrorist in New York -- area I know very well -- driving down the West Side highway."
00:25:02 - 00:25:23 (21 sec),"Beautiful -- Hudson River to his right. We built this gorgeous park all along the river. It's gorgeous. People are running; they're in great shape. We ought to all -- some of these guys in the front row, they should do it with me. We could run. [Laughter] Some of my friends over there. Sonny -- maybe Sonny and I will go take a jog."
00:25:23 - 00:25:43 (20 sec),"[Laughter] But you know what? I'll tell you, these are people that are great people, and they're running and they keep -- and this horrible person, going down 60 miles an hour down a highway, decides, Oh, that's nice. We'll make a right turn. Hits a whole group of people purposely, screaming all sorts of things that they scream."
00:25:43 - 00:26:11 (28 sec),"And 8 people died; 12 or 13 were injured. Nobody talks about the injured. You know, some of the injured lost legs, lost arms. You know, this is -- they say, Oh, well, 12 were injured. You know, like, injured -- you think, like, a headache. No, no. They lost arms. They lost legs. One lost two legs. So 12 were horribly injured."
00:26:11 - 00:26:32 (21 sec),"And he's allowed to have his family come here. So they checked, and they said that he had about 22 people came in -- chain migration. In other words, because he's here -- so a whole group of people come in. And we don't want that. We have another one -- the lottery. The lottery. We take people from countries through the lottery."
00:26:32 - 00:26:59 (27 sec),"Now, this is common sense. Do you think the country is giving us their finest? No, they're not. No, they're not. They're giving us the opposite of their finest. And we have a lottery system. Oh, let's pick him out. Oh, wonderful. Doesn't work out too well, this lottery system. But this is the law. This was passed by Democrats and, I guess, Republicans."
00:26:59 - 00:27:18 (19 sec),"You know, maybe they voted -- who knows? But these are laws that have to be changed. These are -- these are sick, demented laws that we have to change. We can't allow this to keep happening. The people that are sent to our country are not the people that we want. They come in through the lottery. They come in through chain migration."
00:27:18 - 00:27:50 (31 sec),"Think of it: This man that killed 8 people and so badly injured 12, they say he's about 22 relatives coming in that are here. And take a look at how well his relatives are doing. It's not a good picture. So we have to change our laws. It's very hard because the Democrats don't want to change them. But I hope that common sense and people like this can persuade them, because it's gotten to a point where you have to. We really have no choice."
00:27:50 - 00:28:16 (27 sec),"And we're fighting hard. We're fighting very hard for you. We're making a lot of progress, I can tell you that. [Applause] Here with us today is Jim Chilton from Arizona. Jim's ranch runs along the U.S-Mexico border. The deadly -- very deadly -- Sinaloa cartel, one of the most vicious drug cartels anywhere in the world, runs a major drug trafficking route right through Jim's ranch."
00:28:16 - 00:28:36 (19 sec),"Many of these routes used to run through San Diego until the wall was built by us, by me. [Applause] Sorry about that, Jim. [Laughs] I think Jim has just got angry at me; he just heard that. Sorry, Jim. Because now, what they did, they went to Jim's ranch. I think I cost him a lot of money. Maybe he won't stand up after all."
00:28:36 - 00:29:35 (60 sec),"But it's a very sad situation. In the last two years, the cameras on Jim's ranch have captured roughly 1,000 pictures of major drug packers, they call them. For years, these criminals have damaged Jim's property, injured his livestock, and started dozens of fire, which Jim estimates cost more than $2 million dollars in 2017 alone."
00:29:35 - 00:30:09 (33 sec),"Last June, a Border Patrol agent was checking sensors on the Clinton's -- and Chilton's ranch when he was shot multiple times by these sinister drug traffickers. Multiple times. And they don't even think about. By the way, they shoot -- it's not like, Oh, gee, I committed a terrible thing. They don't even think about it. They don't even think."
00:30:09 - 00:30:21 (13 sec),"They wake up the next morning and they couldn't care less. As Jim has said, Every time I leave the ranch, my wife doesn't know whether I'll ever return. I would like to ask Jim to come up and say a few words. Jim, please come up. Thank you. [Applause]"
00:30:21 - 00:30:31 (9 sec),"Mr. President, we need a wall. [Applause] I would say we need a wall all around all the length of the border. We've got to stop the drug packers bringing drugs in to poison our people. And I would say to Speaker Pelosi, walls are not immoral. [Applause]"
00:30:31 - 00:30:50 (19 sec),"In fact, I've traveled around the world, and the biggest wall I've ever seen is around the Vatican. Now, you can't tell me that the wonderful priest and officials of the Roman Catholic Church, including the Pope, are immoral. They have a wall. Why can't we? [Applause]"
00:30:50 - 00:31:11 (20 sec),"Thank you, Jim. [Applause] Thank you, Jim. And I'm sorry for your problems, but we'll get it straightened out. The government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: The Democrats will not fund border security, our safety, our national security. People come from many countries."
00:31:11 - 00:31:34 (23 sec),"When I was at the wall the other day, Border Patrol said they have 150 people they caught that day who weren't from Mexico. I said, That's a strange statement. They said, No, these are the people that weren't from Mexico. And I was surprised. Three were from Pakistan. Four were from another Mid-East -- two Mid-East countries."
00:31:34 - 00:32:00 (26 sec),"And many of them were from other countries, including China -- countries all over the world. A hundred and fifty of the people, as he said, were not from Mexico. Now, they caught many, many more, but that's a 150 people coming from companies that -- you know, really, countries that you wouldn't believe. They will not approve the measures we need to keep America safe -- the Democrats."
00:32:00 - 00:32:18 (18 sec),"We can't do that. We can't do that because this is of paramount importance to our country. And again, I could take it nice and easy. I could enjoy myself. I could relax. I've been in the White House because I think it's very important to be there. And other people went on a nice, wonderful vacation over the weekend."
00:32:18 - 00:32:44 (26 sec),They had a great time. I would have loved to have been with them. I didn't like the look of it. I would have loved to have been with them. But we have a very big problem. This should have been done by other Presidents. Just like the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem should have been done -- it was promised by many other Presidents. [Applause]
00:32:44 - 00:33:07 (23 sec),"Just like we're doing the job on North Korea, just like we're doing the job with China -- we're getting it done. We're getting it done. We're getting it all done. But it would have been nice if other administrations were able to do it. But we have to do the border. In the meantime, the USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown."
00:33:07 - 00:33:30 (23 sec),"We thank you for your support and patriotism. And we fight to defend our nation. We are fighting very hard to defend our nation. And many people that aren't getting a payment, that aren't being paid, have let us know in the strongest of terms -- a big amount -- they said, Sir, what you're doing is of paramount importance."
00:33:30 - 00:33:56 (25 sec),"Do the job right, and we are with you, 100 percent. You'd be surprised at how many people have said that. And it's not easy for them, but it's a lot of people. [Applause] So I'm asking all of our citizens to call your Democrat lawmakers and ask them to pass a bill that secures our border, protects our country, and now reopens our government."
00:33:56 - 00:34:17 (21 sec),"Because as soon as they do that, we reopen our government. You would think that would be a very simple task. On every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers. We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible. I saw what was going on in Canada -- the way you were treated."
00:34:17 - 00:34:41 (24 sec),"Horrible. And they treated their farmers great. Great. We changed it with the new trade deal we made with Mexico and Canada. And opening up new markets to export -- many, many new markets are being opened up. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And the farmers got hit probably as hard as anybody."
00:34:41 - 00:35:18 (37 sec),"We're reversing harmful federal intrusion. And to keep family farms in the family, we have virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Small business owners and corporations and others -- small business -- it was a terrible thing that was happening, where your parents -- you love your parents -- they're farmers -- they love their farms."
00:35:18 - 00:35:34 (15 sec),"Everybody loves their farm. The kids -- they want to grow up on the farm. They want to someday run the farm, own the farm. And they couldn't because they had very large estate taxes to pay. So they go out and borrow money, and then it turned a little bit bad. And all of the sudden, they'd end up losing the farm because they had to pay the estate tax."
00:35:34 - 00:35:53 (19 sec),"We got rid of it, folks. So if you love your children, you'll like me. If you don't love your children, and you weren't going to leave the farm to them, it probably doesn't matter too much, okay? [Laughter] Does anybody here not love their children? Wow, that's a lot of people -- not one? Okay, you don't want to say."
00:35:53 - 00:36:09 (15 sec),"That's all right. [Laughter] That's like a lot of the people that went to the polls; they voted for Trump. [Laughter] They said, We don't want to talk about it. Then we won. We won two years ago. In November, we won. [Applause] And everybody is trying -- they're still trying to figure out what happened."
00:36:09 - 00:36:37 (28 sec),"We don't have to talk about it. We know what we're doing. We're ensuring that ethanol remains a vital part of America's energy future, with E-15. And we're making it available year round -- all 12 months. That was a big, big difference for the farmers. [Applause] Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst -- your senators -- a lot of great people were very strong on that."
00:36:37 - 00:37:00 (23 sec),"And it also creates additional, because, if you noticed, I think we saw $1.75 for gasoline today, coming in. I like to do that; I'm one of these guys. [Applause] I'm riding in this incredible car, and I'm driving, and I'm looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas. How many other Presidents -- you think Hillary Clinton would have done that?"
00:37:00 - 00:37:20 (20 sec),"I don't think so. I don't think so. [Laughter and applause] I'm in the Beast -- the world's most expensive car. It's like being in an army tank that goes 50 miles an hour, right? I'm in the Beast and I'm looking at gas stations. I say, Fellas, slow up. I can't see. [Laughter] They say, $1.75. That didn't happen by accident, folks."
00:37:20 - 00:37:41 (21 sec),"That didn't happen by accident. People think it does; it doesn't. Nothing happens -- very few, very little happens by accident. Nobody else would have done what we did for the farmers, with the estate taxes and so many other things. In the two years before my election, agricultural exports dropped by nearly $23 billion."
00:37:41 - 00:38:13 (32 sec),"Remember that: Before I got here, it was heading south. A lot of people say, Oh, gee, how are we doing? It was going bad. If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office. They were less. Now they're up nearly $14 billion. In December, just a few days before Christmas, I was proud to sign the Farm Bill."
00:38:13 - 00:38:49 (36 sec),"We got it done. That wasn't easy either. [Applause] That was not easy. Senators, Congressmen, thank you. That group did it. [Applause] That was not an easy one, John and Bill, was it, huh? That wasn't easy. But we got it done. The first to be passed, on time, in over 30 years. Got it done. And I've authorized Secretary Perdue to be strong on work rules for the Food Stamp program, through regulations allowed by the bill."
00:38:49 - 00:39:12 (24 sec),"So I know you have a great Secretary. He'll do what's right. The Farm Bill delivers for our farmers on a wide range of key priorities. On critical farm programs, such as crop insurance, you will have the support you need to plan for the future. It increases the amount farmers can borrow so you can expand and improve your businesses."
00:39:12 - 00:39:37 (25 sec),"It also secures the $600 million commitment we made to build a modern, effective, rural broadband across America's heartland. You're not well serviced. [Applause] That's something the great, great middle part of our country has been complaining about for a long time. You're not properly serviced. You will be now."
00:39:37 - 00:40:08 (31 sec),"You will be now. That bill is a great bill for the farmer. Last year, when I spoke to you, we had just passed our historic tax cuts. Here with us today is Kalena Bruce from Stockton, Missouri. Kalena is a rancher, and also an accountant for local farmers. Under our new tax plan, which lowers rates for small businesses and doubles the tax child credit -- so important, that child tax credit."
00:40:08 - 00:40:30 (22 sec),"You know who fought for that? A young woman named Ivanka Trump. That's all she wanted. Dad? Dad? We have to get that passed, Dad. [Applause] I said, Okay, Ivanka. Okay. Okay. [Laughter] It turned out to be so popular. Kalena has seen that many families will save upwards of $4,000 in taxes this year alone."
00:40:30 - 00:40:54 (25 sec),"Kalena, I want to thank you and all of those incredible people that you represent. And just keep up the great work. Where is Kalena? Where is Kalena? She's around here someplace. Hi, Kalena. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. [Applause] We're also leading the most sweeping regulatory reform at any time in our history."
00:40:54 - 00:41:21 (27 sec),"The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled back almost $400 million in regulatory costs last year alone. And this year, they're projected to more than double those savings. We're saving farmers and ranchers from one of the most ridiculous regulations ever imposed on anybody in our nation: the Waters of the United States rule."
00:41:21 - 00:41:59 (38 sec),"[Applause] Disaster -- other than the title. Such a beautiful title. It was a total kill on farmers, on builders, on everybody. It was a total kill. Sounds so nice. In fact, I looked at John Kennedy, when I signed that. I said, John, I'm going to get killed for this one. Because what we did was take something -- the Water of the United States. How beautiful is that?"
00:41:59 - 00:42:19 (20 sec),"And yet, everything inside was a total kill on you -- and other businesses, by the way. [Applause] And we didn't get killed, did we, John, huh? We didn't. They love it. So many people have come -- and, you know, the time when I signed that bill, I had ranchers, farmers, and some homebuilders behind me. And these are tough people."
00:42:19 - 00:42:38 (19 sec),"They were strong, tough men and women. And half of them were crying because we basically -- our government stole their property. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't build. They couldn't do anything. They were crying. I said, What are you crying about? The one guy -- I don't think he cried in his whole life."
00:42:38 - 00:43:00 (22 sec),"I don't think he cried when we was a baby. He was crying. [Laughter] He said, Sir, you gave me back my life. You gave me back my property. They took it away -- environmentally, took it away. And you're going to do the right thing. In the audience today is Val Wagner from Monango, North Dakota. Val -- [Applause]. [Laughs] It's a good place."
00:43:00 - 00:43:22 (22 sec),"[Laughter] You have a great new senator, by the way. [Applause] A great new senator. Really great. Val and her husband would love to expand their farm for their four boys, but under the Waters of the United States rule, they would have to pay tens and of thousands of dollars in fines because of the prairie potholes on their land."
00:43:22 - 00:43:48 (25 sec),"Do you all know what prairie potholes are? Yes, you do. I don't, but it sounds bad. [Laughter] To Val and to every farmer, we are going to keep federal regulators out of your -- out of your tanks -- your stock tanks, your drainage ditches, your puddles, and your ponds. And you know exactly what I'm talking about."
00:43:48 - 00:44:21 (34 sec),"You could have a pond -- a little pond -- and they consider it a lake. [Applause] And you're regulated as though it were a lake. We're going to get government off your backs so you can earn a living and support your families doing what you love. And I know what you love. Farmers love what they're doing. [Applause] We also passed legislation to rebuild our water infrastructure, including our nation's inland waterways, which carry more than 60 percent of our agricultural products."
00:44:21 - 00:44:48 (27 sec),"We are replacing one-sided, unfair trade deals. We have so many nations -- it's a one-sided deal. With China, every year, for many years, we're losing $375 billion -- not million, billion dollars. We're working on that very strongly. You see what's going on. We're doing very well. We have the European Union -- they don't treat us right."
00:44:48 - 00:45:05 (17 sec),"They treat our farmers terribly. You can hardly sell into the -- they have barriers and they have tariffs that are massive. But with the farmers, they don't want your product. We're working with them; they have to treat us fairly. We're losing $151 billion a year with the European Union. It sounds so nice, right?"
00:45:05 - 00:45:21 (17 sec),"The European Union. And then the press gets angry. They say, Donald Trump is not treating the European Union fairly. Well, that's because they're not treating us fairly, folks. I want to be nice. In fact, they said my poll numbers are very bad in Europe. I said, They should be. [Laughter] No, seriously."
00:45:21 - 00:45:59 (38 sec),"They said, When he started off, he had 87 percent. That means you could be the king of any country. Now, they [Inaudible] because I'm representing our country; I'm not representing those country -- you know, one of those [Inaudible]. [Applause] True. It's true. They said, His poll numbers have tanked. And I said, Oh, damn it. What's going on? Damn it. And then I said, Oh, it's in Europe."
00:45:59 - 00:46:24 (25 sec),"That's okay. [Laughter] No, we get along well with them. And they're a lot of great people and great leaders. But, look, I'm not blaming them. I don't blame China. I mean, China -- $375 billion a year, we lose. It's really more than that, but that's like the conservative number. I think it's $504 [Billion]. But I'm giving you conservative because I don't want to be criticized for using wrong numbers, right?"
00:46:24 - 00:46:43 (19 sec),"[Laughter] But I don't blame China. I was in China making a speech, and President Xi -- who's a friend of -- great guy. But he represent them; I represent us. And he's sitting over here. And I'm talking to this massive crowd of people. And I'm talking about how China is bad, bad, bad. And I'm saying, Boy, this is -- this could be dangerous. [Laughter] I'm in China."
00:46:43 - 00:47:14 (30 sec),"I'm in Beijing doing this. And I'm saying, I don't like this. But I looked at him, and I realized -- actually during that speech -- it's not his fault or their fault. It's our fault for allowing that to happen. It's our leaders' fault. [Applause] Over the last 15 years, we've seen a continual decline in the U.S. share of agricultural trade all throughout the world."
00:47:14 - 00:47:30 (16 sec),"You know that. It was all going in the wrong direction. It's changing now. Wait until you see what happens. If we do the right deal with China, you're talking about massive -- they're already backordering, right? They're already back. I told them. I said, You got to start ordering. You're going to order. They're going to order, and they've already started."
00:47:30 - 00:48:05 (35 sec),"We're turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American farmers, ranchers, and, in fact, put America first. That's what I'm interested in: America first. [Applause] We just opened Argentina to American pork exports -- pork -- for the first time in a quarter of a century. They needed something; I said, You have to open it up to pork. And they said, Okay. I said, Why didn't you do it before? They said, Nobody ever asked us. [Laughter] A lot of it is that."
00:48:05 - 00:48:30 (24 sec),"You would be amazed. Nobody ever asks. India and Morocco have both opened their markets to our poultry exports. We do so much for them. It's incredible. Japan opened its market to U.S. exports of potatoes from Idaho -- [Applause] -- and lamb from the great state of Texas, yes. No, they just opened up. We asked them."
00:48:30 - 00:48:51 (22 sec),"We said, You got to open up. Sorry. U.S. beef has been shipped to Brazil for the first time since 2003. They're going to have a great new leader. They say he's the Donald Trump of South America. Do you believe that? [Applause] And he's happy with that. If he wasn't, I wouldn't like the country so much."
00:48:51 - 00:49:21 (30 sec),"But I like him. And we opened China to American beef for the first time in many, many years. We've taken -- [Applause]. You know that. But that was before the trade deal. Don't even worry about it. This is -- that's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. We've taken the toughest-ever actions to confront China's unfair trade practices that hurt American farmers and ranchers."
00:49:21 - 00:49:59 (38 sec),"This includes China's theft of trade secrets from American agri-business. I couldn't believe how complicated your business is -- with the seeds and the genetic farming. It's incredible. People don't know this. But your secrets were being stolen by China, and, in all fairness, other countries. We want a fair deal for American farmers -- removing China's arbitrary bans on agricultural imports, safeguarding our intellectual property, and providing fair market access to all American producers."
00:49:59 - 00:50:35 (36 sec),"We have also made history by finalizing an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the USMCA. A whole different world. A whole different world. [Applause] NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made by a country. It killed our country. This landmark trade deal will increase exports of wheat from Montana, dairy from Wisconsin, chicken from Georgia, and products from farmers and ranchers all across our country."
00:50:35 - 00:51:03 (28 sec),"As part of the USMCA, Canada agreed to give fair treatment to American wheat farmers. They will now grade American wheat just like they grade their own wheat. [Applause] Which, to me, doesn't mean much, but, to farmers, it means a lot. That's what they tell me. I said, What can we do? They said that would be a big thing -- on wheat."
00:51:03 - 00:51:25 (22 sec),"Even the NFL -- you know, the NFL, for many years, was having a hard time with Canada, having to do with the Super Bowl. I heard about it, and I asked about it. And it was a lot of money, but it was tiny compared to the overall deal with Canada and with Mexico. So, as one of the things, I said, You got to treat the NFL fairly. You know, it's a great American company."
00:51:25 - 00:51:45 (20 sec),"And we had the dispute over the National Anthem, and that seems to have worked out properly, which is great, which I give them credit for now. And I said, Listen, when you go to Canada, you're going to ask for this thing because they're not treating our company right. Any company -- I don't care, but that was the NFL."
00:51:45 - 00:52:23 (38 sec),"A big company. A great American company. I said, You're not treating them well. We asked for it; in one minute, we solved a problem that they've been working on for many years. Total success. And they called up, and they thanked me. But it's something that I want to do for American companies. It's easy, it's short, it took a few minutes, and we got it. They were fighting for years."
00:52:23 - 00:52:59 (36 sec),"Canada also agreed to end unfair trade practices that hurt American dairy exports. Also here today are Cris and Gary Peterson, and their son Ben and daughter-in-law Nicki. More than 140 years ago, Gary's great-grandmother began their farm in a tremendous state -- I love this state. Remember when they say, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin? That state hasn't been won by a Republican in so long."
00:52:59 - 00:53:24 (25 sec),"Bill, you don't remember any wins there, right? That was a long time ago. That was even before your time. Right, Bill? A long time. And they said, Donald Trumpâ¦ Remember that? Was that a great evening or what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. [Applause] We love Wisconsin. Today, the Petersons have more than 900 dairy cows."
00:53:24 - 00:53:52 (28 sec),"Like so many of our great farmers, the Petersons have faced a number of threats to their farm and to their entire way of life. For years, NAFTA made it difficult for dairy farmers like the Petersons to export milk, ice cream, cheese, and many other dairy products. Under the USMCA, the Peterson family will finally have the level playing field that they should have had for many years."
00:53:52 - 00:54:17 (25 sec),"They have it now. Together, we urge Congress to support American agriculture, stand up for American workers, and hopefully they will approve the USMCA quite quickly. You know, the one thing I worry about -- it's almost -- no matter how good something is, they might not want to approve it, but they'll approve it. This one -- I think it's going to be very tough for them not."
00:54:17 - 00:54:43 (26 sec),"But I think that -- I hear it's in very good shape. And it replaces something that has been so bad to our country. This is a great deal. As we reverse the damage of decades of unfair trade, we are also providing up to $12 billion in relief to protect our farmers from unfair foreign retaliation. And you saw that recently with Sonny Perdue, where we were helping out during a very unfair period of time when people were actually trying to affect our election."
00:54:43 - 00:55:05 (22 sec),"Nobody brings that up. In this case, it was China. I haven't heard too much about that. Have you heard anything about that? But they were. And we helped our farmers out. No one understands better than our great farmers that the tough choices we make today reap rewards for centuries to come. More than 200 years ago, this very city was at the center of America's negotiations during the legendary Louisiana Purchase."
00:55:05 - 00:55:38 (32 sec),"No one knew how it would all turn out, but President Thomas Jefferson acted decisively for the American people. After months of negotiations, we got what no one ever imagined possible. Not only did we gain New Orleans, we doubled the size of the United States; we secured new parts and ports -- new parts of the map and globe that we never thought, and new ports, very importantly for American agriculture; and we made our nation the greatest farm country on God's Earth."
00:55:38 - 00:56:21 (43 sec),"And it remains that. And it's now, for the first time in a long time, getting better. [Applause] Our nation was founded, settled, and built by farmers. [Applause] From the fields of Pennsylvania to the hills of Tennessee -- [Applause]; from the plains of Missouri -- [Applause] -- to the Big Sky of Montana -- [Applause]; and from the marshes of Florida -- [Applause] -- to the fertile valley of California -- [Applause] -- farmers have always led the way."
00:56:21 - 00:56:58 (37 sec),"[Applause] The American farmer embodies the timeless values of America. You believe in hard work and self-reliance. You follow the rules, obey our laws, and respect our great American flag. [Applause] You support our communities, raise loving families, teach your children right from wrong, and you are always loyal to this magnificent nation that we so love."
00:56:58 - 00:57:30 (32 sec),"Now you have a government that is loyal to you, finally, in return. [Applause] Because we know that government's first duty is to our own citizens. We are fighting for the American farmer, and we are fighting for the American Dream, and for products made and grown with pride right here in the USA. It's what we're fighting for."
00:57:30 - 00:58:00 (30 sec),"[Applause] We are defending a cherished legacy, and we are preserving a beautiful way of life passed down from mothers and fathers to sons and daughters, from generation to generation. You are the keepers of this noble tradition. You are the guardians of this majestic heritage. We are standing up for the men and women who work the fields, till the soil, and harvest the land."
00:58:00 - 00:58:48 (48 sec),"We are protecting your rights, your freedoms, and our glorious Constitution. And we are doing it all with love in our hearts, joy in our souls, and trust in our God. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. To all of the farmers here today and across our country, the greatest harvest is yet to come. The future for America's farmers is bigger, better, bolder, and brighter than ever before."
00:58:48 - 00:59:02 (14 sec),"I just want to thank you all for being here. I'm so honored to have had this kind of a turnout, this kind of a record. I want to thank the American Farm Bureau for the incredible job they do."
00:59:02 - 00:59:26 (24 sec),"I'm proud to be a great friend of the farmer, of the rancher, of the people who so nobly do what you do. God bless you all. God bless our farmers. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. [Applause]"
00:00:00 - 00:00:29 (29 sec),"My fellow Americans. Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country."
00:00:29 - 00:01:02 (33 sec),"America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources, and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl."
00:01:02 - 00:01:40 (38 sec),"Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings."
00:01:40 - 00:02:09 (29 sec),"Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now. This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase."
00:02:09 - 00:02:34 (25 sec),These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims -- by far -- of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.
00:02:34 - 00:03:03 (29 sec),"This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security."
00:03:03 - 00:03:38 (35 sec),"These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission, and keep America safe -- in fact, safer than ever before. The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy."
00:03:38 - 00:04:10 (32 sec),"Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes, so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home. Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier."
00:04:10 - 00:04:44 (35 sec),"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress."
00:04:44 - 00:05:10 (25 sec),"The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They change their mind only after I was elected president."
00:05:10 - 00:05:37 (28 sec),"Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security."
00:05:37 - 00:06:05 (27 sec),My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.
00:06:05 - 00:06:34 (29 sec),"Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security. Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside."
00:06:34 - 00:07:00 (26 sec),The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized. America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border.
00:07:00 - 00:07:28 (27 sec),"The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history."
00:07:28 - 00:08:03 (35 sec),"In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors, were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl. Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration."
00:08:03 - 00:08:48 (45 sec),"I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? For those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered, and totally broken."
00:08:48 - 00:09:20 (32 sec),"To every member of Congress: pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen: call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve."
00:09:20 - 00:09:35 (14 sec),"When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country, and that is what I will always do, so help me God. Thank you, and good night."
00:00:00 - 00:01:27 (87 sec),"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation."
00:01:27 - 00:02:19 (53 sec),"The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican Agenda or a Democrat Agenda. It is the agenda of the American People. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first."
00:02:19 - 00:03:13 (54 sec),"There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the Majesty of America's Mission, and the Power of American Pride."
00:03:13 - 00:03:58 (45 sec),"In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade -- the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6th, 1944, fifteen thousand young American men jumped from the sky and sixty thousand more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny."
00:03:58 - 00:05:21 (83 sec),"Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon."
00:05:21 - 00:06:39 (78 sec),"Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle-class standard of living for the entire world to see."
00:06:39 - 00:07:58 (80 sec),"Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this Great American Adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our Middle Class bigger and more prosperous than ever before."
00:07:58 - 00:08:50 (52 sec),"But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future."
00:08:50 - 00:09:41 (51 sec),"The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades."
00:09:41 - 00:10:12 (30 sec),"In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom -- a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started."
00:10:12 - 00:10:49 (37 sec),"Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
00:10:49 - 00:12:42 (113 sec),"Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history -- 157 million."
00:12:42 - 00:13:57 (75 sec),"We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty â and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try."
00:13:57 - 00:14:58 (61 sec),My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American Energy -- the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.
00:14:58 - 00:16:59 (121 sec),"And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is Strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before."
00:16:59 - 00:18:06 (67 sec),"On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone -- almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation."
00:18:06 - 00:19:02 (56 sec),"It just doesn't work that way. We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate -- some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country."
00:19:02 - 00:20:05 (63 sec),"Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans."
00:20:05 - 00:20:59 (55 sec),"And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking Criminal Justice Reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path."
00:20:59 - 00:21:58 (59 sec),"She had a big impact on that prison population -- and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing -- and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice's sentence -- when I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing -- Alice is here with us tonight."
00:21:58 - 00:23:20 (82 sec),"Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. Inspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community."
00:23:20 - 00:23:59 (39 sec),"The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, states across the country are following our lead. America is a nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses."
00:23:59 - 00:25:10 (71 sec),"Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of All Americans: welcome home. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis."
00:25:10 - 00:26:06 (56 sec),"Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our Southern Border. Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business."
00:26:06 - 00:26:46 (40 sec),"As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our Southern Border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught."
00:26:46 - 00:27:21 (35 sec),"This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our Southern Border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws."
00:27:21 - 00:28:33 (72 sec),"Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration."
00:28:33 - 00:29:24 (51 sec),"Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."
00:29:24 - 00:30:20 (57 sec),Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel. 1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
00:30:20 - 00:31:06 (45 sec),"Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our Southern Border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City."
00:31:06 - 00:31:42 (36 sec),"We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads and families -- no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured."
00:31:42 - 00:32:26 (44 sec),"Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison."
00:32:26 - 00:33:44 (78 sec),"To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings."
00:33:44 - 00:34:39 (55 sec),"We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking."
00:34:39 - 00:36:19 (101 sec),"Elvin says: ""If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job."" Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars. Special Agent Hernandez please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement -- and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our Southern Border."
00:36:19 - 00:37:11 (52 sec),"It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall."
00:37:11 - 00:38:01 (50 sec),"It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings."
00:38:01 - 00:39:13 (72 sec),"The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime -- one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe."
00:39:13 - 00:42:02 (169 sec),"As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before -- and exactly one century after Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than ever before."
00:42:02 - 00:42:37 (35 sec),"As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount -- reversing decades of calamitous trade policies."
00:42:37 - 00:43:21 (43 sec),"We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion dollars of Chinese goods -- and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars."
00:43:21 - 00:44:09 (49 sec),"But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us -- I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs."
00:44:09 - 00:44:41 (31 sec),"Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried -- until now."
00:44:41 - 00:46:17 (97 sec),"Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- or USMCA -- will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure."
00:46:17 - 00:47:32 (75 sec),"I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill -- and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs -- and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions."
00:47:32 - 00:48:35 (63 sec),"Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American Patients."
00:48:35 - 00:49:59 (84 sec),"We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American Freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach."
00:49:59 - 00:51:06 (67 sec),"My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Tonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer."
00:51:06 - 00:52:06 (60 sec),"Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10 year old girl, Grace Ee-line. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer."
00:52:06 - 00:53:00 (54 sec),"Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 dollars for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: ""Last day of Keemo."" Grace -- you are an inspiration to us all."
00:53:00 - 00:54:20 (80 sec),"Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask Congress for $500 million dollars over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child."
00:54:20 - 00:55:03 (43 sec),There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth.
00:55:03 - 00:56:01 (58 sec),"These are living, feeling, beautiful, babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb."
00:56:01 - 00:57:08 (67 sec),"Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security. Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military -- with $700 billion dollars last year and $716 billion dollars this year."
00:57:08 - 00:58:19 (71 sec),"We are also getting other nationsto pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO -- but now we have secured a $100 billion dollar increase in defense spending from NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System."
00:58:19 - 00:58:54 (36 sec),"Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms."
00:58:54 - 01:00:03 (69 sec),"That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't -- in which case,we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula."
01:00:03 - 01:00:41 (38 sec),"Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one."
01:00:41 - 01:01:50 (69 sec),"Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Gwydo. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom -- and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair."
01:01:50 - 01:02:36 (46 sec),"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence -- not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
01:02:36 - 01:03:32 (57 sec),"One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism -- not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel -- and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem."
01:03:32 - 01:04:28 (55 sec),"Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American Heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion dollars in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach."
01:04:28 - 01:05:31 (63 sec),"Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home."
01:05:31 - 01:06:37 (66 sec),"I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor -- and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban."
01:06:37 - 01:07:32 (55 sec),"As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people."
01:07:32 - 01:08:23 (51 sec),"18 years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole -- and last month American Forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole."
01:08:23 - 01:09:33 (70 sec),"My administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country."
01:09:33 - 01:10:33 (60 sec),"We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants Death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish People. We must never ignore the vile poison of Anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an Anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh."
01:10:33 - 01:12:02 (88 sec),SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery -- but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.
01:12:02 - 01:13:56 (114 sec),"He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall -- more than 7 decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp."
01:13:56 - 01:15:03 (67 sec),"Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: ""It's the Americans."" A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau [Dah-kow] Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks."
01:15:03 - 01:16:26 (83 sec),"To me, Joshua recalls, ""the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky."" I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchick. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the Beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American Soldiers who helped liberate Dachau [Dah-kow]. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth."
01:16:26 - 01:17:47 (81 sec),"Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight -- seated side-by-side, here in the home of American Freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation. Very much appreciated. Thank you very much. Thank you. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war."
01:17:47 - 01:18:44 (57 sec),"They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America -- they did it for us. Everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before."
01:18:44 - 01:19:41 (57 sec),"Think of this Capitol -- think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure Civil Rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent Republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California."
01:19:41 - 01:20:24 (43 sec),"Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come."
01:20:24 - 01:21:00 (35 sec),We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our inheritance -- or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.
01:21:00 - 01:21:37 (38 sec),"This is the time to re-ignite the American Imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future -- our fate -- and our choice to make."
01:21:37 - 01:22:24 (47 sec),"I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep Freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's Destiny -- that One Nation, Under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world."
01:22:24 - 01:22:45 (21 sec),"Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and Goodnight."
00:00:00 - 00:00:26 (27 sec),"Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, Kevin. Do we love Kevin? Wow, what a job. What a job. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Where is Kevin sitting? He's around here someplace. Kevin, Thank you. Collects so much money. What do you say $23 -- $23 million? That's not bad. I mean, you are the minority, I hate to say."
00:00:26 - 00:00:48 (22 sec),"That's not going to last long, I don't think. That's not going to last long. It was just a brief little spell. You wanted to take a little break. You shouldn't have done it. I told you that. Don't worry, they blame me. I say, ""What the hell did I have to do with it?"" They said, ""Trump wasn't running."" But you know what?"
00:00:48 - 00:01:13 (25 sec),"We're going to do great. I really believe it. We're going to do great. We're going to take the House back. We are. I feel totally confident about that. We're going to watch those vote tallies. You know, I keep hearing about the election and the -- the various counting measures that they have. There were a lot of close elections that were -- they seemed to, every single one of them went Democrat."
00:01:13 - 00:01:35 (21 sec),"If it was close they say, ""The Democrat -- "" Well, there's something going on -- you got to -- hey, you got to be a little bit more paranoid than you are. Okay. Look, all these beautiful people. These beautiful Republican congressmen and women. But we have to be a little bit careful because I don't like the way the votes are being tallied."
00:01:35 - 00:02:07 (32 sec),"I don't like it and you don't like it either. You just don't want to say it because you're afraid of the press. You're afraid of the press. But we have to be careful. And I have to tell you, though, that this is my third one of these and this is really something. It's thrilling to be here tonight with my many great friends and fellow patriots to support incredible Republican members of Congress -- and you are incredible and you've gone through a lot and you're tougher and stronger than ever."
00:02:07 - 00:02:30 (23 sec),"And I'll tell you, I have never been more unified with you than I am right now for some reason. I don't know what it is. It's true. You helped us on the border, which turned out that you're right on that one. That was when it was a little bit less in vogue than it is today. Now everybody's saying, ""I told you there was an emergency."" But you were there right from the beginning."
00:02:30 - 00:02:49 (18 sec),"I appreciate it. I -- I really mean it. I don't think I've ever been closer to you folks, the people in this room, than I am right now, more so than I was even a year ago -- and it was pretty good then, too. But you're fighting every day for our citizens, our safety, our rights, and our God given freedom."
00:02:49 - 00:03:15 (26 sec),"I especially want to thank the rest of this terrific House Republican leadership team, including Republican Whip, the bravest man in this room, a man who played second base in a game where a shot was hit to him. He had zero range. You know, the Yankees had a guy Bobby Richardson, they say he had the widest range of anybody."
00:03:15 - 00:03:41 (26 sec),"He could get a ball anywhere. Go back to shortstop. He was a second baseman. He had the greatest range of everybody. Steve Scalise had the least range of anybody in the history of second base. And I watched that game and I said, ""Oh, my God, look,"" a shot was hit to second. It was hit hard. A really hard ground ball and he got down, he blocked that sucker."
00:03:41 - 00:04:04 (23 sec),"He then picked it up and he threw it to first. I said, ""Is this a movie we're watching?"" The first pitch and Steve Scalise. And let me tell you, Steve Scalise has courage. I was with him that night and his incredible family, his wife, and he wasn't looking so good. And in a short while -- and the doctor said he wasn't looking so good."
00:04:04 - 00:04:45 (41 sec),"It wasn't such a great prognosis. And I'll tell you what, he fights better than anybody and he's my friend and he's your friend. Steve's Scalise. Where is Steve? Where is Steve? Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Steve. Great guy. I'm glad you're on our side, Steve. Okay. And thank you very much and congratulations and to your family."
00:04:45 - 00:05:13 (28 sec),"Amazing what's happened with you. A person who is tough and smart and somebody that fought very hard, loyal. I did something for a man named Scooter Libby, who was not treated fairly in the eyes of many. I've heard this for many years, was not treated fairly. And Liz and her father -- and they came out early for me. Actually, her father came out like almost immediately for me, and it was interesting because I didn't know him."
00:05:13 - 00:05:29 (16 sec),"I liked him, I respected him, but I didn't know him really. But he came out very early. It was a very important moment, actually, for me because who the hell was supporting me? Everyone thought I was just playing games, right? They said, ""He doesn't really mean this. He's just having fun."" You call this fun?"
00:05:29 - 00:05:55 (26 sec),"It's fun. You get phony witch hunts and you get all the others. This is a lot of fun, folks. Have a good time. ""Have a good time, Donald,"" as I wave goodbye to Fifth Avenue. Great time. But I am having a great time because we're doing a lot. We're doing more than anyone's ever done in a short period of time."
00:05:55 - 00:06:21 (26 sec),"We're doing it together. And I am having a good time -- because we're producing for people. But Liz Cheney was so dedicated and -- and the loyalty. That was just an honor for me to do it because we want to take care of our people that got hurt, our people that got wounded. They got wounded. Just like Steve got wounded."
00:06:21 - 00:06:44 (24 sec),"This was a different kind of a wound. And we took care of them. And she was so happy and her father was so happy because they don't forget. Those are good people. So, Liz, thank you very much. Where is Liz? Where is Liz? Thank you, Liz. I mean that, too. Dedicated. It's called loyal people. We like loyal people."
00:06:44 - 00:07:06 (21 sec),"And our -- and our NRCC chair, Tom Emmer. Tom. Thank you, Tom. Great job. I watched him speaking from back, they have a beautiful camera setup and I looked at my people I said, ""This guy's like central casting."" You couldn't pick a better guy in Hollywood. There's no actor that could do it better. Really, thank you, Tom."
00:07:06 - 00:07:28 (22 sec),"Thank you for the great job more importantly. And a special thanks to the chair of this evening's dinner -- and I've agreed to go to the Caterpillar place where they make those beautiful D10s. I said, ""Are they making the D12 yet?"" ""No, they make that in a different location."" I said, ""Well, Darin, I want to go there then."
00:07:28 - 00:08:04 (37 sec),"I want to see what a D12 looks like."" But we're going, no, we're going to Caterpillar. We'll be there soon. And that's a great company and Darin LaHood does a fantastic job of representing that area. They love him. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be there with Darin. I'll be there. Finally, to all of our wonderful supporters here tonight who pour your time, your energy, your resources, and your heart into defending our great nation, your commitment has never been more important than it is right now and we thank you."
00:08:04 - 00:08:26 (21 sec),"And we are, all together, putting America First. Something you haven't heard for many, many decades, America First. We're putting America First. That's what we're doing. And you see that in our deal with China. you're going to see that in a lot of different things. They're all coming online right now. You're seeing it in a lot of different ways."
00:08:26 - 00:08:47 (22 sec),"It's amazing. You know, we ran on a theme, ""Make America Great Again"". And a lot of people are saying that may have been the greatest theme ever in politics. I think it is that. And it wasn't -- Ronald Reagan had a small thing called, ""Let's Make America Great"". That was good. I don't like it as much. And he sure as hell didn't use it as much."
00:08:47 - 00:09:08 (20 sec),"We had -- we've sold millions and millions of hats. Now you go to a rally everybody has the red hat ""Make America Great Again"". Maybe I can have a little help from you. So we have to make a decision pretty soon because we've done a lot for the country. The stock market's up almost 50 percent. We've gotten rid of the great regulations."
00:09:08 - 00:09:34 (26 sec),"Kevin and everybody have told you -- and the great tax cuts with the legendary Kevin Brady and his group. And we've done all of these things. Where is Kevin? I was actually going to introduce him later, but I'll introduce him right now. Where's Kevin? Thank you, Kevin. What a job this man's done. What a job he's done."
00:09:34 - 00:09:58 (25 sec),"Thank you, Kevin. You really have. But we have to make a decision -- the theme for the next campaign. So we've been here by that time three, three and a half years, we're going into the war with some socialists. And it looks like the only non-sort of heavy Socialist he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists."
00:09:58 - 00:10:23 (25 sec),"They got to him. Our former vice president. He's -- I was going to call him, I don't know him well, I was going to say, ""Welcome to the world, Joe. Are you having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?"" But we're going to be running against somebody that's going to go as far left as possible. They're going to go out there."
00:10:23 - 00:10:48 (25 sec),"And so we have to come up -- do we say it seriously, let me know, do we say, ""Keep America Great?"" My theme was going to be ""Keep America Great"" because we've made it great. And we really have. I mean, we -- China is down 38 percent, Kevin, because of tariffs, okay. See, look at Kevin. You're not unhappy about that."
00:10:48 - 00:11:10 (22 sec),"And we're up 50 percent. And the world is not doing well. Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing well. But we're doing well. We're setting records. We should have another record very shortly in the stock market. I think we have 22 Records, 22, where the stock market hit new highs, 22, 100 percent hours."
00:11:10 - 00:11:26 (16 sec),"We have everyone, 22. And now we're going to have another one it looks like. It was looking a little bit bleaker two or three months ago, but that was artificial, it was artificially caused. But it looks like we're going to have some more. We're going to have a lot more. But I have to decide, do we make a change in the theme?"
00:11:26 - 00:12:00 (34 sec),"So you'll tell me because you'll clap. So we have the greatest theme, I think, really of all time, ""Make America Great Again. ""MAGA"". ""MAGA"". ""MAGA Country"", right? MAGA County. How about the guy from Chicago? The actor that nobody ever heard of, nobody ever -- I said, ""Who the hell is that?"" He said, ""He got taken out by MAGA Country."" I said, ""What the hell was that?"" I guess that's a hate crime, right?"
00:12:00 - 00:12:25 (26 sec),"He got taken out by MAGA Country. But we have ""MAGA"" and we do have ""MAGA Country"". We have people that are so in love with us. We have the greatest base, I believe, in the history of politics or I wouldn't be here. With all the things I've done they never wavered. They never wavered. Can you believe? Anybody else they'd be down to 2 percent right now, and we just had our best -- we just had 51 percent and 54 percent."
00:12:25 - 00:12:57 (31 sec),"And they say you can add 10 percent -- because 10 percent of the people love us, but they're ashamed to say, ""That I'm voting for the president."" I don't care, they're ashamed. And I said, ""Am I supposed to like that?"" I do. We'll take it any way we can get it, right, fellas? Anyway, we can get it. Actually in the one poll, and we have some great pollsters unless it work for CNN, that -- those are -- that's fake news."
00:12:57 - 00:13:24 (27 sec),"You know, polls can be fake news, too. But we have one poll where the pollster said, ""Anybody that says, 'I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to tell you. I don't want to even discuss it -- '"" And they also added another two words, when they call up and they say these two horrible words -- anybody in that category it's a 100 percent vote for Trump."
00:13:24 - 00:13:45 (21 sec),"And what they've done is they don't count that. But now this one counts that, it's 100 percent. We're going to have a great election. The question is, do I go with ""Make America Great Again"" or do I go with ""Keep America Great"" because we made it great in theory. So are you ready? Let's go. Let me hear it. And -- and it is hard."
00:13:45 - 00:14:04 (18 sec),"You know, I was seeing the other day, they were saying it's -- it's probably the greatest theme in the history of politics. I think it is, ""Make America Great Again, MAGA"". How do you give that up for a new one? ""KAG"". ""KAG"". ""Keep America Great. KAG"". I don't know. Maybe it catches on. You never know. You know what?"
00:14:04 - 00:14:42 (38 sec),"First with MAGA I never thought MAGA was going to catch on. And now MAGA, everything's MAGA. I even say just whenever I do a tweet, that's -- boy that has kept us in business, those tweets, huh? Haven't they? It's my only form of defense because the press is 94 percent against us, 94 percent. So, who likes ""Make America Great Again""? And you people are pros, most of you, not all of you."
00:14:42 - 00:15:25 (43 sec),"I see a couple of people I know they have not done well in this business. In fact, they're sitting outside of those doors trying to get in. Who likes ""Keep America Great""? Okay, so ready? ""Make America Great Again"". Or ""Keep America Great"". I don't know. It's -- it's, honestly, I love the idea of ""Keep America Great"" because you know what it says is we've made it great now we're going to keep it great because the Socialists will destroy it. You know, we're doing great but they can destroy what we've done with the steel industry."
00:15:25 - 00:15:49 (24 sec),"Look at what's going on with the steel industry in your district, also, by the way, along with Caterpillar, they're building steel mills, 38 steel mills all over the land, renovation and -- and a lot of new ones. A lot of new ones. Because we decided to put the tariffs on dumped steel, mostly from China, what it's done is beyond anybody's -- it's like one of the hot -- hot things."
00:15:49 - 00:16:06 (17 sec),"And by the way, this country needs steel. We've got to have steel. You know, there are certain things you don't have to have, like, you know, making the suit, you don't have to have, you have to have steel. We need it for defense. You have to have aluminum. And it's incredible what happened to those industries."
00:16:06 - 00:16:26 (20 sec),"So we will make the determination. And honestly, I get a good vibe on both, to be honest. I love the concept. We made it great and now we're going to keep it great, but I hate the concept of throwing away the most successful theme, I think, probably in the history politics. I mean, there's something a little stupid about that, right?"
00:16:26 - 00:16:48 (22 sec),"Let's take MAGA and throw it out. So I have a feeling we maybe we'll try and use both. How about that? We'll try and use both because they're both good. You know. Hillary had a thing like ""Stay Together"" or some crap like that. I think she paid $1.9 million for the genius that gave her the line. I can honestly tell you I didn't pay."
00:16:48 - 00:17:11 (23 sec),"That was made up by me. That was made up by me. But they paid a lot of money. And then the first night, remember, we said, ""It's all about her,"" and then changed the theme the next morning. So that didn't work out too well. Her theme wasn't too good. It wasn't a success. But after two years of Republican leadership, and -- and I have to tell you, we are truly winning again."
00:17:11 - 00:17:35 (24 sec),"Our country is winning again and our country is respected again. And it's, I say, respected like rarely before and we're hitting a new mark. But I say it's respected like rarely before. And with your help, we're restoring the bonds of loyalty and trust between our citizens and their government and we're returning power to where it belongs, with the American people."
00:17:35 - 00:18:09 (35 sec),"To liberate our citizens from bureaucracy we've slashed almost 30,000 pages of job killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record no matter how long a president was in office. Let me see what I look like, huh? Good. I don't see much of a bald spot there. I'm very -- I'm always afraid to look in those cameras."
00:18:09 - 00:18:30 (21 sec),"And again, I want to thank -- and -- and he is a special man. He's a friend of mine, but -- And I introduced him a little earlier, but I'm going to introduce them again because Kevin Brady, and so many of the other fantastic Republicans that passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country and they're for the working families."
00:18:30 - 00:18:52 (22 sec),"We don't get credit for the working families part, but it's the largest tax cuts. And businesses are flowing back into our country because of those tax cuts and because of regulation cuts. So Kevin, again, thank you very much. Really an incredible job. Thank you to everybody that worked with all of us, you know that right?"
00:18:52 - 00:19:14 (22 sec),"We doubled the Child Tax Credit and we virtually ended the unfair Estate Tax, also known as the Death Tax on small businesses and farms. I tell people when I'm in farm country, I said, ""You know, now if you have a farm -- ,"" they used to leave it and the kids would have to go out and borrow a lot of money because they make an income but it's hard."
00:19:14 - 00:19:33 (19 sec),The land is sometimes worth more than the income. And they go borrow money at the end up losing it to a bank a couple of years later. It's -- -not going to be worried about any longer. Now they don't have the Death Tax. They don't have what's known as the Estate Tax. We got rid of it. Kevin did that with a whole group of very good people.
00:19:33 - 00:19:57 (24 sec),"And that's a big deal. That's a big deal. People are very happy. I always say, jokingly, ""So now if you love your children you can leave your farm or your small business to your children and they don't have to go borrow money and take a risk. If you don't leave your children -- if you don't love them, if you don't just really love them it doesn't matter because you're not going to leave it to them anyway."
00:19:57 - 00:20:22 (25 sec),"So this tax doesn't mean a damn thing. This tax won't help you much."" But most of them leave it to their children, I guess. To bring back American jobs we slashed the business tax rate down from one of the highest anywhere in the developed world, down to a number that nobody believed that we could get down to. We were at, if you really add it up, we were over 40 percent."
00:20:22 - 00:20:46 (25 sec),"It was an impossible situation. And you know, so many things are in that deal like bringing back money. Billions and billions of dollars is pouring back into a country that could not get back here. It was impossible, not only because of the high tax rates, nobody would bring it back -- over 40 percent, but also because of the bureaucracy which we killed in our tax plan."
00:20:46 - 00:21:10 (24 sec),"So billions of dollars. Apple recently announced $230 billion is going to be brought back into our country from overseas that they would never have even thought of bringing back and they're going to spend it building new facilities here. That's a lot, $230 billion. And we're fixing broken trade deals to protect the American workers."
00:21:10 - 00:21:29 (19 sec),"And we are standing up to China's chronic trading abuses and theft of intellectual properties and so many other things that they've done to us. I don't know how you people allowed this to happen for so many years. You've been here longer than me. But they really have, they've taken advantage of our country."
00:21:29 - 00:21:49 (20 sec),"And you know what? I respect them for it. I say it. We should have been doing that to them. I was in China making a speech. President Xi, who is a strong man, I call him King, he said, ""But I am not King, I am president."" I said, ""No, you're president for life and therefore, you're King."" He said, ""Huh. Huh."" He liked that."
00:21:49 - 00:22:11 (22 sec),"So I call him King. I get along with them great. But I was really hitting him hard about how they've hurt our country. And I had 5,000 Chinese people, I'm China, I'm in Beijing doing this, can you believe it? And I'm looking down, he's getting angrier and angrier. And then I saved it. I said, ""You know, I don't blame you."
00:22:11 - 00:22:38 (27 sec),"I blame the leaders of our country for allowing it to happen."" And it's really true. We should never have allowed that to happen. And we're getting a lot of it back. You're going to see it. And your farmers, all of you representing farm territory -- You know, I was with the Vice Premier about two weeks ago, and I said, ""You got to do me a favor of goodwill,"" because we have such a strong country right now, economically, stronger than anybody by far."
00:22:38 - 00:22:55 (17 sec),"You know, they were catching us. They would have -- they would have caught us within a short period of time. They we're catching us. Within two years, by the end of my term, if you had a normal president, I don't want to say that negatively, I think I'm very normal, but if you had a normal -- you know what I mean."
00:22:55 - 00:23:16 (21 sec),"In other words, if you had a stiff as president -- which most of them are, I hate to say -- they would have caught us. But right now it's going to be a long time before they catch us. A long time. I told you, they're down 38 percent, we're up 50 percent. That made a lot of difference. It's like day and night."
00:23:16 - 00:23:44 (28 sec),"But we really have to be strong with these nations because these nations are taking advantage, not just China, everybody has a trade surplus on us -- almost every nation in the world. When I took over we lost eight -- I said, ""How are we doing on trade? I want to break down,"" my first meeting. They said, ""Sir, we're down $807 billion."" I said, ""You got to be kidding?"" No, seriously, I thought they were joking, right?"
00:23:44 - 00:24:08 (24 sec),"We were down $807. We're losing over $800 billion in trade. We're starting to turn it. We have the USMCA. I hope you guys can get it approved. I mean, the problem we have -- is that you have a very hostile group. You have a very, very hostile group on the other side, and they don't want to see us have success and the USMCA is a great deal."
00:24:08 - 00:24:30 (22 sec),"It's great. Again, I said, ""If you don't do this we're going to tariff every product coming out of your country at 25 percent."" And every time I had a problem I would just take -- you know, especially cars. I had a little plastic car on my desk and I'd have the leaders come over and I just take the car out, put it on the front of the desk, they say, ""Okay, we agree."" Because the big thing is the cars."
00:24:30 - 00:24:55 (25 sec),"Canada's sending us tremendous numbers of cars. They're practically un-taxed, and yet they don't take our agricultural product, in many cases, and in many cases they charge 297 percent tariffs and it's very unfair. Canada's very, very tough. You know, we love Canada. We think of the beautiful song and the ice hockey games, Oh, Canada, isn't it beautiful?"
00:24:55 - 00:25:23 (28 sec),"But in the meantime, they knock the hell out of us on trade and they have been doing it for a long time. And they're very tough. And they're not at all nice about that situation. But we've made them nice. We've made them nice. And they're not happy about what happened. But our farmers are going to be able to sell now into Canada, which they were restricted from doing and -- and they're going to be able to sell into a lot of places."
00:25:23 - 00:25:50 (27 sec),"And the Vice Premier said when I said, ""Give us a token of affection."" He said, ""We will immediately by 10 million tons of soybeans."" And I looked at Sonny Perdue, who's doing a fantastic job, as you know, Secretary of Agriculture -- I said, ""Sonny, is 10 million tons of soybeans a lot? It sounds -- "" He said, ""That's a lot."" And they started buying 10 million."
00:25:50 - 00:26:22 (32 sec),"So the farmers are so incredible -- and I saw them interviewed last week. They had a couple of farmers on. We love the farmers. I'll tell you. I'm never going to forget the farmers. They -- they sort of got me here, wouldn't you think? And they said, ""Well, you know -- "" because China and various of these countries that were rightfully doing numbers on them because we have no choice what they've done to us. But they're going to start buying at numbers that you've never seen before."
00:26:22 - 00:26:43 (21 sec),"But farmers said, ""We know how badly China has taken advantage of this country. And we may be getting a little bit hurt right now but we're with the president all the way."" They have every single farmer, every person I've seen they have these focus groups, every farmer has said the same thing. And you know, the amazing thing about farmers?"
00:26:43 - 00:27:08 (25 sec),"We had a little bit of a soft patch and I called in a group of 15 or 20 representative farmers and I wanted to give them help, I wanted to give them aid. And they looked at me and said, ""We don't want aid. We don't want it."" And I said, ""What do you mean?"" Because I'm so used to having people come in, wanting help, wanting aid, wanting whatever it is they want."
00:27:08 - 00:27:30 (21 sec),"And these people didn't want it. They just wanted me to make a fair platform. And I said, ""I'll never forget this meeting. I will never forget it,"" because again, I meet with a lot of different groups and they're always asking for an advantage. Okay, I'm not blaming anybody. These farmers didn't want it. They said, ""We don't want that, sir."
00:27:30 - 00:27:51 (22 sec),"We don't want any help. We just want a -- really a level playing field."" I thought it was incredible. I've told that story so many times. So we love our farmers. Let them know we're very close, because you are going to have -- In fact, when I asked China -- and I'm doing that, that'll be the end of the -- if we get there and you know, let's see what happens."
00:27:51 - 00:28:14 (22 sec),"Who knows? I think we're doing very well. They need the deal more than we do. You see what's -- they need the deal. And they getting hurt badly with the -- you know, they're paying 25 percent on $50 billion worth of technology stuff and they were going to pay 25 percent on another $200 billion. But I started them at $10 because I'm nice."
00:28:14 - 00:28:52 (38 sec),"And then we were dealing well, this was three, four weeks ago. You remember. And they said, ""Would it be possible for you not to raise the 10 percent to 25 percent?"" which would automatically kick in? I said, ""Yes,"" because you know it's a little hard to negotiate with them when we start raising it. But after that, they have $340 billion left that I haven't even text and their bullets are gone because we do $600 billion worth of purchases from them, and they do $97 billion worth of purchases from us. Not exactly great."
00:28:52 - 00:29:16 (25 sec),"But now they were paying for that. And they were paying big. One thing, as an example, on cars, if they sold a car to us we bring it in for no tax. It's 2.5 percent, but basically, when you do certain paperwork and check the wrong boxes you pay nothing. It's stupid. When we buy a car from them, and we buy a lot of them, believe it or not, it's a 40 percent tax."
00:29:16 - 00:29:34 (18 sec),"So they get 40 percent, we get nothing, other than that it's been a very good deal. I get a call two months ago, toward the beginning of the negotiation, that they're bringing the 40 percent down to 15 percent. I said, ""That's good, but it's still not zero. It's still not what we have."" You know, it's good."
00:29:34 - 00:29:54 (20 sec),"I'm not thrilled. I got a call from -- and but that's coming down. It's all coming down. I got a call from Prime Minister Modi of India. They're one of the highest taxing nations in the world. They taxed us 100 percent. Look, he's nodding, you know what I'm talking about. They charge us 100 percent tariffs on goods."
00:29:54 - 00:30:20 (26 sec),"So they send a motorcycle -- and they make a lot of them -- Indian cycles. They send them to our country, we charge them nothing. We send a Harley Davidson to India and they charge us 100 percent. Not fair, okay. Not reciprocal. It's not fair. And for those of you, like Sean, and like -- where's Sean? Where the hell is my guy from Wisconsin?"
00:30:20 - 00:30:56 (37 sec),"He's so great. Where is he? This guy's a champion. Him and where's Jim? 128 -- 128 and 1. Where the hell is Jim Jordan? Where the hell is he? Is he here? 128. Where is he? This guy, NCAA, What a lousy location. Holy -- are you kidding me? Wait, stand up again. I can't see you. It's too far away. I can't believe it. Wow, Jim, I've just lost all respect for Jim."
00:30:56 - 00:31:17 (20 sec),"That's it. One hundred twenty eight and one in wrestling, NCAA Wrestling Champion. And you know when you're that -- when you're that good, don't kid yourself, folks. A lot of us up here, not just here, a lot of it's right up here. And he's a warrior and Sean's a warrior. And Sean now is working on the Reciprocal Trade Act."
00:31:17 - 00:31:40 (23 sec),"If they charge us, we charge them, very simple. They charge us, we charge them. And I think you're doing great on it, Sean, and I appreciate it, man. Great job. But he's the tree climbing, you know, these characters to go up the trees then they come down. He said, ""No, going up isn't the hard part, it's coming down because if you miss you're dead."" And he said he's missed about four times."
00:31:40 - 00:32:04 (25 sec),"But he's a five time world champion going up a tree. Did anybody know that? See, to me that means something because being a champion is something -- And that's one that is tough stuff and dangerous stuff. So listen, I appreciate your help, Sean. It's incredible. That's incredible. I'm still more impressed with a championship stuff, but that's -- So we've ended the war on American energy."
00:32:04 - 00:32:31 (26 sec),"The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And that all happened over the last two years. Big difference. Hillary wanted to put up wind. Wind. If you -- if you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value."
00:32:31 - 00:32:55 (25 sec),"And they say the noise causes cancer. You told me that one. Okay. You know, the thing makes it -- it's so -- And of course, it's like a graveyard for birds. If you love birds you'd never want to walk under a windmill because it's a very sad, sad sight. It's like a cemetery. We put a little -- we put a little statue for the poor birds."
00:32:55 - 00:33:25 (30 sec),"It's true. You know, in California, if you shoot a Bald Eagle they put you in jail for five years and yet, the windmills wipe them all out. It's true. They wipe them out. It's terrible. And I told the other day at CPAC, great people at CPAC. We had an incredible thing. I had nothing to do. It was early on a Saturday morning I had just gotten back from dealing with Kim Jong-un. We had to walk."
00:33:25 - 00:33:42 (17 sec),"He wasn't ready for deal. That's okay, because we get along great. He wasn't ready. I told him, ""You're not ready for a deal."" That's the first time anybody has ever told him that and left. It's never happened to him before. Nobody's ever left. But I said, ""You're not ready for a deal, but we'll make it deal."" We have a good relationship."
00:33:42 - 00:34:09 (27 sec),"We have a good relationship. But I told a story about CPAC, the woman, she wants to watch television and she says to her husband, ""Is the wind blowing? I'd love to watch your show tonight, darling. The wind hasn't blown for three days. I can't watch television, darling. Darling, please tell the wind to blow."" No, wind's not so good."
00:34:09 - 00:34:25 (16 sec),"And you know, you have no idea how expensive it is to make those things. They're all made in China and Germany, by the way, just in case you -- We don't make them here, essentially. We don't make them here. And by the way, the carbon and all of the things flying up in the air, you know, the carbon footprint?"
00:34:25 - 00:34:54 (29 sec),"President Obama used to talk about the carbon footprint and he'd hop on Air Force One, a big 747 with very old engines, and he'd fly to Hawaii to play a round of golf. Now, you tell me, the carbon footprint. But that's the way it is. We have the greatest energy in the world. They wanted to take it away from us. They don't like that we have it. We've really discovered it over the last very short period of time."
00:34:54 - 00:35:15 (21 sec),"I've made it readily accessible. We're approving pipelines in Texas that would have taken 20 years. I'm getting them done in about six months. You guys all know that the Texas guys. And by the way, if they're not good, if there's something wrong, if it's going to hurt our water, if it's going to hurt our air, if it's going to -- we're not going to approve them."
00:35:15 - 00:35:34 (19 sec),"But you're going to know in 12 months instead of in 20 years, at the end of 20 years you start off as a young man or woman and now you're getting ready to retire and they're getting ready to vote on your project, right, whatever the hell it may be. You know, highways, Elaine Chao is doing a great job, by the way, as our Secretary."
00:35:34 - 00:35:56 (22 sec),"Great job. But highways, in many cases, would take 20 or 21 years to get approved. Think of it. In some cases, not even a highway, it's like a roadway. And I have a down now to two years. We got rid of so much of the waste and the stupidity. And you know, a lot of this happened because of consultants, environmental engineers, they call themselves."
00:35:56 - 00:36:17 (22 sec),"I have -- I've heard many of them. I've lost plenty of money with those guys. And I used to see him up at Albany. I'd say, ""How come you're here? Why are you here? You represent me. Why are you here?"" They're trying to get a bill passed that makes it harder to get permits and my guy is there trying to get the bill because I have to pay them more money that way, my consultant."
00:36:17 - 00:36:47 (30 sec),"So we took down highways from, in many cases 20 years, till probably -- we want to get it down to one year and then maybe get rejected but you'll get it rejected quickly. You're going to know. It's like Jack Nicklaus is a friend of mine. He said standing over a four foot putt, he never missed them, but he told me Chichi Rodriguez, great putter, he get up, he was a character and he'd just putt."
00:36:47 - 00:37:06 (19 sec),"Get up, bing. Get up, bing. It wouldn't take any time. Get up, bing. He had an expression, ""Miss it quick."" You ever hear that expression? He was a character. ""Miss it quick."" I'd get up, ""Miss it quick."" But he didn't miss too many. But that's what we're doing. We're going to make sure that you get it and if it doesn't work we're going to let you know."
00:37:06 - 00:37:36 (30 sec),"There was a highway, a small highway in a state where some friends are in this room. It is 21 years. It was going to cost $5 million 21 years ago. Now it's going to cost $900 million and it took 21 years to get it approved. And it used to be a straight line. Right? So if somebody's a little tipsy, they had too many drinks, which is a bad thing, at least they could drive straight."
00:37:36 - 00:38:03 (27 sec),"Now in order to get away from nesting turtles, rattlesnakes, and everything else, that highway is the craziest looking sucker you've ever seen. It's twice as long as it was supposed to be. My father and I would have designed it a straight path, point to point, right? And but it took -- and it cost, you know, I mean, literally, almost hundreds of times more than it was supposed to cost."
00:38:03 - 00:38:24 (20 sec),"And it's dangerous. People are running into the -- they don't know how, but they're running into things that they're not supposed to. So we're straightening things out. There are many, many stories like that. The great aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, I go to see it and the catapult system, you know, the catapult, that's what's throws the plane off."
00:38:24 - 00:38:47 (23 sec),"So the aircraft carrier, there's a slight problem. It was supposed to cost $3 billion. It ended up costing about $16 billion right now. It wasn't on my watch. But it's getting close. The President Gerald Ford. Big. The largest ship ever built they say. It's a massive ship. So I get on there but they're having trouble with the catapult system because it used to be steam."
00:38:47 - 00:39:13 (25 sec),"You've seen it where the planes go off steam, old-fashioned, right? Old-fashioned. So they've decided to go magnetic -- never been done before -- and electronic. So it's very, very complex. They have these brilliant guys from MIT, where my uncle was a professor, by the way, for 40 years, brilliant guy, Dr. John Trump."
00:39:13 - 00:39:45 (33 sec),"A lot of people find it hard to believe that I had a professor -- one of the smartest people in the history of MIT, in my blood. You'd be surprised. A lot of things are surprising in life. But you have to go to MIT to figure out how this damn thing works. So I get to the boat. ""How's it going?"" ""Well, it's okay, sir, but we're having a little problem with the catapult system."" You know, that's not like so good."
00:39:45 - 00:40:21 (36 sec),"I mean, we have an aircraft carrier and you can't send planes off the damn thing. Historically, that has not proven to be a good thing for aircraft carriers. So -- so I said, ""Let me see -- "" I didn't want to see the admirals. You get tired of the admirals because this was a problem. I said,"" Let me see the catapult people."" They said, ""Sir, you don't really want to do that."" I said, ""Yeah, those are the people that know what the hell they're doing."" This thing is $900 million over budget to throw the planes off."
00:40:21 - 00:40:51 (30 sec),"And we could have had steam and it would have been done and we would have saved hundreds of millions of dollars. So I get the catapult guys, five guys come over. ""Yes, sir."" ""What do you do?"" ""Sir, I've been a catapulter. By the way, he's more proud of being a catapulter than Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady, and all of you big, high ranking Republicans are doing what the hell -- They -- they would be so bored doing what you're doing."
00:40:51 - 00:41:22 (31 sec),"Dealing with Democrats all day. That's not fun. But I said, ""So what do you do?"" He said, ""I'm a catapulter, 20 years. Yes, sir. What would you like to know, sir?"" ""Very simple question. What's better, an electric catapult or steam?"" ""Sir, steam is better."" I said, ""It's better."" I said, ""Why is it better?"" ""Well, for one thing the electric goes faster, sir."
00:41:22 - 00:41:49 (27 sec),"But it takes you two and a half minutes to bring the plane to the site. No matter what you do it's still the same two and a half. So we don't have to send the plane off every second. By the time the steam builds up we have plenty of time left. That's number one, sir. I can give you 10 other reasons but another one, sir, if the steam breaks I can fix it myself with a wrench."
00:41:49 - 00:42:10 (21 sec),"If the electronics breaks, sir, we have to send for Albert Einstein -- to try and fix it. We can't figure this damn thing out."" I never saw -- this is what happens. This is what happens. This is what happens. I hate to say it, when they make airplanes so damn complex that pilots can't fly him this is what happens."
00:42:10 - 00:42:33 (23 sec),"Now, up to a point you want to go. But we have to be careful. We're spending money on things and it's almost like they do it just to do it. And we want to be careful. We want to be smart. So we're getting that problem fixed, but it's a hell of a problem. We've confirmed 53 District Court Judges and 37 Circuit Court Judges -- who are going to interpret the Constitution as written."
00:42:33 - 00:42:52 (20 sec),"Anybody not like that here? Not too many people in this room. I can tell you a lot of people in another room across the way. Along with two outstanding Supreme Court Judges, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and as you know, Brett Kavanaugh -- who was put through a grinder like nobody has ever been put through a grinder."
00:42:52 - 00:43:17 (25 sec),"That was so unfair. That was so unfair. And Congress passed, and I'm very proud of this -- where's Greg? Greg. Greg, where are you? We worked hard on this. Greg. Greg. Right. You know what I'm going to say, Greg, because this is a great thing and I hope nobody in this room has to do it. But you know, Right to Choose."
00:43:17 - 00:43:47 (30 sec),"Right. Right. We have a right, a right. And we did something else with Greg and with everybody, we passed Choice for our military, Choice. So we have in one case, Choice, we have another, Right To Try. And I don't know if the people know what even Right To Try -- I kept saying to myself, as I was a civilian -- you don't want to use it. You don't want to use it. But I've had friends over the years, they're very ill, terminally ill."
00:43:47 - 00:44:10 (23 sec),"And if they have money they travel all over the world looking for a cure. If they don't have money they go home and there's nothing they can do. And Right To Try, which Greg and everybody was so incredible with, and we got it done, right? That was an easy. You'd think it was easy. But you know, the country had a problem because they didn't want to be sued if it doesn't work."
00:44:10 - 00:44:41 (30 sec),"The insurance companies had a problem. The drug companies had a problem because they didn't want it on their record. So we said, ""Well, I'll tell you what, we won't put these people that are so terminally ill, so sick, we won't put them on the record."" They said, ""We like that. We have a separate category."
00:44:41 - 00:45:19 (39 sec),"We like that."" And then the insurance companies had a tremendous problem. But the country did too, so I said, ""Here's what we do, they have to sign a document that exculps, that gets rid of all liability to our country. Because you know, they don't make it and then they sue our country. And I could never understand why they didn't get this passed because the law was we don't want to hurt people."
00:45:19 - 00:45:59 (40 sec),"So we don't want to give them a cure. We don't want to hurt people. And I'll tell you what, and for all of the people in this room, and every one of you who's here, you can feel proud because we have had such success. We have saved lives already and this is only seven months ago that we signed it. We've saved lives already with people going -- and what it does, is it really does, I mean, it's the ultimate test for a drug or for a possible cure."
00:45:59 - 00:46:28 (29 sec),"What's better than this? It's been a tremendous success and we got it done. It's something nobody talks about, but it's something that a lot of people respect -- and it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy. So thank you, Greg. That was a great job on that. And we pass VA Accountability. So not only VA Choice. VA Choice."
00:46:28 - 00:47:00 (32 sec),"They're standing in line for weeks and weeks in many cases, weeks and weeks, think of it. And now, rather -- these are great veterans. They stand on line, and now they go, they see a doctor, we pay for it. It doesn't matter. Number one, we do save money. It doesn't matter. We're saving lives. People are ill."
00:47:00 - 00:47:15 (16 sec),"By the time they get to the doctor they are terminally ill. And we're saving lives. But we also have done so many other things for our veterans. And if you notice, there's not a lot of complaints coming out of the VA for the first time. How long has it been since you've seen a VA that's really been well run?"
00:47:15 - 00:47:33 (18 sec),"They're doing a phenomenal job. But Accountability is great, where if they treat our veterans badly -- we have now Accountability. We say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired."" We fire them. You couldn't fire him. They could steal. They could be sadists. They were sadists. They were hurting our veterans."
00:47:33 - 00:47:59 (26 sec),"We couldn't do anything about it. And we also passed, just now, some of you in the room were there with me, a little while ago, criminal justice reform. And I'll tell you, a lot of people are very happy about that. A lot of people. And thanks to our bold agenda, we enacted with House Republicans, America now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
00:47:59 - 00:48:34 (35 sec),"We're the hottest in the world. Wherever I meet a president, a prime minister, anybody, they say, ""Congratulations on your economy."" And since our election, we've created more than 5.3 million new jobs, including half a million jobs and that number is going up to about 618,000 jobs very soon, these are manufacturing jobs that President Obama said will never happen."
00:48:34 - 00:48:58 (24 sec),"""You'd need a magic wand. It's not going to happen. Well, it's happening. We have the magic wand. And more than five million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps because we have jobs, now. Think of that. The numbers are staggering, five million off of foods. And after years of stagnation wages are rising fast and the lowest paid workers are making the biggest gains."
00:48:58 - 00:49:30 (32 sec),"We've done more things than we promised. Many more things. Like this one, African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment, and you know this because you've heard me say it and other people say it, and veteran unemployment, that's a great one, have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:49:30 - 00:49:59 (29 sec),"I mean, how do you beat that? When they talk about African American and what they want to do, I say, ""Well, I have not much to say, except that we've just hit the absolute lowest unemployment rate for African Americans in the history of our country. That's all I have to say. Goodbye, everybody."" We won the debate, right?"
00:49:59 - 00:50:21 (22 sec),"We won the debate. It should be easy. It will be interesting to see. But don't underestimate the power of Socialism to get a vote. It's what happens over a 10-year period when the country is destroyed -- but they don't care about that. When they say, ""We're going to give you a free education. We're going to give you free health care."
00:50:21 - 00:50:45 (24 sec),"We're going to not have you pay your loans for college. We're going to give you free everything. Everything is free,"" it's very seductive to people. It's not going to be so easy like you think. Now, in 10 years it's going to be easy when the country goes to hell because that's what happens, the country goes to hell."
00:50:45 - 00:51:12 (27 sec),"It happened many times. Look at Venezuela. I mean, this was the richest country in that whole -- I mean, outside of us, it was one of the richest countries in the world and now they have no food, they have no electric, they have nothing. It's sad. And that's Socialism. But when you're standing up on a stage, and a guy said, ""We're going to wipe out all costs for education."
00:51:12 - 00:51:40 (29 sec),"We're going to wipe out all healthcare. We're going to give you single payer."" They don't say that you're going to wipe out 180 private plans that people love. But it's not as easy as people think. People think it's easy. It is easy in 10 years, it's not easy now, because a lot of folks are going to say, ""Hey, wait a minute, man, if I vote for Trump, I agree the economy is good, but this guy's giving me everything."" Not that easy."
00:51:40 - 00:52:04 (23 sec),"So we have to work. We can never take it for granted. We have to explain how bad it really is. We have to do that. But this is a time of extraordinary opportunity for our nation, extraordinary. That's why, in my State of the Union Address, I asked new Democrat majority in the House to work with us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure."
00:52:04 - 00:52:22 (19 sec),"And I think we're going to have something, maybe, we could do it bipartisan there, bring down the cost of healthcare, and bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Bring down the cost. Thank you. I love that you're clapping for that because we have to talk quickly about health care to have this power in this room."
00:52:22 - 00:52:49 (27 sec),"How often do you get that? And we are going to finally secure our nation's borders. It's happening right now. And I said to Mexico last week -- you know, they have the strongest immigration laws in the world. They don't have judges. Somebody gets on their land, they say, ""Get out of here, now."" Somebody touches our land, we bring them into court, you need Perry Mason to represent them."
00:52:49 - 00:53:09 (20 sec),"They're here for years. They never come back for the trial. They say, ""Let's bring them into court. We'll bring them in. Well, you just stepped on a property. Bring them in. Be gentle. Bring them into court."" And it's called Catch and Release. It may be the dumbest program in the history of the world. You catch them and you release them."
00:53:09 - 00:53:28 (19 sec),"Oh, wonderful. We've done a great job. And then, ""You're going to come back, sir, in four years from now. January 14th, you're going to come back and we're going to give you a trial to see whether or not you can stay. But in the meantime, we're releasing you into our country."" Now, only two percent come back for the trial."
00:53:28 - 00:53:49 (21 sec),"Okay. And those are not the smartest ones, to be honest with you. The ones that come back or not the smartest ones. The 98 percent are much more than the two percent that come back. It's terrible. But I said to Mexico, ""Listen, you have the strongest immigration."" They don't have courts. They don't have Catch and Release."
00:53:49 - 00:54:10 (21 sec),"They don't have Chain Migration. They don't have Visa Lottery, a lottery. You pick a lottery. ""Oh, you're going to the United States. Congratulations."" The country does this. Do you think they put their best people in those lotteries? What the hell were you people thinking when you approved these deals? They say in all fairness, it is purely -- that's a Chuck Schumer deal."
00:54:10 - 00:54:31 (21 sec),"That was when they had enough muscle. They got this stuff passed. It's incredible. Think of it. They put names and you pick a name. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to announce so and so,"" I don't want to use names because I'll get in trouble because it's always somebody going to leak this whole damn speech to the media -- to the Fake News so I won't use the name that I'm thinking about."
00:54:31 - 00:54:57 (25 sec),"Congratulations. And then you find out he's a stone cold killer, served many years in -- These are the people they give us. What do you think? Do you think they're going to give us their finest? They don't give us -- and we take them in, ""Congratulations."" Crazy CNN, they had a reporter, they're walking up -- I mean, how bad -- I mean, how bad."
00:54:57 - 00:55:17 (21 sec),"Now they're saying, ""We were never against him with respect to collusion. We were just reporting the news."" Did you see that? That's their new theory? You know, that they weren't -- in other words, that they will fair. Yeah, they were fair. But they're interviewing this group of people, ""And what are you coming to the United States for?"" A woman says, ""Well, I'm coming for my daughter."" ""Okay, that's fair."
00:55:17 - 00:55:45 (27 sec),"What are you coming -- "" Then they go to this man, a little rough looking, ""And what are you coming for?"" ""Asylum."" ""Ah. Why?"" ""I murdered someone."" ""Oh."" The woman goes like, ""What? You murdered."" Did anybody see that? ""I murdered someone,"" he said. Right? You saw it. And she's like, ""Oh, man. Okay, back to headquarters, please."" You know, because they're trying to say how good everybody is, that these are wonderful people."
00:55:45 - 00:56:19 (35 sec),"And some of them are wonderful people. Remember when I made my first feature in Trump Tower coming down the escalator with our great First Lady that everybody loves? Everybody loves our First Lady. And I talked about different things. And I mentioned the word rape. And everybody thought it was a great speech and then about two days later, it was like sort of a delayed reaction, two days later, they said, ""He said rape! He said all sorts of -- "" Let me tell you, and I took heat."
00:56:19 - 00:56:43 (24 sec),"Do you remember the first six months? Man were they killing me in that speech. It went from being a great speech to being a disaster. And now you look at that speech and you see what's happening and that speech was so tame compared to what really is happening. That trek up from Guatemala, and Honduras, and El Salvador, it's one of the great, dangerous treks anywhere."
00:56:43 - 00:57:13 (30 sec),"And Mexico has now, because they don't want the border closed, because Mexico makes a hell of a lot of money off us. They took 30 percent of our car business. I wasn't here. The new USMCA will stop that. No more car companies are going to Mexico when they sign this deal. No more car companies. That was the most important thing for me. So now, Mexico, I said I'm closing it and I really wanted to close it, but now Mexico is saying, ""No, no, no."" The first time in decades."
00:57:13 - 00:57:32 (19 sec),"We will not let anybody get through. And they've apprehended over 1,000 people today at the -- at the Southern border, their Southern border, and they're bringing it back into their country. I said, ""Why the hell didn't somebody do that in the first place?"" But they don't want the border closed. And you know who else doesn't want the border closed, the Democrats?"
00:57:32 - 00:58:02 (30 sec),"They don't want the border closed. And I agree, it's going to be a big toll. But trade, and commerce, and making money for our country, it's all very important, but to me the most important job I have is the security of our country, even more important than those other things that I talk about all the time -- it's the security of our country."
00:58:02 - 00:58:28 (25 sec),"Instead of choosing greatness for America, House Democrats responded with radicalism, resistance. ""Resist"", that's their theme. ""Make America Great Again"" is ours, theirs is ""Resist"". You don't know what the hell they're resisting. They go around saying, ""Resist,"" and they do resist. Revenge, crazy hoaxes like we just went through, and ridiculous conspiracy theories."
00:58:28 - 00:59:12 (44 sec),"We have -- just incredible when you see what is coming out. And while Republicans are working every day to empower the American people, the Democratic agenda is all about themselves. That's all they think about is themselves. Okay? It's a disgrace what's going on. It's a disgrace. I said to somebody that's been here a long time, you people would know better than anybody, some of you that have been here, ""Has it ever been this bad?"" And they said, ""Well,"" they said, ""Yes, it was."" They said, ""During the Clinton impeachment hearings it was worse."" They said, ""There was another time in the 1880s when it was worse."" A couple of people were shot, you know."
00:59:12 - 00:59:33 (21 sec),"Even new people wouldn't do that. And the Civil War, who could forget? I would say the Civil War was bad. And by the way, speaking of the Civil War, where is Doug Collins? You're another warrior? Where's Doug Collins? Where the hell is Doug? Man, he's up there fighting. Doug. Thank you, Doug. Warrior. Where's Mark Meadows, another warrior?"
00:59:33 - 01:00:00 (27 sec),"Where's Mark Meadows? What the hell is -- Oh, don't tell me he's got one of those bad seats. Are you with Jim Jordan? That's the Freedom Caucus. What the hell happened to you guys? They're great guys. They are. Everybody in this room as far as I'm concerned. Nearly 100 House Democrats are promoting the biggest Socialist takeover in U.S. history."
01:00:00 - 01:00:24 (24 sec),"That's what's happening. The Green New Deal, it'll cost $100 trillion. Nobody has any idea what that means, $100 trillion. I have wealthy friends they say, ""Write out $1 trillion."" They have no idea. They just keep going. They say, ""Nobody has any idea."" The Democrats are also proposing a massive government takeover of healthcare that would ban private health insurance."
01:00:24 - 01:00:54 (30 sec),"And that's a tremendous thing for us to run on. Because people want -- we have 180 million people that want that. The Democratic plan would destroy American healthcare, bankrupt our country, oh, forget it, not even close, and take away your private doctors. Now, I'm only afraid that we're going to be too hard on the Green New Deal and they're not going to do it, because I want them to do it. We don't want to have them knock it out before we get to run against it so let's take it easy."
01:00:54 - 01:01:31 (37 sec),"I'm -- I'm actually saying, ""It's a wonderful thing."" The Green New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29-years -- old. A young bartender, wonderful young woman, the Green New Deal. You know, but it's crazy. You know, the first time I heard I said, ""That's the craziest thing."" You have senators that are professionals that you guys know that have been there for a long time, white hair, everything perfect, and they're standing behind her and they're shaking, they're petrified of her, ""We support the Green New Deal."" How about the woman from Hawaii, the senator from Hawaii -- highly nice woman, right?"
01:01:31 - 01:01:58 (27 sec),"Oh, I'm glad I didn't say it. I'm going to get great points from my wife for not saying that -- but she was so angry to men, right? Remember, she was screaming at men? And -- and then they asked her about the Green New Deal. ""I love it."" They said, ""Yeah, but you don't allow airplanes anymore so you can't get to Hawaii."" ""Oh, we have to work on something."" So somebody jokingly said, ""We'll build a train to Hawaii,"" and she actually thought it was a decent idea."
01:01:58 - 01:02:23 (24 sec),"So now she supports it because she thinks they're going to build a train to Hawaii. But they really believe this stuff. And you know, it's like, it's the craziest thing. They believe it. And we will have to do something but don't do it too early, please. Don't kill it because we want to be able to run against it. If they beat me with the Green New Deal I deserve to lose."
01:02:23 - 01:02:50 (27 sec),"It's true. And just to finish up, and -- and this is so important, and -- and you know, I'm doing this almost as let's get together and talk because we have to win. We have to take back the House. We have to. There's no reason to have lost it. And what really lost it and really helped us lose it was healthcare because we didn't have an alternative."
01:02:50 - 01:03:07 (17 sec),"We just said, ""Well, let's not talk -- "" Somebody came out the other day, they asked a Republican, two weeks ago, health care and he turned off the mic, ""Well, I'm going home now."" You can't do that. You got to confront it. We'll be the party of healthcare. Republicans should not run away from healthcare."
01:03:07 - 01:03:29 (22 sec),"You can't do it. You're going to get clobbered. And I have an idea and I think it's great. I spoke with Kevin about it. I spoke with a lot of your really top people, smart people, and they love it. I spoke with the Senate about it. I spoke to Mitch. Mitch didn't like it, but then he found out when we're taking the vote, right after the election."
01:03:29 - 01:03:56 (28 sec),"He said, ""Oh, I like that idea."" And I understood why he didn't like it at the beginning because it's been a tough subject. It's been a subject stay away. If we stay away from that subject we're going to lose. We're going to lose. We can't stay away. It's too important. It's too important, because the Democrats -- You know what?"
01:03:56 - 01:04:21 (25 sec),"We have the border. We have, if you look at it, we have the immigration but we have a lot -- we have the crime. We have the police. We have the military. We have so much. They have health care right now. We have to take that away from them. We take that away -- we take that away we will not even come close."
01:04:21 - 01:04:43 (22 sec),"So here's the concept, we have to protect and cannot run away from a thing called preexisting conditions. We can't do it. You're going to get clobbered. A friend of mine is running in a certain state. I'm not going to embarrass him. He's got a 20-point lead. He's running for governor. 20-point lead, it's over."
01:04:43 - 01:05:16 (33 sec),"About a month later I say, ""Hey,"" the election hadn't take place -- taken place, I said, ""How is it going out there? How's he doing?"" ""Sir, he's 20 points down."" ""Wait a minute. He was 20 points up. What are you talking about?"" ""No, sir, right now he's 20 points down. He's getting killed."" I said, ""Why?"" ""Because he wanted to terminate preexisting conditions."" Well, that was a poll."
01:05:16 - 01:05:59 (43 sec),"This is a guy, he ended up getting clobbered. He had an easy race. He was already buying the carpet for the mansion. Not our mansion, a different mansion. I guess that didn't work out too well. And I'll never forget, five governors sitting in front of me, I was making a speech, very conservative governors, and I said, because I hadn't really taken a position and, but I -- I think we have to go with the preexisting, and I'm making a speech, ""And we will support, and the Republicans cherish preexisting conditions."" And these five Southern guys down there, they're looking me, ""What the hell was that all about?"
01:05:59 - 01:06:19 (21 sec),"What?"" And I told him, I said, ""We have to support it. We should support it. We're doing the right thing. And if you don't support it, you have no chance of winning. I mean, I just want to be blunt, you have no chance of winning."" The Democrat plan will be devastating to the people with preexisting conditions."
01:06:19 - 01:07:22 (63 sec),"We have great talking points. The Republican Party will be the champion of preexisting conditions. You have to do it. Some of you like it, some of you don't, but you're going to have to like. Not only for politics, it's the right thing. We want to be the party of great health care. I am, right now, working with people, and here's the key to all of it, I'm right now working with people in this room, knowledgeable leaders in Congress and with experts in the administration, I have a couple of people, one in particular who is a total health care genius, this person knows more about healthcare and loves the subject, loves it, to come up with a great health care plan that is far less costly to the people, not to the government, to the people."
01:07:22 - 01:07:45 (23 sec),"Far less costly than Obamacare with the deductibles that are far lower. The deductibles are so high that nobody gets to use it unless you're in serious condition so serious that, frankly, the last thing on your mind is health care. I will be asking that this be my first vote immediately after the election."
01:07:45 - 01:08:06 (21 sec),"We are going to regain the House because of health care and other things, the border, the military, the police. They're for open borders and crime. We're for great borders and merit-based immigration, merit-based, so they can help our country and help our companies that are all moving into our country and need people to work."
01:08:06 - 01:08:31 (25 sec),"We're going to keep the Senate and we're going to keep the presidency and we're going to bring back the House. So essentially, what I'm saying is we're going to come up with a health care plan. We're not going to vote on it until after the election. We'll all promise it's going to be our first vote because we blew it the last time."
01:08:31 - 01:08:55 (24 sec),"Man, I was fed a bill of goods. I want to tell you, some of you, I'm still a little bit angry, but not all of you. Wasn't even your fault. But we should have done it when we had the position. But we're going to get it back and it's got to be a better plan. So we're going to give a great health care plan."
01:08:55 - 01:09:23 (28 sec),"And we're going to go and campaign on that plan with the understanding that if we win it's going to be much less expensive than Obamacare and much more usable in terms of deductibles. And what's going to happen is we're going to promise the people that if you vote for us and if they vote for you, all of you running, that we're going to vote for this."
01:09:23 - 01:09:49 (26 sec),"It's going to happen but we have to get back the House. You know what? You're going to win back the House. I think it's going to be one of the strongest things you have because people don't like Obamacare. We forgot about it. We had a very, very unfortunate vote by somebody. We were close. We were so close."
01:09:49 - 01:10:04 (15 sec),"One vote away. One vote away. But it didn't work. But this is going to be something, I think, that has even more potential. It's going to be a better plan. I already know what they're doing with it. And we're going to -- we're going to use it. We're going to campaign on that plan. And it's so much better than Obamacare."
01:10:04 - 01:10:23 (20 sec),"Now, here's your alternative, turn off whatever they talk about health care. ""I don't want to talk about it. Oh, it's a bad -- "" because, you know, I know it's a tough subject. But we have a great advantage here. And we vote right after the election. It's going to get a lot of people elected and you're going to be doing the right thing."
01:10:23 - 01:10:41 (18 sec),"Additionally, we'll be knocking the Democrats Socialistic, single payer health care plan with all of the disasters floors, including all of those great Americans that are going to lose their plan. Remember, ""You can have your doctor. You could have your plan."" I mean, so many lies, so many lies. So you're going to be campaigning against very negative things."
01:10:41 - 01:11:05 (24 sec),"You're going to win your elections because of health care. And a lot of people were upset with me because I announced this like a week ago, and I didn't want to waste my time by calling people. I didn't want to call the leaders, other than Kevin. I'd be afraid to call Kevin. But I didn't call people. They said, ""What?"
01:11:05 - 01:11:33 (28 sec),"What? I don't know anything about it."" I blame myself a little bit. But now they love it. They really like it. You're going to get elected because of it and you're going to be doing the right thing. It's a great incentive for the voters to vote for you. So instead of when they ask you a health care question and say, ""I'd -- I'd rather not answer that question."" ""But what about preexisting -- "" ""Ah, ah, Alice, take me home, Alice."
01:11:33 - 01:11:59 (27 sec),"They're asking me about preexisting -- Alice, please take me home."" And then you get clobbered. You got a plan that's a much better plan. And it's going to be your first vote when you get back to Washington. The radical Democrats are also aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth, right."
01:11:59 - 01:12:20 (21 sec),"Whoever heard of this stuff? I had it in the debate. I never use the term ripped. It was my term. And people that had been working on this on our side for years said it was an incredible moment. I didn't know about -- I didn't use that term. I never heard of that term. I thought of it during the debate, because Hillary Clinton was so staunch on abortion and rights of abortion."
01:12:20 - 01:12:41 (21 sec),"And I said, ""According to Hillary, in the ninth month you can rip -- "" that's where it came up. Does anybody remember that debate? They say that was like a big moment. You can rip the baby out of the womb and kill the baby. But now it's gotten worse. Because this maniac, the governor from Virginia, he comes up and says, ""Now the baby is born."
01:12:41 - 01:13:11 (30 sec),"And you wrap the baby gently and then you talk to the mother and dependent on what the mother says you execute the baby."" Can you imagine, whoever heard of it? I never even heard of this one. I've heard of ninth month, which is horrible. I've heard of fifth month and fourth month, but this is the baby is now born and the mother will make a decision as to whether or not that baby will be, essentially, executed."
01:13:11 - 01:13:30 (19 sec),"And he said that. He said that. And he said some other things that were unrelated to that which were bad. And believe it or not, which were covered even more so than that, which I couldn't believe that it was. His other thing, you know what that was, was covered more importantly in the media than that. And what can be more important than that?"
01:13:30 - 01:13:48 (18 sec),"That's why I've called on Congress to pass legislation banning the late-term abortion of children who can feel the pain in their mother's womb. And, you know, it's always been a very close issue. It's been for many, many years. It's been a 50/50 issue. I don't know if you saw, it was so horrible and so extreme what the Democrats in New York, you saw what was happening, they're all applauding."
01:13:48 - 01:14:11 (22 sec),"It was so horrible, so horrible, that you gained 11 points in the poll. This is the first time it's no longer -- it was a 49-51 issue for many, many -- for decades. It never really changed. It would go from 51-49 back and forth. You just picked up 11 points because of how extreme that was. It was so terrible."
01:14:11 - 01:14:27 (16 sec),"Democrats are the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, hoaxes, delusions. Whenever House Democrats are ready to abandon their extremism the Republicans here tonight are ready to work with them to deliver a much better future for all of our citizens. We're willing to work together."
01:14:27 - 01:14:54 (27 sec),"I told Nancy Pelosi the other day, I was with her, it was a nice conversation. Unfortunately, every time we have a great conversation she then goes out and does a news conference and she says I'm a terrible human being. I don't figure that but I guess that's called politics. Every day we're restoring America's strength at home and we are restoring our nation's standing all over this world."
01:14:54 - 01:15:16 (22 sec),"Two years ago ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. I was told that it would take at least two years from one month ago to get the Caliphate at 100 percent. You saw that. My generals, that I got rid of, told me it would take two years to get two percent. I went to Iraq."
01:15:16 - 01:15:57 (41 sec),"I stayed in the White House for almost four months. The only time I left was to go to Iraq. I'll tell you, if you have to get cabin fever getting cabin fever in the White House is still a good place. But I went to Iraq and I met the generals and one general said, ""Sir, we can do it in one week."" I said, ""Wait a minute, they said two years."" They said, ""That's because we're hitting them at a much different level."" And we did it and we now have 100 percent of the ISIS -- it's been completely obliterated."
01:15:57 - 01:16:18 (21 sec),"And that doesn't mean you don't have cells and these crazy people, I got to say it, because you saw it, you can never say, ""We won,"" because if you say, ""We won,"" and then somebody blows up a store, some crazy maniac. But we just beat the hell out of them. And we're trying to now beat them at the Internet because there's nobody better at the Internet than them."
01:16:18 - 01:16:42 (24 sec),"I don't know if you saw recently I put some social media that they're losers, that they're dead. That if you join them you will be killed just like they're killed. We got to beat them at their own game, folks. It's not a very nice game. And they don't surrender. When we had them, I was telling Kevin McCarthy, when we had them four or five days ago, they were cornered."
01:16:42 - 01:17:08 (26 sec),"They don't know what it is to be cornered because they always had free reign. They're not -- they don't have free reign with me. And we flew over with brand new F-18s, Super Hornets, and they're going 2,000 miles an hour over and over for two days. And I said, ""Do these people ever like wave the flag? Do they ever surrender?"" And the General Raisin Cane, his name?"
01:17:08 - 01:17:45 (37 sec),"What's your first name? You know this. ""Sir my first name is Raisin."" This guy's out of central casting, I'm telling you. There's nobody in Hollywood that could look like this guy because he's much tougher. That I can tell you. I said, ""What's your name?"" ""Raisin."" ""What's your last name?"" ""Cane."" I said, ""You mean your name is Raisin Cane?"" ""Yes, sir."" That's the guy that told me. I said, ""So, my people tell me two years."
01:17:45 - 01:18:07 (21 sec),"What do you think?"" ""One week, sir."" I said, ""General, come here. Give me a kiss."" I felt like Joe Biden. But I meant it. See, I meant it, big difference. I meant it. So we knocked them out. And we now have knocked them out. And we have -- but I always say you have some crazy people around, nevertheless."
01:18:07 - 01:18:24 (18 sec),"Together, we're also fully rebuilding the American Armed Forces -- and you're doing that, what you're doing is incredible. Because without that the other things might not matter. It's a rough time of this world. I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal -- and Iran is a different country."
01:18:24 - 01:18:56 (32 sec),"When I first came here, Iran was going to take over the Middle East and there was no stopping him. And I took out of that deal. I terminated that deal and they have gone to hell. That's a different country. They have riots. Their economy is collapsed. It was a horrible, stupid deal. We gave them $150 billion and they used it to fight us. We gave them $1.8 billion in cash, airplane loads of cash."
01:18:56 - 01:19:16 (20 sec),"And I recognized the capital of Israel and we opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem for a $1 billion under budget. $1 billion under budget. We were going to spend $1 billion to build it. I got it done for $400,000. Think of that. So I saved $1 billion. I took a building that we already owned on land that we already owned."
01:19:16 - 01:19:43 (27 sec),"Somebody said, ""What's the difference between that piece of land and the piece that we were going to spend a fortune to buy?"" I said, ""The difference is it's much better. It's a better location. It's a much bigger site."" Other than that, they were very similar. And to support Israel's security just last week, and this has been going on for 58 years, I recognized fully Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights."
01:19:43 - 01:20:08 (25 sec),"58 years, they've been talking. They've had committees, they've had meetings, they've had 32 different meetings and it's talk and they never do it. So we did it. And I'll tell you what, I don't know about the United States, I think we're doing well, but I can run for the prime minister of Israel. That's what they tell me. I think I've been 90 -- I think I'm at 98 percent in Israel."
01:20:08 - 01:20:36 (28 sec),"You'd better be careful, I'll leave here and I'll go run in Israel. The United States has also taking decisive action against the brutal Socialist dictatorship in Venezuela. That's a horrible situation. And America, once again, stands with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, in their righteous struggle for freedom and we're helping them out."
01:20:36 - 01:20:56 (20 sec),"So we're gathered here tonight at a very pivotal moment in our nation's history. That's true. This is a very important moment. You know, we have forces going against this country from within that can destroy this country. If we lose this election -- You know, when I go out to make a speech I meet people."
01:20:56 - 01:21:18 (22 sec),"I don't get to see too many people, but I meet people backstage going on. And they'd say to me, ""Thank you, sir, for saving our country."" They're talking to all of us, by the way. ""Thank you, sir."" A man came up to me a week ago. We were in Michigan. We had a tremendous crowd in Michigan. Right? Is that right?"
01:21:18 - 01:21:45 (27 sec),"That's a good group. Great crowd. And this guy looked like he never cried in his life. He looked like football player, a big strong guy and he was pouring down tears as I'm getting ready to speak. I'm walking by and he was there and he said, ""Sir, thank you for saving our country."" And I used to be surprised because I've been hearing this for a year and a half, I used to be surprised."
01:21:45 - 01:22:16 (31 sec),"You know, it's a big statement and they're oftentimes crying. And they're people that don't cry. These are not criers. These are people that are real stalwarts, not crying. Nothing wrong with crying, but they often are crying. And I've heard it so much. We have an election coming up that if something bad should happen with this election we could lose the country, we really could, because these people are stone cold crazy."
01:22:16 - 01:22:41 (25 sec),"What they want to do to our country would be overwhelming. It would be horrible. So we have no choice, we have to win. We really have to win. Now, it could be the start moving in a different direction, but I don't think so. It looks like they're only moving one way. The majority of American people support our common sense agenda."
01:22:41 - 01:23:05 (24 sec),"And Americans do not want to risk their prosperity or our prosperity. They don't want to risk their children's future. They don't want to risk their wealth. They don't want to risk their 401ks, where they're up 50, 60, 70, 80 percent. I talk about it all the time. They feel like financial geniuses. They've never been there before."
01:23:05 - 01:23:31 (26 sec),"And we're going to explain to them that your 401k will disappear. You're not going to have anything. We have a lot of great things going. So the Democrat program of radical Socialism and open borders, if we are good, and if we are smart, and if we do our job, it cannot work. It's not going to work. Because our people are doing too well."
01:23:31 - 01:23:51 (21 sec),"The choice has never been clearer, the Republican Party is the party for all Americans. We really are. We have changed this party so dramatically, folks. I -- I say all of us, not just me. I've been -- I've been important. You've been just as important. We're now the party of the American worker. Did you ever hear?"
01:23:51 - 01:24:21 (30 sec),"When I started doing this we were like the party of the rich person and we will losing and there were not enough rich people. We're now the party of the American family and we're the party of the American dream. It's true, you are. In South Carolina, when I was going against a lot of different people, there were 12 people left, and I'll never forget somebody came down and said, ""You have no idea what you've done."
01:24:21 - 01:24:41 (20 sec),"Thousands and tens of thousands of people are joining the Republican Party. This has never happened."" They've never seen it before. And this happened in New Hampshire. It happened to all over. It happens in Florida. It's happening now in Florida. I mean, I don't like to talk about leads to early, but we have an incredible lead in the state of Florida."
01:24:41 - 01:25:12 (31 sec),"We have an incredible lead in the state of Ohio. We have a great lead in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in South Carolina. I mean, we have leads. Now, you always have to be very careful because you have, on occasion, seen leads disappear, but we're not going to let that happen. Because we have the far better ideas, the far better platform, and I know many of the people in this room, we have the far better and more talented people."
01:25:12 - 01:25:48 (36 sec),"You are the people I'm talking about. And we believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe in religious liberty. The right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms."
01:25:48 - 01:26:14 (26 sec),"We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we believe in the words of our national motto, ""In God We Trust"". We're not going to lose that. We're not going to lose that. People want to play with that. They're not playing with that one."
01:26:14 - 01:26:50 (36 sec),"They want to play with that, you know that. We're not playing with that one. ""In God We Trust"". We fight on behalf of hardworking citizens who pay their taxes, follow our laws, raise their children, protect our communities, and made this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth. And we're doing better now than we've done in decades, and decades, and decades."
01:26:50 - 01:27:23 (33 sec),"This land is our home. These American patriots have always been loyal to our country and we will forever be loyal to them, forever. Every day for the next 19 months we will keep on fighting, we will keep on working, and we will keep on winning, winning, winning for the American people -- and for yourselves, and for yourselves, and your families."
01:27:23 - 01:28:11 (48 sec),"With your help, on November 3rd 2020 Republicans are going to win the House, we are going to win the Senate, and we are going to, again, win the White House. Thank you. And together with the love, prayers, and devotion of everyone in this really warm and incredible room, and millions of patriots across our land, we are going to Make America Great Again."
01:28:11 - 01:28:31 (20 sec),"We are going to make America greater than it's ever been before. And we are going to do it not just for you, not just for your friends, we are going to do it for all Americans. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you, everybody."
00:00:00 - 00:00:29 (29 sec),"We love that song, but let's get going. Right? I want to thank you all, and I want to thank, especially, Melania -- she works so hard -- and those moving words, even though it is from your wife, so she's maybe a little bit prejudiced in that way. But I will say that she is a hard worker and has a profound commitment to building a drug-free future for America's children."
00:00:29 - 00:00:59 (30 sec),"We're going to do it too. We're going to do it. Made a lot of progress. Today, I'm honored to join the thousands of leaders -- and that's what you are: leaders -- from across the country for the 2019 Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. Very important. Everyone here today is united by the same vital goal: to liberate our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction and to end the opioid crisis once and for all."
00:00:59 - 00:01:34 (35 sec),"It's happening. It's happening. That's happening. I want to recognize the founder of Operation UNITE for his unwavering community service, for his incredible commitment, and to address this critical issue: Congressman Hal Rogers. A friend of mine for a long time. And I want to thank you very much, Hal, wherever you may be. Thank you."
00:01:34 - 00:02:00 (26 sec),"Thank you, Hal. Good job. Very dedicated guy. We're also grateful to Operation UNITEâs President and CEO, Nancy Hale. Thank you, Nancy. And thanks also to an outstanding public servant, a man who works day and night. No matter when I need him, he's there. I'll call him at the strangest hours."
00:02:00 - 00:02:24 (24 sec),"He's always there working. Secretary Alex Azar. It's really great, Alex, what you're doing. Thank you. And CDC Administrator, Dr. Robert Redfield, who is helping us to eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2030. And we're there; we're going to be able to do that. People are shocked. Please, stand up, Doctor. So important."
00:02:24 - 00:02:48 (24 sec),"I said that recently in a speech: We will eradicate AIDS by 2030. We've made such incredible progress. And they didnât know what I was talking about. They couldnât believe it. They came up to me after the speech, Doctor. They said, ""Do you mean that?"" That's right -- we're going to have it eradicated by 2030. Thank you very much, Doctor."
00:02:48 - 00:03:10 (22 sec),"Very important. Also with us is the Lieutenant Governor of this great state, a friend of mine and a man who -- he's worked so hard with Brian. The combination of Jeff Duncan and Brian has been pretty much unbeatable. They're doing a fabulous job. Jeff, thank you very much. Jeff, where are you? Jeff? Jeff, thank you."
00:03:10 - 00:03:36 (27 sec),"Stand up, Jeff. Great job. Really great job. And, Mrs. Duncan, thank you very much. And the Georgia Attorney General, Chris Carr. Chris, thank you. Tough guy. And he's in there fighting for us. I know that. As well as members of Congress: Rick Allen, Drew Ferguson, Barry Loudermilk, and Jody Hice."
00:03:36 - 00:04:02 (26 sec),"We have them all. We have them all. Thatâs a pretty unbeatable group. Weâve been doing okay together, havenât we? Huh? Weâve been doing good. To all of the people in this room who serve every day on the frontiers and frontlines of this crisis -- and a crisis it is -- you have earned the gratitude of our entire nation."
00:04:02 - 00:04:33 (31 sec),"You may not even know it, but our nation loves you and they love what youâre doing. Thank you very much. You are the first responders who bring patients back to life. You are the law enforcement officers who bring drug traffickers to justice. You are the doctors, nurses, and counselors who give struggling citizens the hope and solace and strength to build a brighter and brighter future."
00:04:33 - 00:05:05 (32 sec),"And you are the families and faith communities who help thousands of Americans overcome addiction for a new life of freedom. My administration is deploying every resource at our disposal to empower you, to support you, and to fight right by your side. And thatâs what weâre doing. We will not solve this epidemic overnight, but we will stop -- thereâs just nothing going to stop us, no matter how you cut it. I know some of the people in this room."
00:05:05 - 00:05:30 (25 sec),"Nothing stops you. Nothing stops you, I can tell you. We will never stop until our job is done, and then maybe weâll have to find something new. And I hope thatâs going to be soon. But we will succeed. We have results that are unbelievable; numbers that I heard, two weeks ago, that I was shocked to hear."
00:05:30 - 00:05:56 (26 sec),"Weâre making tremendous progress. Each year, more than 70,000 precious American lives are lost to the opioid and drug crisis. And, in my opinion, the number is much higher than that. To protect all Americans, my administration declared the opioid epidemic a nationwide public health emergency. A big step."
00:05:56 - 00:06:36 (40 sec),"Since then, we have secured a record $6 billion in new funding to combat the opioid crisis, and thatâs the most ever. And weâre going for even bigger numbers this year. Last year, we provided $90 million to prevent youth substance abuse, and I signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act -- the largest-ever legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in our nationâs history."
00:06:36 - 00:07:13 (37 sec),"Itâs the largest ever. Following the recommendation of my Surgeon General and many others, last year the distribution of the overdose-reversing drug, naloxone, increased by over one million units. Pretty amazing stuff. To expand access to treatment, recovery, and other crucial activities and services, all throughout our nation we have given opioid response grants to states, totaling a record $2 billion."
00:07:13 - 00:07:35 (22 sec),"We are now allowing states to use Medicaid funds to pay for residential treatment facilities, and theyâre being built all over the country. In my first year in office, the number of patients receiving medication-assisted treatment at community health centers increased by 64 percent. No other President did that."
00:07:35 - 00:08:31 (56 sec),"No other President. We have no choice. We have no choice. We passed the CRIB Act to expand treatment for mothers and their babies who are born physically dependent on opioids. For our nationâs veterans, we are improving pain management, with over 43,000 fewer veterans on opioids since January 2017. Think of that -- 43,000. Twenty-three thousand [Forty-three thousand]. And, by the way, for the veterans, 45 years theyâve been trying to get it. As you know, just recently, I signed Veterans Choice, where a veteran can go, and if the wait is going to be days or weeks or months -- which it used to be -- they go out and see a private doctor."
00:08:31 - 00:09:02 (31 sec),"Take immediate care. We pay for it. We take care of it. And it's been an incredible -- it's new and it's been incredible, the difference it's made. And just months ago, I signed bipartisan criminal justice reform into law. Among other critical changes, the FIRST Step Act provides addiction treatment to Americans in prison."
00:09:02 - 00:09:43 (41 sec),"And I'm pleased to report that, in just four months, more than 16,000 inmates are participating in new drug treatment. And criminal justice reform -- I have to say, people are getting out of prison. And since our founding, they were having an impossible time getting a job. But because our economy is doing so well, perhaps the best it's ever been in our history -- best unemployment numbers in history, best everything."
00:09:43 - 00:10:07 (24 sec),"Because of this -- because of this, prisoners getting out are signing in; they're getting jobs. And I can tell you that those employers -- because I speak to a lot of them -- are thrilled. They had no idea. I'm so proud of that. So, the great economy has made it much easier. They get out, and then they have to prove themselves."
00:10:07 - 00:10:26 (19 sec),"They never got a chance to prove themselves. Now they prove themselves, and they are doing a spectacular job. Not all of them, but there's nothing ""all"" about any of us. But they are doing a spectacular job. So I want to thank all of you. And I want to thank -- Congressman, I want to thank you for helping me with that, because you were very instrumental."
00:10:26 - 00:10:52 (26 sec),"Thank you very much. Thank you. The Department of Labor is expanding federal efforts to help recovering Americans find a great job in our soaring economy. As a result of our historic economic boom also, we are lifting up all Americans from all walks of life, including those who have endured the pain of addiction."
00:10:52 - 00:11:09 (17 sec),"They're getting a second and third and, in some cases, a fourth chance. And they're making it. They're making it. And they really have something to live for. Some of them say, ""We love getting up in the morning. We love going to work. We love our job."" And if they don't like the job because of what's happened, it's a miracle."
00:11:09 - 00:11:35 (26 sec),"All over the world, they're talking about what's happened with our economy. If they don't like their job, they have choice also, like the vets. They have choice. It's choice of going out and finding a different job that they like better. Big impact. Last year, a record 73 percent of the new jobs went to people who were out of the workforce and are now coming back to work for the first time in many years."
00:11:35 - 00:12:03 (28 sec),"And these newly employed citizens are joining 5.5 million more workers who have found jobs since the election, driving our national unemployment rate to its lowest level in 51 years. And, as you know, and you've heard me say it, African American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country."
00:12:03 - 00:12:30 (26 sec),Asian American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country. Hispanic American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country. People that graduate without a high school diploma -- it's a big group -- lowest in the history of our country. Women -- sorry -- lowest in 61 years. [Laughter] But we'll soon have the record.
00:12:30 - 00:12:55 (25 sec),"We will soon have the record. We're going to have that record, too. We're all Americans. We are all one family. And we know that we are strongest when no one is left behind. My administration is committed to ensuring that every citizen can live with dignity and purpose and proudly pursue the American Dream."
00:12:55 - 00:13:43 (48 sec),"Critical to this effort is my administrationâs strong support for faith-based initiatives. America is a nation that believes in the power of prayer and the strength of fellowship, and we believe in the grace of God. And we're proud of it. Here with us today is Dr. Monty Burks. Nineteen years ago, Monty turned his life around when two women of prayer from his hometown church helped him to get on a path to recovery."
00:13:43 - 00:14:08 (25 sec),"Now Monty works for Tennesseeâs -- what a great state -- Department of Mental Health and is Director of their Faith-Based Recovery Initiative. Monty, please, come up and tell us a little bit about your work."
00:14:08 - 00:14:33 (25 sec),"In awe, honor, and humbled. The opposite of addiction is relationship. That simple equation is what helped me find my freedom. Criminal justice intervention led me to treatment, which led me to recover, which put me on this podium. I've been blessed to serve under Commissioner Williams -- and Commissioner Varney past before."
00:14:33 - 00:14:48 (15 sec),"They took a chance on a broken and bruised person who had been touched by the system, but they knew that I had a purpose, and my purpose was to use the pain that I'd went through to help other people not have to go through the same thing that I'd went through. You see, recovery is real. We do recover. We do recover."
00:14:48 - 00:15:17 (29 sec),"To me, the paradigm shifts with the faith community. Our governor, Bill Lee, supports the faith-based community being the catalyst to change, to control the narrative, to explain how people and recovery can come back and be fruitful and change the paradigm themselves, in their own communities."
00:15:17 - 00:15:38 (21 sec),"Employers trust the faith community. We go back to work not just for a job but for a career, so we can go back and lead as peers so those who were behind us crying in the wilderness will have a second chance to stand before a podium like this and tell you that, yes, recovery is real. We do recover."
00:15:38 - 00:16:06 (27 sec),"Secretary Azar, I want to thank you for your work with HHS and the Office of Faith-Based with Shannon Royce and Heidi. And they spread the word and the message about faith-based recovery and treatment across the state. Today, this is my pulpit, and I have to say this: Someone in a program hears me right now and says, ""I can, because you did."
00:16:06 - 00:16:20 (14 sec),"I can, because he did."" That's right. Yes, you can. Look in the mirror. There is your miracle. I want to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me this space to stand beside you. I want to thank God for you and the First Lady and your support of the recovery community. Thank you."
00:16:20 - 00:17:11 (51 sec),"Wow, that's great, Monty. And he had this beautiful speech written down in his iPhone -- this is the new way of doing it -- [Laughter] -- and he never looked at it once. [Laughter] That's a pretty good job. Thank you very much, Monty. Appreciate it. Fantastic. My administration has also embarked on an unprecedented effort to shut down online criminal networks, crack down on illegal international shipments, and stop the deadly flow of drugs into our country."
00:17:11 - 00:17:37 (26 sec),"In the past two years, Customs and Border Protection seizures of meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl at the southern border are up 45 percent and going up much higher. We are seizing it all over. You probably saw the numbers today. We are detaining, capturing -- call it anything you want -- more people than ever before."
00:17:37 - 00:18:07 (30 sec),"Some of those people are not people we want in our country. And I will say Border Patrol has been incredible. There's never been a march up that border like there is today, up throughout Mexico. Mexico is starting to detain and bring back to their country, where they came from. But a lot of it is drugs, and drugs are being gotten by us. We are stopping the drug flow as much as we can."
00:18:07 - 00:18:27 (20 sec),"Soon, we're going to have a wall that's going to be a very powerful wall. It's under construction. The media doesnât like talking about it. The media doesnât like talking about it. It's one of many things we're doing. But when that wall is finished, we intend to have almost 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year."
00:18:27 - 00:18:52 (25 sec),"We're probably ahead of schedule a little bit. That'll have a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country. And we have many other things, including the finest equipment that that you can buy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the best drug detection equipment you can have. And I always say this: Because as good as that equipment is -- and itâs genius -- the greatest equipment in the world is a dog."
00:18:52 - 00:19:13 (22 sec),"Dogs -- a certain type of German Shepherd in particular. Dogs do a better job than 400 million dollars' worth of equipment. Can you believe that? Only the dog lover would understand that, right? No, it's true. I said to the Border Patrol the other day -- they were giving me a little bit of a rundown on the equipment."
00:19:13 - 00:19:32 (18 sec),"And, you know, itâs hundreds -- weâre close to 500 million dollars' worth of equipment at the ports of entry. I said, âHow does this compare to those great dogs I saw?â They say, âSir, honestly, the dogs are better.â [Laughter] I said, âYou got to be kidding.â Itâs incredible, and they showed me, and itâs actually incredible."
00:19:32 - 00:19:57 (25 sec),"But we also have a lot of dogs, and theyâre great dogs, and we cherish them. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which enters our country through our southern border. Weâre doing everything to empower ourselves so that we can keep this poison out of our communities and away from our children."
00:19:57 - 00:20:17 (20 sec),"You're going to see some very, very big differences in the coming months. Weâre capturing people that you wouldnât believe. And if you remember, when I announced that famous run, when I came down -- Iâm sure nobody saw this. When I came down the escalator with Melania and her white dress -- I donât think anybody saw that -- [Laughter] -- but I made a very strong statement about the border and I was criticized."
00:20:17 - 00:21:04 (47 sec),"They said, âOh, itâs not that bad.â Well, let me tell you, that statement was peanuts compared to reality. Peanuts. It was small-time, compared to reality. But we are confronting reality and confronting the grave security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border. And thatâs why Iâve declared a national emergency, which is exactly what it is. And weâve secured historic funding to strengthen border security, including the equipment, including the wall, including more Border Patrol agents -- including many other things that you donât even have to know about and some you donât want to know about."
00:21:04 - 00:21:37 (33 sec),"Congress must also act to fix, however, our horrible, obsolete, weak, pathetic immigration laws. We could solve the entire problem -- I say â45 minutes,â but it could go a lot quicker than that; letâs bring it down to 15 minutes -- if the Democrats would agree to do certain basic, commonsense things with respect to our laws."
00:21:37 - 00:21:55 (18 sec),"And I do think that thereâs pressure being put on them, and I think that some of them really do want to do the right thing. Iâve spoken to some recently, and you might be surprised at whatâs going to happen. But they see whatâs going on at the border. Itâs very easy to see. And theyâre seeing the drugs and theyâre seeing the human trafficking."
00:21:55 - 00:22:16 (20 sec),"The human trafficking has -- itâs like never before in our history. And this is a world problem, and itâs happening all over the world, but for us, itâs through the southern border. Today, weâre grateful to be joined by Virginia State Police Senior Special Agent Tom Murphy, who has been chasing down drug traffickers for decades."
00:22:16 - 00:22:50 (34 sec),"In recent years, he has seen a surge of cheap heroin being trafficked from Mexico, which is now being laced with ultra-lethal fentanyl. Tragically, a year and a half ago, Special Agent Murphyâs own son died from an overdose of this kind of deadly drug. And it is deadly. Special Agent Murphy, Americaâs heart breaks for you and for all of the families that have suffered so needlessly."
00:22:50 - 00:23:10 (21 sec),"No other family should have to experience the pain and the sorrow that youâve endured. Would you please come up to say a few words? Please, Special Agent. Thank you."
00:23:10 - 00:23:35 (24 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President and First Lady, for this time and opportunity to speak. Both professionally and personally, Hal has touched my life and my familyâs life. I worked for the State Police of Virginia for 31 years, assigned to a narcotics division drug enforcement section for 23 of those 31 years. I sat in your seat four years ago, at this same conference."
00:23:35 - 00:24:08 (34 sec),"While I was here four years ago, my son Jason was battling drug addiction. His story is one thatâs all too common today. He grew up with ADD, depression, and was medicated at a young age. Prior to 18 years old, he started self-medicating with marijuana. He knew at 18 years old he had to move out of the house because Dad is Dad, and Dad is a police officer, and you canât do that at home."
00:24:08 - 00:24:34 (26 sec),"Well, on his 18th birthday -- on the day he turned 18 -- he moved out of our home. He would later tell me it's the worst decision he's ever made in his life. When he did so, about a year or two later, he had a work-related injury where he severed four fingers from his hand. He was introduced to opioids, which was my greatest fear."
00:24:34 - 00:25:12 (38 sec),"I would see him around town, and my wife -- you could his physical decline. He'd been arrested a couple of times for possession and distribution to continue his habit. Twelve days before Christmas -- December 13th, 2017, 12 days before Christmas, he passed away of a heroin and fentanyl overdose."
00:25:12 - 00:25:52 (40 sec),"People talk about stigma associated with opioids, heroin, drugs. There is a stigma, and the stigma needs to stop. If you want to think about stigma, think about a family that's been though it professionally and personally. And my family has. And that's only one family of 70,000 in 2017 who lost a loved one because of opioids and heroin."
00:25:52 - 00:26:21 (29 sec),"The stigma needs to stop. You need to share your story. I wear two bracelets every day since my son's death. On my right wrist is a purple bracelet to honor those who have fallen from drug overdose. It has his name on it and date and birth and date of death. On my left wrist, I have two: Thin Blue Line and I've got another one that simply states, ""Every overdose is someone's child. Don't judge. Educate."""
00:26:21 - 00:27:01 (39 sec),"So that's why we're here and that's why you're here. You took the first initiative, maybe, if you're here for the first time, to collaborate, to brainstorm, to strategize, to figure out this problem collectively. But the message I want to convey today is: Don't judge. There are 70,000 different stories that happened in 2017. You heard my son's. His name was Matthew Jason Murphy. Thank you."
00:27:01 - 00:28:13 (73 sec),"Thank you. You know, I think I can say with surety that your son, your boy, is looking down right now at you and he's very proud of his father. Very, very proud. Thank you. We are making great progress to stop fentanyl from coming into our communities. As a result of my negotiations with President Xi of China -- doing a very big trade deal -- they've announced that next week they will implement new measures to prevent Chinese fentanyl -- which is most of it; almost all fentanyl comes from China -- from being shipped to the United States."
00:28:13 - 00:28:42 (29 sec),"And furthermore -- and I appreciate this, from President Xi -- they've agreed that they're going to make it a major crime. It's not a crime now. It's down as an industrial drug. And they're going to make it a crime, and they're going to charge people with the highest level of crime. And, in China, unlike in our country, the highest level of crime is very, very high."
00:28:42 - 00:29:18 (36 sec),"It's the ultimate. You pay the ultimate price. So I appreciate that very much. Since I signed the STOP Act into law, our amazing Customs and Border Protection officers have stopped over six times more packages from reaching American doorsteps. It's a big deal. Right here, in Georgia, Customs and Border Protection officers at the seaport in Savannah recently discovered an estimated 19 million dollars' worth of cocaine in a shipment of Colombian pineapples."
00:29:18 - 00:29:47 (29 sec),"Today, we're proud to be joined by two officers who helped find those deadly drugs: James Long and Derrick Nobles. And thank you both for your courageous work. Where are you, folks? Where are you? Come on. Come on up here. Come up. Please."
00:29:47 - 00:30:04 (17 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you all for having us here, first of all. And again, thank you for all your support. It's been a -- it's been a long road, and we're glad to have the President behind us. I'm glad to have you all behind us on the law enforcement side and the community itself, because you all are our biggest help with finding this."
00:30:04 - 00:30:10 (6 sec),"It's like finding a needle in the haystack, on most days. But again, thank you all every day for your support. Thank you."
00:30:10 - 00:30:39 (29 sec),"Thank you. Thank you both very much. Great job. So many incredible people that I've met doing exactly what you're doing. To all of the Customs and Border Protection officers, DEA agents, and state and local law enforcement that are here today: We love you, we support you, and we are with you all the way."
00:30:39 - 00:31:07 (28 sec),"All the way. You know, we had billions of dollars of military equipment, which the previous administration, for their own reason, was not willing to give up to law enforcement. And I decided that we will. This was beautiful, great, strong, powerful equipment, safety equipment. You know exactly what I'm talking about."
00:31:07 - 00:31:26 (19 sec),"And we gave billions and billions of dollars throughout the United States to law enforcement. And it's had a tremendous impact because -- I don't know if it's for that reason. Probably not. It's probably because of the great men and women involved. But the numbers are way down. Crime -- way down. So, thank you all very much."
00:31:26 - 00:32:03 (38 sec),"Appreciate it. My administration is also taking aggressive action to reduce the over-supply of highly addictive prescription drugs. The Department of Justice has prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in cases involving opioids. And earlier this week, the United States filed criminal charges against the sixth- largest drug wholesaler for illicit distribution of opioids -- because we are holding big pharma accountable."
00:32:03 - 00:32:30 (26 sec),They should be accountable. And they didn't give to my campaign. I don't want their money. [Laughter] They gave to a lot of other campaigns; that's the problem. But we are holding them -- I couldn't care less. They've got to do what's right. Doing a lot of things. We're also working very strong on drug pricing.
00:32:30 - 00:33:07 (37 sec),"It's coming way down. For the first time -- for the first time in 54 years, drug prices went down this year. They went down a little below even. That's a big thing. First time in 54 years. And I give great credit to you, Alex, for that. You and your whole group of wonderful people. Alex was a very, very successful executive at one of the biggest of the companies, and he understood the system better than anybody."
00:33:07 - 00:33:31 (24 sec),And we're lucky to have him. He has done an incredible job. Thank you very much. Many drug companies are giving European countries a better deal than they give their own country. And that has to stop. We've already informed them that's stopping. We are making sure that our great seniors on Medicare will share in the discounts given to other countries.
00:33:31 - 00:34:02 (31 sec),"And you know what that means. The sophisticates out there that do this for a living, you know exactly -- that's a big deal. Sounds like big deal, but it really is a big deal. At long last, we're stopping the drug companies and foreign countries from rigging the system -- I know all about the rigging the system because I had the system rigged on me. [Laughter and applause] I think you know what I'm talking about."
00:34:02 - 00:34:25 (23 sec),"Unfortunately, that will be your sound bite tonight, but that's okay. [Laughter] System was rigged. But rigging the system against our great seniors. And to help doctors and scientists develop non-addictive painkillers, we have nearly doubled funding for opioid and pain research. Thank you very much, Doctor."
00:34:25 - 00:34:58 (33 sec),"Come on. Stand. He gives away more money than any human being on Earth. Thank you. Great. Such an important -- if we can find that answer, that's going to be a big -- that's going to solve most of the problem, I suspect. How close are we? [Laughter] He's saying, ""Okay."" [Laughter] You'll get it. You'll get it. One year ago, we pledged to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third."
00:34:58 - 00:35:31 (33 sec),"Already during my time in office, we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent. That's a pretty amazing number. Pretty amazing. And I'm glad to report today that drug overdose deaths are down in the various states that we polled and checked -- the ones hardest hit by the opioid crisis: New Hampshire, West Virginia, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Ohio."
00:35:31 - 00:35:56 (25 sec),"And they're very steeply down in three of those cases. An amazing achievement. When I campaigned in those states, that was the biggest thing. And nobody would think it. Unless you're really involved, nobody would think it. Over the last two years, our National Prescription Drug Take Back Days have collected nearly 3.7 million pounds of prescription drugs."
00:35:56 - 00:36:31 (34 sec),"Thatâs seven times the weight of Air Force One -- a very nice plane that's parked about 10 minutes away. [Laughter] A very, very big, big, heavy plane. Think of that: seven times. And the next drug take back day is this Saturday. It's great. And finally, we know one of the most important steps to ending the opioid crisis is to prevent young people from ever using drugs in the first place."
00:36:31 - 00:37:07 (36 sec),"Our massive public awareness campaign about the horrific suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58 percent of young Americans. Where's Kellyanne? Kellyanne, stand up. Kellyanne Conway. She's done a great job. I keep saying, ""Kellyanne, where are those ads?"" Because, you know, if you do it properly -- and we've had some great ones, great ads -- young people looking at these ads, they won't start."
00:37:07 - 00:37:51 (44 sec),"I think, in many ways, you don't see the result for four or five years, but in many ways, that's one of the most important things we can be doing. So we're doing that and we're spending a lot of money on that. I think it's very important. When they look out, and somebody comes to them and wants to sell them drugs and they start thinking about what they just saw on television, or wherever they may have seen it, it's going to be a little harder for them to make that sale, and that's okay with me. It's the way we want it. And I'm very encouraged that in my first year in office, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 100,000 fewer teens started abusing prescription painkillers."
00:37:51 - 00:38:15 (25 sec),"One hundred thousand. Here with us today is Alex Elswick and his mom -- wonderful mom -- Shelley. As a young adult, Alex overcame addiction and is now -- with his mom, they founded an organization to help families in crisis. Alex and Shelley, would you come up and share your story? Thank you. Please."
00:38:15 - 00:38:24 (9 sec),"Well, good afternoon."
00:38:24 - 00:38:26 (2 sec),Go Cats!
00:38:26 - 00:38:57 (31 sec),"[Laughs] Go Cats. My name is Alex Elswick, and I'm a person in long-term recovery. And many of you already knew that, but perhaps what you didn't know is that this is my mom. And we're a family in long-term recovery. And I could tell you all about how my addiction was ""Groundhog Day"" in hell -- lived over and over and over again."
00:38:57 - 00:39:26 (29 sec),"But we've heard enough of death and destruction for a few years now. I'd rather tell you how grateful I am to be here and how grateful I am that I get to work every day alongside my mom and my friend, Amanda Fallin-Bennett, doing the work with Voices of Hope to help people in recovery stay in recovery. And I'd like to use this time to say a big ""thank you"" to every single individual in this room who works tirelessly every day to improve the lives of people like me. Because Monty said it best: We do recover and we recover together. So thank you all for being voices of hope."
00:39:26 - 00:40:20 (53 sec),"And thank you both. As Alex and Shelley remind us, our greatest resource in the fight against drugs is the heart and the might and the soul of the American people. We will prevail because of the courage, commitment, and compassion of heroes like all of you in this room today. You're incredible people. You are Americaâs true source of strength."
00:40:20 - 00:40:49 (30 sec),"So let us resolve that, together, we will support, cherish and care for our fellow citizens through every step and every challenge on their road to recovery. We will reach out to anyone who is hurting or lost or struggling, because every American deserves to know the glory of hope, the joy of belonging, and the blessings of healing."
00:40:49 - 00:41:22 (33 sec),"We will stand proudly behind our devoted doctors and nurses and medical professionals who work so hard, and they do so much. We will honor and celebrate the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you. We love our law enforcement. I don't know if you know it, but over the last two and half years, law enforcement has become hot."
00:41:22 - 00:41:48 (26 sec),"They were having a little problem, right? But they're hot. People are loving their law enforcement more than ever before because we respect you at the highest level. We respect you. And the job you do is incredible -- and dangerous -- but it's incredible. We will strive to give every child a loving home, and every home a thriving future."
00:41:48 - 00:42:18 (30 sec),"We will renew the bonds of family and faith that link us together as citizens, as patriots, and as Americans. We will not let up. We will not give in. And we will never, ever give up on saving American lives. We will end this terrible menace. We will smash the grip of addiction. We will make our cities safe, our communities strong, and our future brighter than ever before."
00:42:18 - 00:42:40 (22 sec),"As one united nation, we will work, we will pray, and we will fight for the day when every family across our land can live in a drug-free America. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:53 (54 sec),"Thank you very much, El Paso. Thank you very much. Thank you. I am very, very thrilled to be here in the great State of Texas -- right on the banks of the legendary Rio Grande, where by the -- well, I don't know, you heard, right? Today we started a big, beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande. Right smack on the Rio Grande."
00:00:53 - 00:01:53 (60 sec),"I love this state and I love the people of this state. We've had a great romance together. You know, that. It's been a great romance and we're only getting stronger together. That's what's happening. Wow, look at all the press back. You believe that? [Audience Boos] This is like the Academy Awards used to be, used to be. They've gone down a long way since they started hitting us a little bit, right?"
00:01:53 - 00:02:38 (45 sec),"They've gone down. That was a long -- that was a long fall, but there they are. Last week I was honored to stand in the House Chamber to deliver the State of the Union -- and I asked both parties to come together to choose greatness for America. Since taking office two years ago our economy is now the hottest economy anywhere on Earth."
00:02:38 - 00:03:16 (39 sec),"Our military, which desperately needed funding, we went $700 billion and $716 billion, is More powerful than ever before. That was not a good situation. It was tired and depleted. Our great warriors were not taken care of. Now they're taken care of again the way they should be. And America is winning again."
00:03:16 - 00:04:11 (54 sec),"Isn't that nice? We're fighting for all Americans, from all backgrounds of every age, race, religion, birthplace, color, creed. We're fighting for ourselves. We're fighting for all Americans. And what is it, America first? Remember, it's America first. [Audience chants USA] Our agenda is not a partisan agenda, although some people say it is. [Audience member calls out We love you] Every once in a while it does become that way."
00:04:11 - 00:04:53 (42 sec),"Right? It's a mainstream, common sense agenda of the American people. It's where we want to be and where we want to go. And despite the fact that the media refuses to acknowledge what we've done and how well we're doing it -- [Audience Boos] -- a new poll just came out as I was coming on and it shows -- I don't know how you can do this, I don't think I've had a good story in years. [Audience laughs]"
00:04:53 - 00:05:17 (24 sec),"I don't get good -- I used to get great press until I decided to run for office. And we have done together, an incredible job. And a new poll just came out today Rasmussen, one of the most respected polls, one of the polls that got the election right, so I have to remember that, you know what the number is, 52 percent, with no good news."
00:05:17 - 00:05:50 (33 sec),"Explain that. Explain that. Explain that. How do you get that when you don't get good press? I guess 93 percent of the stories are negative. No matter what we do, they figure out a way to make it bad. [Audience Boos] Like, I'll give you a quick example. When I came in, North Korea was -- it looks like it was going to war."
00:05:50 - 00:06:22 (31 sec),"You know that. It was going to happen, bad things. Now you have no missile launches. You have no rocket testing. You have no nuclear testing. I have a good relationship, maybe even a great relationship. We have tremendous sanctions on North Korea. But we have our hostages back. We have -- remains are coming back."
00:06:22 - 00:06:47 (25 sec),"Remains. And our presidents have been dealing with North Korea for many, many decades, many, many decades. And on a nuclear way over the last 20, 30 years and all I hear is, ""Can't you move faster?"" You know what? I left Singapore 15 months ago, they've been negotiating for 85 years or something. So now their complaint is, ""What's taking him so long?"" I heard one of our great geniuses from a previous administration telling me how to negotiate with North Korea when they got taken advantage of like nobody I've ever seen before. [Audience Boos]"
00:06:47 - 00:06:56 (9 sec),"So some day, with all of us, this is all of us -- and those hats are beautiful, by the way -- Someday -- True. Someday they're going to appreciate us all. And I'm going to Vietnam, to Hanoi, in the near future, 27th and 28th of February, to have another summit and hope we -- hopefully we do as well with the second summit as we did with the first."
00:06:56 - 00:07:07 (10 sec),"I hope so. Now, we're delighted and I'm delighted to be joined this evening by the Texas leaders. You have great leaders, great people, great help to me -- that are at the forefront of this incredible American Revolution. You know, there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. We have to understand."
00:07:07 - 00:07:28 (22 sec),"There's never been. If you would say, as an example, that tonight, 69,000 people signed up to be here. Now, the arena holes 8,000, and thank you fire department, they got in about 10, thank you fire department, appreciate it. But if you want to really see something go outside, tens of thousands of people are watching screens outside."
00:07:28 - 00:07:48 (19 sec),"Tens of thousands. And we were all challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz. [Audience Boos] And then they said, ""You know what? Hey, you're supposed to win in order to run. By the way, we, I, we, I'm one and one, I'm one for one. Think of it. We had one election, we won, now we're going to be 2 for 0 and everything's going to be perfect."
00:07:48 - 00:08:05 (18 sec),"But a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name, he has -- he challenged us. So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too good. In fact, what I do, what I would do is I would say, ""that may be the end of his presidential bid,"" but he did challenge us. So I want to introduce some great people."
00:08:05 - 00:08:35 (29 sec),"Your Governor, Greg Abbott. Greg. Where is he? Where's Greg? Thank you Greg. And a great governor and a great friend of mine. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Thanks Dan. Thank you Dan. Look at him in the corner, so shy. Thank you Dan. Great job, Dan. Attorney General Ken Paxton. Thanks, Ken. And Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller."
00:08:35 - 00:09:05 (30 sec),"Thank you, Sid. Thank you, everybody. Thanks, Ken. Great job you do. And we're especially grateful to your wonderful Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Great Senators. [Audience Chants USA] And we have a lot of your Congress men and women. We have a lot of them. Are you already? And they're terrific. And they've been with us all the way."
00:09:05 - 00:09:35 (30 sec),"Pete Olson. Pete. Thanks, Pete. Thank you, Pete. Michael Burgess. Thanks Michael. John Carter. Brian Babin. And Randy Weber. Thank you very much. We are in the midst of an economic miracle. That's what's happened. You look all over the world and you study and you see what's going on. You can look at China."
00:09:35 - 00:10:22 (47 sec),"We have a team right now in China, they want to make a deal very badly. Those tariffs are costing them a lot of money and they're going into our Treasury, remember that, we're filling up with billions of dollars. And did you see the, you know, I haven't been here very long, the trade deficit really went down very big this last month, and people are saying, ""Whoa."" I told you so. That's what I do. That's what I do. And we don't want China to have a hard time."
00:10:22 - 00:10:49 (27 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. I -- I can only tell you this, we're going to make great deals on trade. We're going to make great deals on military. When we defend another nation that's rich they have to help us out. Do we agree? They have to help us out. And they're doing it. They're doing it. You saw South Korea, they were paying us $500 million a year."
00:10:49 - 00:12:15 (86 sec),"I say you got to do more. You got to give more. Anyway. Now they're up to almost $900 million, that was like a do phone calls. I said -- I said, ""Why didn't they do this before?"" They said, ""Nobody ever asked. Nobody asked."" You pick up almost $500 million a year, nobody asked. We're defending rich countries, they've got to help us out, folks."
00:12:15 - 00:12:31 (16 sec),"They've got help us out, sorry. And you know what? They're going like us more and maybe more importantly, they going to respect us. Since the election, we have created 5.3 million new jobs, including more than a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing was dead? They said manufacturing was dead, the previous administration."
00:12:31 - 00:12:51 (20 sec),"You'll never have it. You need the magic wand. That's what they said. We obviously, we found the magic wand. And by the way, those numbers is small compared to what's happening, compared to all of the companies that are moving in. The unemployment -- [Audience Boos, chants USA] Thank you very much. Thank you."
00:12:51 - 00:13:18 (27 sec),"The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have reached the lowest level in the history of our country. [Audience chants Trump] Okay, thank you. Thank you. Are you all right? Everything okay? Please. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And women have filled almost 60 percent of the new jobs created last year, which were a record number."
00:13:18 - 00:13:41 (23 sec),"We passed massive tax cuts for working families and we canceled a record number of job killing regulations. That's why your oil and gas is coming back. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate. And to give critically ill patients access to life saving treatments, we did something that they haven't been able to do for a long time, we passed Right To Try."
00:13:41 - 00:14:07 (26 sec),"Right To Try. That's an incredible thing, Right To Try. You know, we have the greatest doctors and research in the world, and if somebody was terminally ill they traveled to Asia, they traveled to Europe, they'd travel all over the world, if they had the money. If they didn't have the money, they'd just go home, there was nothing they could do. And I said, ""Wait a minute."
00:14:07 - 00:14:30 (22 sec),"We have drugs in the pipeline that are showing tremendous progress. If somebody is terminally ill let's let them have access to our drugs. Let's let them have access."" And it's much tougher than you would think. But we got it and people, you will not understand, nobody understands, the lifesaving effects, it's incredible what's going on. They are getting better."
00:14:30 - 00:15:35 (65 sec),"People are getting better that were thinking they were going to die. It's right to try, I love it. I always wondered why we didn't do it before? Now, the people in Texas won't care much about this, but the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on Earth. I didn't think you'd care about that."
00:15:35 - 00:15:57 (22 sec),"I didn't think Texas would care about that. And listen to this, and Texas oil production is now at the highest level it's ever been. And only for the great oil professionals in the room, we're getting those pipelines approved so fast you'll be able to practically double up on oil production, oil and gas."
00:15:57 - 00:17:06 (69 sec),"They're getting approved at record levels and record time, that means more money, more security, and more independence for our country -- it's very simple. Another one they said could never get passed, they've been trying to do it for 40 years, we passed VA Choice, Veterans Choice. So that now, rather than waiting online for five days, for nine days, for three weeks -- [Audience Boos, Chants USA] Where do these people come from?"
00:17:06 - 00:17:34 (28 sec),"Where do they come from? They go back home to Mommy. They get punished when they get home. [Audience chants Build that wall] Now, you really mean finish that Wall, because we've built a lot it, steady and slowly. But before we get to the Wall, so VA Accountability and VA Choice. Accountability, we couldn't fire anybody from the Veterans Administration."
00:17:34 - 00:17:56 (22 sec),"We couldn't fire anybody. They could treat our veterans badly. We had to take it. Now, you get rid of them. And VA Choice, they'd wait online for days and weeks, they couldn't see a doctor. Now, they go out, they have a choice. They get a private doctor. They have things taken care of and we pay their bill."
00:17:56 - 00:18:29 (33 sec),"They've been trying to get those two things fixed for many, many decades, many years and we got it fixed. We also passed the Farm bill for wonderful farmers, ranchers, and growers. Just got it. We just got it passed and that was it easy but we got it passed. We had to do it. Our farmers are great. So we just get that done, farmers, ranchers, growers."
00:18:29 - 00:18:50 (21 sec),"And we passed historic legislation to combat the Opioid Crisis. [Audience chants Trump] Thank you. [Audience Boos, Audience chants hey, hey, hey, goodbye, as an audience member is removed from the coliseum] Thank you. Is there any place that's more fun to be that a Trump rally, is there any place? You know, they all said, ""Mr. President, we loved the tone of your State of the Union speech."" Some people said it was a great speech."
00:18:50 - 00:19:29 (39 sec),"Some people said, ""Really a great speech."" I said, ""But if I ever did that in El Paso, Texas, it wouldn't work here too well,"" do you agree? Nice and calm. No, that's not what you're looking for. This is more fun. This is more fun. And we just signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. Nobody thought that was going to be happening."
00:19:29 - 00:19:48 (19 sec),"In my address last week, I asked lawmakers in both parties to cross the aisle and join together for the common good for all Americans. Democrats have to stop being so angry. They're angry. And they've got to start being partners to keep this -- really, look, is just an incredible miracle that's going on? We want to keep it going."
00:19:48 - 00:20:10 (22 sec),"Keep it going, and it will keep going. It will keep going. There's so much to celebrate in our country, the economy, the military, so many things we've done scientifically. The world is trying to copy what we've done, they're not going to be able to do it. Not anymore. They were catching up fast, now they're going in the wrong direction."
00:20:10 - 00:22:05 (115 sec),"Wrong direction. Unfortunately, many of the Democrats in Congress responded to my call for bipartisan cooperation by instead choosing really -- hey, look, did you ever see anything -- radical resistance, it's the radical left. But maybe it'll change. [Audience Boos] Maybe it'll change. It all has to do with 2020 and the election."
00:22:05 - 00:22:19 (15 sec),"But I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of ""Let's hop a train to California."" [Audience Boos] Of you're not allowed to own cows anymore. You know, a lot of problems. A lot of problems. But nobody's ever had this. And by the way with us, we handle it. No president should ever have to go through what we've gone through in the first two years."
00:22:19 - 00:22:35 (15 sec),"It's a hoax. It's a disgrace, and it should never be allowed to happen again. A hoax. Just recently, as an example, Senator Richard Burr, from the great State of North Carolina. He's chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and they've been investigating this Russia hoax for two years. [Audience Boos] Think of it. They've interviewed over 200 people."
00:22:35 - 00:22:55 (20 sec),"They've studied hundreds of thousands of documents and pages and Richard just announced that they found no collusion between Donald Trump and Russia collusion. The fact is, that the real collusion was between Hillary and the Democrats and the other side with Russia, that's where the collusion is. That's where the collusion is. [Audience chants Lock her up] That's starting to make a lot more sense."
00:22:55 - 00:24:44 (109 sec),"But that's where the collusion is, with the Democrats, and with Russia, and with others. And by the way, there's also collusion between the Democrats and the fake news right here. [Audience Boos] And they know it better than anybody. Too many Democrats are focused on tearing down their opposition instead of building up our country."
00:24:44 - 00:25:27 (43 sec),"They're trying to impose some of the most extreme measures and policies ever put forward by our Congress. And by the way, I don't think anybody in this room wants to pay 70, 80, 90 and 95 percent tax. Does anybody want to pay a 90 percent tax? [Audience Boos] You know, you look at what we've done with jobs, what we've done with the economy, how low your taxes are, the lowest they've been almost from the beginning, who the hell wants to change what we're doing now?"
00:25:27 - 00:25:52 (25 sec),"We are a hot, hot country. Last week they introduced a massive government takeover that would destroy our incredible economic gains. They introduced the so-called Green New Deal. [Audience Boos] It sounds like a high school term paper that got a low mark. [Audience laughs] It would shut down American energy, which I don't think the people in Texas are going to be happy with that. [Audience Boos]"
00:25:52 - 00:26:14 (22 sec),"It would shut down a little thing called air travel. [Audience Boos] How do you take a train to Europe? [Audience laughs] You know, this -- this crazy senator from Hawaii, they said, ""Do you like it?"" ""Yes, I like it very much."" Oh, really, how are we getting to Hawaii on a train? [Audience laughs] She didn't think about that one but she's thinking about it. She'll figure it out."
00:26:14 - 00:26:42 (27 sec),"They want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home, and put millions of Americans out of work, spend $100 trillion, which by the way, there's no such thing as $100 trillion, you have to spend $100 trillion -- And remember this, no other country except us is going to do it. That's a little problem, too."
00:26:42 - 00:27:17 (35 sec),"While the world's real polluters, like China, would get many of our companies and factories, they'd just move into China, move into other parts of the world. That's the way the system works. It's not going to happen folks. Don't worry, it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. $100 trillion. Let's spend $100 trillion."
00:27:17 - 00:27:46 (29 sec),"Let's rip down every building in New York City and rebuild it environmentally slightly better. To pave the way for socialism, Democrats are calling for massive tax hikes and the complete elimination of private health care. Many of us have private health care. That means you can stand on line for five days as you wait for a doctor that is not nearly as talented as your doctor."
00:27:46 - 00:28:10 (24 sec),"Remember? ""You can keep your doctor."" Remember that? 28 times, ""You can keep it."" That didn't happen. It turned out to be alive. Hey, where are the fact checkers? You know, some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact checkers. 28 times, ""You can keep your doctor."" That didn't turn out to be what he said."
00:28:10 - 00:29:31 (81 sec),"They're coming for your money and they're coming for your freedom and it'll never happen and it won't even come close, folks. Democrats are also pushing extreme late-term abortion. [Audience Boos] Allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. What's that all about?"
00:29:31 - 00:29:48 (18 sec),"So in Virginia, the governor, he's got a little publicity lately. [Audience laughs] I like it. It keeps us out of the papers. I like it. I'd like to find a few more guys like this one. He almost moon walked. His wife stopped him, ""Darling, that would be inappropriate."" I want to see somebody trying to imitate Michael Jackson in the moonwalk."
00:29:48 - 00:30:18 (30 sec),"This would not have been a good scene. His wife saved him, darling, this would be inappropriate."" I think she was right. But the governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable. And then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby."
00:30:18 - 00:30:53 (34 sec),"Execute the baby. [Audience Boos] Incredible. Millions of innocent, beautiful babies are counting on us to protect them and we will. That is why last week I go I called on Congress, with your great congressman over there -- thank you, fellas -- to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion."
00:30:53 - 00:31:13 (20 sec),"And that certainly is extreme. Many people never even heard of it. I mean, have you ever even hear of anything like this? [Audience calls out No] Democrats must also address the double standard on full display in Virginia. By the way, that state's going to go Republican pretty soon, I'm pretty sure -- because the Democrat Party has never been more outside of the mainstream."
00:31:13 - 00:31:36 (23 sec),"They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders, and crime. [Audience Boos] This weekend, some Democrats even proposed a measure that would force the release of thousands of criminal illegal aliens -- [Audience Boos] -- including dangerous felons convicted of rape, sex trafficking, violent assault, and even murder, into our country."
00:31:36 - 00:32:06 (31 sec),"Can you believe this? [Audience Boos] Their proposal would put a hard cap on the number of illegal aliens that are brave ICE officers, we love our ICE officers -- can detain and thus remove, forcing thousands of criminals to be set free into United States communities. I don't think so. Okay. I don't think so. And I want to thank our ICE offices."
00:32:06 - 00:32:51 (45 sec),"What they put up is incredible and that includes Border Patrol and that includes law enforcement. Let's face it. Law enforcement, we love them. They keep us safe. In the last two years alone, ICE officers have made 200, listen to these numbers, 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 40,000, 40,000 larcenies 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 12,000 vehicle thefts, 11,000 robberies, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 murders. [Audience Boos]"
00:32:51 - 00:33:10 (19 sec),"-- murders, murders, killings, murders. [Audience chants Build that wall] We will. We will. If we cut detention space, we are cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country. Slashing ICE tension is the first step of many for the far left, I call them the radical left We will never abolish ICE."
00:33:10 - 00:33:44 (34 sec),"They want to abolish ICE. We're never going to abolish ICE. So let me say very clearly to those pushing this ridiculous and radical agenda, I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country. And I will never abolish or in any way mistreat our great heroes from ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement, never."
00:33:44 - 00:34:12 (28 sec),"We will always stand with those brave men and women. We will always be with them. We're going to take care of them just like they take care of us, remember that. Now, I have to tell you, as I was walking up to the stage they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we're building the Wall anyway."
00:34:12 - 00:35:10 (58 sec),"They say that progress has been made, interesting. Just now. Just now. I said, ""Wait a minute. I got to take care of my people from Texas. I got to go. I don't even want to hear about it."" I don't want to hear it. So I don't know what they mean ""progress is being made significant"". Now, what did happen is the Democrats were being hit really hard on the concept of releasing criminals into our society, that has not been playing well."
00:35:10 - 00:35:35 (25 sec),"So maybe progress is being made, maybe not. But I had a choice, I could have stayed out there and listened or I could have come out to the people of El Paso in Texas. I chose you. I chose you. So -- so we probably have some good news. But who knows? Who knows? We'll -- we're -- we're setting the stage folks."
00:35:35 - 00:36:22 (47 sec),"You know what it's called, right? It's called with setting the stage. We're setting the table. We're doing whatever we have to do the walls being built, it'll continue. It's going at a rapid pace. The Rio Grande, it's happening, go check it out. We proudly welcome those who come lawfully, and support our values in the United States, and that want to strengthen our society and help us with all of the companies moving into the United States, moving back, they left us now they're moving back, many of them, in some cases, maybe all of them, but they all want to come back because the United States is where the action is, very simple. [Audience chants USA]"
00:36:22 - 00:37:00 (38 sec),"It's where the action is. And it is -- we're most proud of the fact, you look at the car companies, they're moving back. They're going into Michigan. They're going into Pennsylvania. They're going back to Ohio. So many companies are coming back. And by the way, that's why I want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit."
00:37:00 - 00:37:29 (29 sec),"Through merit, so they can help us build our country. Make America Great Again, pretty soon we're going to be saying, Keep America Great, Keep America Great. Pretty soon. Pretty soon, congressman, Keep America Great. We'll have to switch over. Tell me, tell me, the campaign's sort of started because you have these people that nobody ever heard of, they're all running for office."
00:37:29 - 00:38:19 (50 sec),"I said, ""Who is that?"" ""Well, that person was a mayor of a city that was defeated."" Well, how about Beto, Beto was defeated to, right? [Audience Boos] But he suffered a great defeat. Watch what the news does tomorrow, though, they won't mention the disparity. They won't mention the disparity tomorrow. They'll say, ""Beto O'Rourke,"" That's his last name, right, O'Rourke?"
00:38:19 - 00:38:58 (38 sec),"Beta O'Rourke had a wonderful rally of about 15 people. [Audience laughs] No, when they get honest, when the media starts becoming honest, and maybe they will, because we've done something that's never been done before, we have suffered a totally dishonest media and we've won and it's driving them crazy."
00:38:58 - 00:39:36 (38 sec),"It's driving them crazy. It's driving them crazy but look at them, they still come. I've never said anything like it. But illegal immigration hurts all Americans, including millions of legal immigrants, by driving down wages, draining public resources, and claiming countless innocent lives. You see what's going on, folks."
00:39:36 - 00:40:37 (61 sec),"You know what's going on. They give you all of these phony stats they say, ""Oh, it's the same. It's the same."" It's not the same. It's a bad situation going on and we've stopped it. We are taking out thousands and thousands of people from MS-13, we're bringing them to hell out of our country, thousands. But if we had proper border security, including a very powerful wall, we wouldn't have to work so hard and it would be a lot safer and a lot better."
00:40:37 - 00:41:13 (36 sec),"My Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration, while modernizing our legal immigration system, which has been in terrible shape for many, many decades to prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves for them actually and contribute to our economy, people that come in on merit, merit, merit -- instead of random lotteries and chain migration."
00:41:13 - 00:41:39 (26 sec),"Chain migration, that's another beauty. [Audience Boos] We want a merit based system for entry, this will improve living conditions for all Americans living here today, both immigrant and U.S. born, everybody's going to be happy. And we need the people to take care of these companies that are moving. Our unemployment rate, real unemployment, 3.6, 3.7 -- and going down, had a little blip because of a thing called the shutdown."
00:41:39 - 00:42:47 (68 sec),"But remember, it went up to 4.0. I said, ""Boy, that's -- "" Do you know how low 4.0 is? Do you know anybody else, any other president that would have said, ""Please give me 4.0, please?"" [Audience laughs] We had a little blip, it went up from 3.7 to 4.0, just quickly. But you know what? If we didn't do that shutdown we would not have been able to show this country these politicians, the world, what the hell is happening with the border."
00:42:47 - 00:43:19 (33 sec),"That was a very important thing we did. And the fact is, illegal immigration is a heartbreaking human tragedy. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the very long and dangerous journey north up to our country. Sex traffickers, these are the worst human beings on Earth, exploit our porous border to sell young girls and women into modern day slavery."
00:43:19 - 00:44:21 (62 sec),"You wouldn't even know that, nobody knows that. And by the way, do you think they come in through the ports of entry? [Audience calls out No] I listen to the Democrats, let me nice, just say the Democrats, I won't be specific, and they say, ""Oh, everything comes through the port."" They don't do that. They drive out where there's no barrier, no wall, they make a left."
00:44:21 - 00:44:56 (34 sec),"Congratulations, you're in the United States. That's all. If you have three women tied up in the backseat of a car, you're not going through, folks, a port of entry where they do look in the backseat, at least, right? Drugs pouring through the border kills tens of thousands of innocent Americans a year, including heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, and so many others."
00:44:56 - 00:45:31 (35 sec),"They come through the Southern border. We have a drug problem over the last 6, 7, 10 years like we have never had before. We can have such a big cut in the numbers, in the percentages, if we get the Wall built -- if we have a strong Wall with other things, but we need the Wall and it has to be built and we want to build it fast."
00:45:31 - 00:46:02 (30 sec),"The number of illegal immigrants crossing our borders is so large that we've know where to hold them. We have to build -- they want buildings, they want jails. They want, these people, how about the word caravan? [Audience Boos] Caravan, I think that was one of mine, but it looked like a caravan. Where you have thousands and thousands of people coming from Guatemala, from Honduras, and El Salvador, and they march up through Mexico."
00:46:02 - 00:46:26 (24 sec),"And by the way, if we didn't have walls in those areas, in some cases that we put up, in many cases where we reinforced, in many cases where our great military helped us with barbed wire -- you would have people pouring in. They don't pour in. The problem is our laws are so bad that there's no way we can quickly remove them."
00:46:26 - 00:46:59 (33 sec),"Other countries say, ""Get out of here."" We have to bring them through a court system. We sign their names, they touch our land, we sign them up, we explained to them, ""Please come back in six years for court,"" and only the dumbest people show back up. Nobody ever shows up. Nobody comes back in, like 2 percent."
00:46:59 - 00:47:33 (34 sec),"They go in to our country. The good news is we have great law enforcement and many of these people, we know where they are, and we're going to get them the hell out. But we have to change our laws. So right now we have a backlog. You won't even believe this. Other countries don't do this. Somebody walks into our country, we bring them to court, we have now a legal -- we need Perry Mason -- [Audience laughs] -- we have a legal case."
00:47:33 - 00:48:07 (34 sec),"Nobody else does that. Other countries say, ""Get out. You can't come in. You're not a citizen of whatever country."" We bring them in. So listen to this, right now we have almost 900,000 cases, 900,000. How many judges are going to take care of -- we're going to have to hire tens of thousands of judges to do that, 900,000 cases."
00:48:07 - 00:48:58 (50 sec),"How stupid is this? This was a system put in place by really dumb people or people that did not have the best interests of our country at heart. And there's no place better to talk about border security, whether they like it or not, because I've been hearing a lot of things,"" Oh, the Wall didn't make that much of a difference."" You know where it made a big difference?"
00:48:58 - 00:49:34 (36 sec),"Right here in El Paso. And I've been watching where they've been trying to say, ""Oh, the Wall didn't make that much -- "" Well you take a look at what they did with their past crimes and how they made them from very serious to a much lesser, you take a look at what the real system is. I spoke to people that have been here a long time they said, ""When that wall went up, it's a whole different ball game."" Is that a correct statement?"
00:49:34 - 00:50:22 (48 sec),"A whole different ball game. I'll give you another example. And I don't care whether a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat, they're full of crap when they say it has it made a big difference. I heard the same thing from the fake news. They said, ""Oh, crime actually stayed the same."" It didn't say the same, it went way down and look at what they did to their past crimes and look at how they recorded those past crimes, it went way, way down."
00:50:22 - 00:50:42 (20 sec),"These people, you know, you'd think did want to get to the bottom of a problem and solve a problem, not try and pull the wool over everybody's eyes. So for those few people that are out there on television saying, ""Oh, it didn't make too much of a difference,"" it made a -- people from El Paso, am I right?"
00:50:42 - 00:51:31 (48 sec),"It's fake news. It's fake. I'm telling you, just fake news. And you know what? You wouldn't even have to know you can say that automatically without even knowing it. It's obvious, it's common sense. Just a few thousand feet, as an example, from where we stand right now on the other side of the border, it's one of the most dangerous cities in the world, Juarez, Mexico."
00:51:31 - 00:52:17 (46 sec),"Well, the people at Juarez agree. Yet, thanks to a powerful border wall and El Paso, Texas it's one of America's safest cities now. Now, listen to the this, so you're talking a few feet away, right, a few feet, got a wall, a few feet away. Last year Juarez had 1,200 murders, El Paso, right next door, a few feet away, had 23 murders."
00:52:17 - 00:52:51 (34 sec),"That's not good either. But 23 compared to 1,200. Walls work, actually there's nothing like them for what we're talking about. We want to stop drugs. We want to stop traffickers. We want to stop criminals from coming in, walls save lives. Walls save tremendous numbers of lives. The biggest proponents of open borders are rich liberals and wealthy donors."
00:52:51 - 00:53:14 (23 sec),"These are hypocrites who oppose security for you while living their entire lives -- I do it too, to be honest with you, I'm guilty. I'm guilty. I also live behind walls, okay. They live behind walls and gates in their guards all over the place. Me too, because I want to be safe and I want to make America safe, if you don't mind. [Audience chants USA]"
00:53:14 - 00:53:43 (29 sec),"So security should not belong only to the rich and to the powerful, safety is the birthright of every American, which is why we must finish the Wall. It's happening. Because walls are not immoral, as it was said, human trafficking is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Drug peddling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes]"
00:53:43 - 00:54:22 (40 sec),"Child smuggling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Sanctuary Cities that get Americans killed, they're immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Open borders are dangerous and immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] My administration has put forward a compromise that really is a compromise, and I hate even compromise on things like this, but it's showing common sense, it's compassionate, and it's going to solve our problem and the cost is a fraction."
00:54:22 - 00:55:27 (64 sec),"When you look at the drugs that are pouring across from Mexico, if it stopped a small percentage, and it won't, it'll stop a large percentage, it would pay for itself in a matter of weeks. That's the kind of numbers you're talking about, a matter of weeks. And by the way, I -- I hate to say this, because we have a very good relationship, but Mexico had the highest number of killings that they've ever had, almost 40,000 people were murdered in Mexico."
00:55:27 - 00:56:13 (46 sec),"Mexico is not too far away, and we need to take care of our people and we're going to do that and it's happening and it's happening a lot faster than anybody thought. And I love that sign. Thank you. What we're proposing includes humanitarian assistance, drug detection at our ports and everywhere else, closing legal loopholes, which is a big problem, and plans for a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier or wall, let's call it a wall, it's better."
00:56:13 - 00:56:52 (40 sec),"This wall will be built in the areas identified by border agents is having the greatest need while safely directing people and commerce to our many lawful ports of entry, which we're beefing up in every way, structurally, with beefing up the ports of entry and mechanically. We have equipment now that can spot drugs."
00:56:52 - 00:57:31 (38 sec),"It's incredible stuff. It's expensive. It's incredible. By the way, there is nothing better than a good old-fashioned German Shepherd. It's hard to believe, right. It's true you know, I -- I was with the people and they're showing me this incredible computerized stuff and where it goes. I said ""Could I -- ""Because Secret Service took me out to the place and they were showing me these German Shepherds, they're unbelievable."
00:57:31 - 00:58:04 (33 sec),"They'll run past all these empty boxes and one of the boxes has drugs in it, deep down in a box and they come to a screeching halt barking at it every time. So I asked the people that sell the machinery, at a lot of money, so I said, ""Let me ask you a question. This stuff is incredible. I'm really impressed."
00:58:04 - 00:58:47 (43 sec),"How does it compare to a German Shepherd?"" The guy looks at and says, ""Sir, honestly, it's not as good."" Can you believe it? A German Shepard. Certain types of dogs, pretty good. You do love your dogs, don't you? I wouldn't mind having one, honestly, but I don't have any time, I don't have -- How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn, would that be -- Right, sort of not for -- I don't know, it doesn't -- I don't feel good."
00:58:47 - 00:59:23 (35 sec),"It feels a little phony-phony to me. A lot of people say, ""Oh, you should get a dog."" ""Why?"" ""It's good politically."" I said, ""Look, that's not the relationship I have with my people. We want -- "" [Audience members yells something about Obama] Yeah, Obama had a dog, you're right. [Laughter] Both parties should come together to finally create a safe and lawful system of immigration."
00:59:23 - 01:00:13 (51 sec),"The American people have waited long enough. We must secure the border, pass Kate's Law -- end Catch and Release, shutdown Sanctuary Cities -- you know, we need Democrat votes to do that -- deport criminal aliens, and keep the coyotes and traffickers and drug dealers the hell out of our country, please. And the Democrats also need to confirm the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are sitting in the Senate waiting for confirmation, people that have given up their lives to work in the Trump administration and the Democrats aren't approving them."
01:00:13 - 01:00:35 (22 sec),"It's a record. [Audience Boos] It's total obstruction. It's a record of the history of our country there has never been -- Some people left the job a year and a half ago, two years ago, to become an ambassador or to work at one of our many great agencies and we can't get Schumer and his friends to approve them."
01:00:35 - 01:01:00 (25 sec),"It's total obstruction. There's never been anything like it. Very, very unfair, very unfair to these people. In many cases, seriously, they've left jobs and they're waiting and waiting and waiting, they're slow walking every single one of them. It's a disgrace. As we fight to protect our borders we must also protect our newfound prosperity."
01:01:00 - 01:01:42 (42 sec),"My administration has taken the toughest ever action to crack down on years of China's abuse and its trade practices have been very unfair. And I have a lot of respect for President Xi, but he's representing China and I'm representing the United States. We're also replacing one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever done, although I happen to think that the WTO is not so good either, we're replacing NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that everybody is loving."
01:01:42 - 01:02:01 (19 sec),"We've got to get Congress to approve it. We've got to get Congress to approve. We'll get it, I think done. I mean, there's such obstruction in Congress, you know, they won't even do things that are good for our country now. They would rather have Trump have a loss than get something that's so good for our country."
01:02:01 - 01:02:20 (19 sec),"Our farmers are happy, everybody's happy. And it's going to be jobs. You know, what it does? It stops companies from moving out. It makes it very hard economically for companies to say, ""Hey, thanks a lot. We're firing everybody, we're moving to Mexico."" Makes it very, very hard. You know, that's been a bone of contention for me for many years."
01:02:20 - 01:02:47 (27 sec),"I've seen 25 percent and more of our automobile business move to Mexico and it's not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. Unless they want to pay nice big fat tariffs to send their cars back into this country We've achieved, and by the way, tariffs had have had an incredible effect. Just ask the folks in China, ""How are we doing with tariffs?"" You ask."
01:02:47 - 01:03:23 (36 sec),"And you ask, ""How are we doing in our negotiations?"" The fact is, and I say it openly, either they treat us fairly or they have to pay for the privilege of coming in and taking our wealth and taking our jobs, it's very simple. It's very, very simple. And if you look back at our country when we were very rich, when we had no debt, when we had no problems economically, you take back -- you take a look, 1888, the Great Tariff Debate, you know the debate was about?"
01:03:23 - 01:03:45 (22 sec),"Our country had so much money they had to debate what the hell to do with all the money because tariffs were bringing in a fortune into the United States. So at a minimum, countries in negotiating with us very seriously because of the fact that they don't want to have to pay to come in and take advantage of our country, that's at a minimum."
01:03:45 - 01:04:23 (38 sec),"Check it out, 188. Have the press check it out. They'll say, ""Donald Trump said 1888."" [Audience Laughs] We've achieved the largest decline in drug prices in 46 years, prescription drugs. And I'm asking Congress to work with me to make prescription drugs affordable for every American family. We just got the largest decrease in drug prices, think of that, and it's not easy, it's not easy."
01:04:23 - 01:04:43 (20 sec),"Because we have middlemen that take care of a lot of people for a lot of years, these middlemen and the drug companies, but even worse, the middleman, and we're cutting the middleman out. they're not going to like be very much. They made a lot of money. But think of that, they're better the first time in 46 years."
01:04:43 - 01:05:15 (32 sec),"And now we're going to phase three, we did one statutorily, we did two statutorily, now we go to phase three, we're getting your drug prices down. We're embarking on bald initiatives to defeat AIDS. Who knew that? We have medicines now that work wonders on AIDS. We're looking to be AIDS-free in not many years as a country and maybe help, also, the world, the world."
01:05:15 - 01:05:48 (33 sec),"So we want to defeat AIDS and we want to feed childhood cancer. We've made tremendous strides. Tremendous strides. In the Middle East, are brave warriors have liberated virtually 100 percent of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Now, you don't hear that from these people. Now, we've taken back -- soon it'll be announced soon, maybe over the next week, maybe less, but it'll be announced very soon -- we'll have 100 percent."
01:05:48 - 01:06:07 (18 sec),"When I took over this country, it was a mess. And if I wouldn't have been elected -- You know, I have so many people, I was just walking up and every time it happens, ""Sir, thank you. Thank you very much."" This guy, he's -- he's like a monster. No, no, it's true. These people. This guy is like a monster."
01:06:07 - 01:06:28 (21 sec),"He's like this monster football -- a big, strong guy. He says to me, he said, ""Thank you very much."" I don't know what they're saying, but that's okay. Now he's this big, strong guy and he's crying. And he said, ""Mr. -- "" I'm walking up and it happens all the time. ""Thank you very much, Mr. President."" I said, ""For what?"" He said, ""You've saved our country."
01:06:28 - 01:06:54 (26 sec),"Our country was going in the wrong direction. You've saved our country. Thank you."" I've had so many people say that. So many people. You know what the truth is though? I didn't save our country, we're now heading in the right direction. It's very tough because we have so many things were fighting, including these people."
01:06:54 - 01:07:17 (23 sec),"But so many people that we're finding, so many people that are either foolish or ill-intentioned. But you know, I didn't save our county, you know saved our country, you saved our country. You saved our country, and God. Because there's never -- nothing like this has ever happened before. And you know what?"
01:07:17 - 01:07:48 (30 sec),"The world is watching and when prime ministers, and when presidents, and kings and queens, they talked to me they say, ""Congratulations on what's happened with your economy, Mr. President, it's incredible."" They're emulating what we're doing. They can't believe it. So we continue to decimate the remnants, because they're always going to be remnants, we can take the area the land, we'll soon have 100 percent, but they're always remnants, they get out, they wrap themselves in bombs."
01:07:48 - 01:08:30 (42 sec),"They're crazy. They're lunatics. But you're always going to have that. But we want to bring, now -- we've got 100 percent. It was so bad when I took over, it was going the opposite direction. Syria, we want to bring our troops back home. It's time. It's time. It's time. And thanks to the extraordinary service of our military in Afghanistan, 19 years we're in Afghanistan, we may now be able to seek a political resolution that, frankly, they've wanted to talk about for a long time."
01:08:30 - 01:08:55 (26 sec),"We've hit them very hard, but it's been 19 years. Think of that, 19 years. We spend more on military in Afghanistan, $50 billion a year, than most countries spend on their entire country, healthcare, education, everything. We spend more than they do. It's time to start thinking smart for our country. What we want to build our country."
01:08:55 - 01:09:33 (38 sec),"We want to spend money in our country. We want to build our roads, and highways, and bridges, and dams. And last month the United States recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and condemned the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. [Audience Boos] Everywhere socialism has been, everywhere it's been implemented, it's produced poverty, misery, repression, and despair."
01:09:33 - 01:10:35 (61 sec),"You take a look no matter where. Yet, there are those trying to implement socialism right here in the United States. So I, again, say to you -- [Audience Boos] -- and I say it for the world to hear, America will never be a Socialist country, never, never. [Audience chants USA] We're born free. We will live free and we will die free."
01:10:35 - 01:11:20 (46 sec),"We will always be free. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and our great rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American way."
01:11:20 - 01:11:41 (21 sec),"We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our incredible history, and always respect our great American flag. We believe that the first duty of government is to be loyal to its citizens."
01:11:41 - 01:12:18 (37 sec),"And we live by the words of our national motto that we are going to keep -- we'll never change this -- In God We Trust. These are the beliefs, traditions, and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as great patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the great State of Texas."
01:12:18 - 01:13:07 (49 sec),"From Houston to Austin, from Dallas to El Paso -- from the Red River to the Rio Grande, the Lone Star State embodies the spirit of independence like maybe no other place anywhere in the world. And you have always embraced the cause of American Freedom like no one else. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo."
01:13:07 - 01:13:46 (38 sec),"This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzalez, armed with a single cannon, stared down a foreign, powerful army and declared, ""Come and take it."" Come on, come on, take it. Texas is the state where generations of farmers, ranchers, oil workers, and pioneers help build up the most extraordinary nation in all of human history."
01:13:46 - 01:14:18 (32 sec),"That's what we are. We were losing track, we didn't lose track getting more, we're just great on that track. Now, just like generations of Texas patriots who came before, you are going to make your stand. That's what we've done, we've made our stand and we've made it together. This is a big group of millions and millions of people that have come together like never before in our history."
01:14:18 - 01:15:31 (73 sec),"This has never happened before. And we've come for safety, for sovereignty, and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America. And together, with the proud and incredible and great people of the State of Texas, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:01:07 (67 sec),"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much, Grand Rapids. It's great to be back. Right here in America's heartland. You know that, right? With the hard-working patriots from the great state of Michigan. By the way we are bringing a lot of those car companies back. Remember I told you they are coming back?"
00:01:07 - 00:01:47 (40 sec),They are pouring back in. They are coming back. They are coming back fast. This has been an incredible couple of weeks for America. The economy is roaring. The ISIS caliphate is defeated 100 percent. And after three years of lies and smears and slander the Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over.
00:01:47 - 00:02:43 (56 sec),"The Special Counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction. I could have told you that two and a half years ago very easily. Total exoneration. Complete vindication. You know, it's interesting Robert Mueller was a God to the Democrats, was a God to them until he said there was no collusion."
00:02:43 - 00:03:52 (69 sec),"They don't like him so much right now. The crazy attempt by the Democrat party and the fake news media right back there -- And the deep state to overturn the results of the 2016 election have failed, the greatest election that we've had in a long time may be right from the beginning. [Audience Chants Trump] This was nothing more than a sinister effort to undermine our historic election victory and to sabotage the will of the American people."
00:03:52 - 00:04:41 (49 sec),"This is the one we want. We want ourselves. We want us and that's what we got. We came from all over to vote. They've never taken it away from us, never. Never. Our movement took on the political establishment, the corrupt media and it's never been more corrupt than it is today. And many special interests, that's why they tried to do everything possible to take us out but we are very tough to take out aren't we? Very, very, very."
00:04:41 - 00:05:43 (61 sec),"The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and eat illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans, many of them. They suffered with an elaborate hoax. They wanted to destroy a movement like our country has never seen before. That's true. Never seen before. And believe me, if these people thought that that wasn't true, they would be writing it. They've never seen anything like it. Nobody has in this country's history and in most countries histories there has never been anything like what we did in 2016 on November 8. We defeated a very corrupt establishment and we kept our promise to the American people and it's driving them crazy."
00:05:43 - 00:06:08 (25 sec),"Today our movement and our country are thriving. Their fraud has been exposed and the credibility of those who pushed this hoax is forever broken and they've now got big problems. And the harm done to our country -- think of what they've done. Think of the time wasted and yet despite this terrible cloud, this phony, corrupt, disgusting cloud we have done more together in the first two years than any administration in the history of our country."
00:06:08 - 00:06:39 (31 sec),"And this group of major losers did not just ruthlessly attack me, my family, and everyone who questioned their lies, they tried to divide our country, to poison the national debate, and to tear up the fabric of our great democracy, the greatest anywhere in the world. They did it all because they refuse to accept the results of one of the greatest Presidential elections, probably number one in our history."
00:06:39 - 00:07:14 (35 sec),"Many, many people were badly hurt by this scam. But more importantly our country was hurt. Our country was hurt and they're on artificial respirators right now. [Laughter] They are getting mouth to mouth resuscitation. Little pencil-neck Adam Schiff. He's got the smallest, thinnest neck I've ever seen. [Laughter] He is not a long ball hitter but I saw him today well, we don't really know."
00:07:14 - 00:07:32 (18 sec),"There could still have been some Russia collusion. Sick. Sick. These are sick people and there has to be accountability because it's all lies and they know it's lies. They know it. They know it. Jerry Nadler, I've been fighting him for many years. He was the Congressman from Manhattan. I built great things in Manhattan."
00:07:32 - 00:08:16 (44 sec),"I had to beat him many, many times. Now I come here, I have to beat him again. Can you believe? I want every record in the history of the Trump organization. Every single sheet of paper. And what do you have to justify? Nothing. It doesn't matter. We will find something somewhere along the line. A mistake must have been made."
00:08:16 - 00:08:56 (40 sec),"These people are sick. Sick. Every single deal. Every single paper. All of the Democrat politicians, the media bosses bad people. The crooked journalist, the totally dishonest TV pundits and by the way they know it's not true. They just got great readings. By the way their ratings dropped through the floor last night."
00:08:56 - 00:09:35 (39 sec),"Did you see that? And our friends Tucker, Sean, Laura through the roof last night. And all of the current and former officials who paid for, promoted, and perpetuated the single greatest hoax in the history of politics in our country they have to be -- I'm sorry. They have to be accountable. Just think of. A fake, dirty dossier millions and millions of dollars paid for it. By who?"
00:09:35 - 00:10:28 (53 sec),"Crooked Hillary Clinton, the DNC and the Democrat party. Think of it. This is what they used. But they failed. They failed in one way. Can you believe it? Maybe I got lucky. Maybe I got lucky because the fake news they wouldn't put it on. Even they didn't be leave it. Think of it, they spent millions of dollars and the deal was they get it published or printed all of these horrible lies, all now totally exposed as fake."
00:10:28 - 00:11:02 (33 sec),They were going to get it printed just before the election and they couldn't get any of the media to print it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. You never know. You never know. You lose a few vote and that could be the difference but they wouldn't print it so I will tell you on that score I give the media a lot of credit.
00:11:02 - 00:11:33 (31 sec),"It came out after the election and everybody had a big, fat yawn. [Laughter] And I heard about Russia. I'd be running, I'd be hearing -- they'd say something about Russia. I'd say Russia, what does that have to do -- ? This went on. Little -- and then all of the sudden I hear were you involved with Russia?"
00:11:33 - 00:12:08 (35 sec),"I say Russia? What the hell does Russia have to do with my campaign? It's true. Russia. Russia. You know I go up to Wisconsin where she didn't go, she was told you know many, many years, decades, since a Republican one although Bill Clinton said he was in Wisconsin and you'd better get up there, there are a lot of signs up saying Trump Pence, a lot of signs."
00:12:08 - 00:12:28 (20 sec),"A lot of those signs. You'd better get up there darling. And they said no, no, no. Don't worry about Wisconsin because you know Wisconsin the pollsters say we're doing great. They don't come to a place called Michigan. Have you ever heard of Michigan? Michigan. And Bill Clinton said you know I was in Michigan, you'd better get to Michigan."
00:12:28 - 00:13:23 (55 sec),"It's not looking good. They have so many of those damn signs. Every place I look they have the sign on somebody's lawn. You'd better get up to -- know, Michigan hasn't been lost in decades by the Dems. By the Dems. Hasn't been lost. And if you remember this was my last stop. This was it. And I'll never forget this was a spur of the moment because I heard crooked Hillary and Bill, Barack Obama and Michelle -- they were all headed here, right, at the last moment."
00:13:23 - 00:14:04 (41 sec),"They had a tiny, little crowd and I had I'd like to say more but I can't have more than this because every seat is gone and outside you have 25,000 people. And I remember leaving and I said so she's got 500 people and I had 32,000 people including the people outside. I will tell you we have more tonight because outside we have even more than we did then."
00:14:04 - 00:14:32 (28 sec),"And I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning so it's now election day. In fact I actually said am I allowed to do this? It's 1 o'clock in the morning. I had made six speeches and when I heard she was coming I said you know what, what the hell. [Laughter] So it was spur of the moment, last second. We called and we had 32,000 people including all of the people outside."
00:14:32 - 00:15:07 (35 sec),"She had [Inaudible]. I said so let me explain. Let me ask. So she's here at prime time 730, I'm here at one in the morning. She has 500 or 600 people, I have 32,000. Can you explain why am I going to lose Michigan? Why? Why am I going to lose Michigan? Why am I going to lose the great state? I was asking my people."
00:15:07 - 00:15:45 (38 sec),"I get home at 4 o'clock in the morning and I told our great First Lady, soon to be first lady -- and she's doing a great job. They love her. I said you know I have this incredible crowd and I didn't start speaking until 1 o'clock in the morning. I said how the hell could I lose Michigan and guess what we didn't lose Michigan."
00:15:45 - 00:16:32 (47 sec),"And you know what, we didn't lose Wisconsin either. And the fact is we won a lot of places that night. We won Pennsylvania. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won Florida. We ran the East Coast. We won Iowa, you'd better believe Iowa. We love Iowa. We won. We won a lot. We won a lot. Well, we 306 to 223. Would you say that's good?"
00:16:32 - 00:17:11 (39 sec),"I say that's good. Because of here. Remember they said there is no way -- . The day of the election I'm saying you know this is pretty lousy. It's all fake news. You know they are trying to put it in your head. They go there is no way to 270. In other words I needed 270 to win. There is no way for Donald Trump, I wasn't President."
00:17:11 - 00:17:53 (42 sec),"Then, I was a little short of President There is no way on CNN for Donald Trump, remember the red board? It was so red; the red was killing -- they were dying. There is no way for 270 for Donald Trump. It will be a very short evening for Donald Trump there just is no way and they were right. We didn't get 270. We got 306. But in this country -- [Audience chants Four more years] But in this country, we cannot criminalize political differences, political differences."
00:17:53 - 00:18:20 (27 sec),We do not abuse the law enforcement and intelligence power to target our political opponents when they spy on me. Whoever heard of this? They spied on me. They spied on our campaign. Who would think that's possible? The single greatest political hoax in the history of our country and guess what? We won. It's a beautiful thing.
00:18:20 - 00:18:45 (25 sec),"It's a beautiful thing. We love to win. They tried to take something great away from people that came from all over. I always say, they came from the valleys, they came from the mountains, they came out of the damn rivers. I don't know what you were doing in the river but they came from the cities. They came and they came and they didn't even know these people existed."
00:18:45 - 00:19:08 (23 sec),"They are hard-working. They are successful, they are the smartest people, they are the toughest people, they are the most loyal people. They are. They are the smartest. Remember this about yourself. You know I always hear the easily, the release. Well, I always said they said it. I said it here my last night."
00:19:08 - 00:19:42 (34 sec),"I always say they say the easily. They are the elite, I am not. Well, I have a better education than them, I'm smarter than them. I went to the best schools, they didn't. Much more beautiful house, much more beautiful apartment, much more beautiful everything. And I'm President and they are not, right? And then they say the elite, the elite."
00:19:42 - 00:20:07 (25 sec),"They are not elite, you are the elite. We are the elite. I get a kick. I hear so and so the elite. Then you see this guy, like this little schlepper, this is elite? I'm not elite. This is elite. We are the elite. You are smarter. You are sharper. You are more loyal. You are a hell of a lot tougher. A hell of a lot tougher."
00:20:07 - 00:20:29 (22 sec),"So we can't have two different standards of justice in our country. One where the left wing radical establishment can get away with anything they want. But you know, I have to tell you. I said it last night, we have some great, great friends in the media too. You look at Rush and Sean -- And Laura and Steve and Ainsley and Tucker and Jeanine."
00:20:29 - 00:21:19 (50 sec),"Jeanine is back, going to be back on Saturday night. Jeanine, right? And even Greg likes me now. Greg. He started a little slow but he likes Trump. But we have a lot of great support. We really do. We have a lot of great support. Far more than you think but where we really have the support are the voters that pull that handle or whatever the hell they are pulling they are pulling it for us. So the Russia hoax proves more than ever that we need to finish exactly what we came here to do. Drain the swamp."
00:21:19 - 00:21:47 (28 sec),"The Democrats have to now decide whether they will continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bullshit -- Partisan investigations or whether they will apologize to the American people and join us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, bring down the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs which we are doing incredibly, help us fix our broken trade deals which are coming along really well."
00:21:47 - 00:22:14 (27 sec),"We have our team right now in China. They just arrived. China. China. We've gone up, they've gone down but we want them to be healthy. We want them to be happy and healthy. China. And by the way we are building the wall as us -- , we are building that wall. Building -- We are building that wall. [Audience chants build that wall] We had to go down a little bit of a different path but that's okay."
00:22:14 - 00:22:46 (33 sec),"National emergency it is. And if you look at the border and you look at the hundreds of thousands of people that are invading or at least trying to invade our country you would know that we needed and we are building it. And we are building it a lot faster than anybody would -- and better, and better. It's better."
00:22:46 - 00:23:34 (47 sec),"It's faster and it's less expensive. And it's also much more beautiful. And we are building it very rapidly. It's moving along and we renovated vast amounts of wall. A lot of it was in bad shape, we renovated it for 25 cents on the dollar. That's okay, too, right? That's good too. The fake news doesn't want to give us any credit for renovation."
00:23:34 - 00:24:09 (35 sec),"They say even if you rip it down and build a brand-new wall where the wall was, they call that a renovation. That's not a renovation for me. That's not. They do anything they can to -- you're right. Shifty Schiff. They do whatever they can do sort of make it look not so good. We are really doing well but we have a problem."
00:24:09 - 00:25:09 (60 sec),"Our country has never been better economically and people are trying to get in and they have to come in legally and they have to come in based on merit. Based on merit. Despite all that we have been forced to endure every day we are working and fighting and winning. Remember that because we are making America great again and we are making a great for all Americans, all Americans."
00:25:09 - 00:25:35 (26 sec),"And it's getting to be that time, very important. MAGA country. You heard the other day. How about in Chicago? He said -- He said he was attacked by MAGA country. Did you ever hear that one? I don't know -- . May be the only time I've ever agreed with the Mayor of Chicago. That's a terrible situation. That's an embarrassment not only to Chicago."
00:25:35 - 00:26:03 (28 sec),That is an embarrassment to our country what took place there. Remember that. But they are looking at it. So we are delighted to be joined this evening by some really incredible people. People that love you. Members of Congress. Bill Huizenga. Where is Bill? Bill Huizenga. Where is he? Where the hell is he? You didn't get a very good location.
00:26:03 - 00:26:35 (32 sec),"[Laughter] You didn't get a good bill. You did not get a great location but we have some news. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. And Jack Bergman. Thank you, Jack. So here's something good. You ready? In honor of those guys and some of your other representatives and all that we think are fantastic we have some breaking news."
00:26:35 - 00:27:18 (43 sec),"You ready? I don't know. Can you handle it? I don't think you can handle it. I support the Great Lakes. Always have. They are beautiful. They are big, very deep, record deepness, right? And I'm going to get in honor of my friends full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative -- Which you have been trying to get for over 30 years."
00:27:18 - 00:28:02 (44 sec),"So we will get it done. It's time. It's time. It's time. You been trying to get it over 30 years. I would say it's time. Right? Also and as you know this one, we have already pretty much locked up, I'll say locked up. You all understand that because we are very close to getting started on the beautiful new Soo Locks that people have wanted to build for a very, very long time."
00:28:02 - 00:28:39 (37 sec),So we are very close to finishing that one off. And by the way don't let your new Democrat Governor -- or don't let -- Don't let any of our people that find us all of the way now that we have it take credit for it. Okay? Don't let it. Don't let it. You are too smart for that. We are also joined this evening by the Speaker of the Michigan House Lee Chatfield.
00:28:39 - 00:29:22 (43 sec),"Thank you, leave. Thanks, Lee. A person who is doing a fantastic job GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox. And a woman you know very well, she headed up Michigan. They said she was wasting her time, Trump is never going to win Michigan. I said but I'm going to bring back your auto business. Remember? And I did, and I did."
00:29:22 - 00:30:20 (58 sec),"And when we won, I said who is that woman? I want to see her and we put her in charge of the RNC, Republican National Committee. Ronna McDaniel. Ronna. And a friend of mine, he used show but he's very rich he shouldn't be shy. He's one of the biggest builders and real estate people in the world, one of the biggest owners of property."
00:30:20 - 00:30:47 (27 sec),"I shouldn't introduce them because you guys will like him because he's a big owner of property but you own -- you own property, he just owns more of it than you do. [Laughter] And he's a great guy and he's been with me from the beginning, Stanley Chera. Stanley. Those big beautiful buildings in Manhattan."
00:30:47 - 00:31:11 (25 sec),"You know those big beautiful buildings? He owns it. Stanley, how much did you make this month? [Laughter] Stanley is a great guy. Been with us all. He loves you and he's been with us from the beginning and we've had a lot of people with us. We've had people you wouldn't believe we've had a lot of support."
00:31:11 - 00:31:36 (24 sec),"In the last two years we've embarked on an unprecedented economic revival. Unprecedented. America is now the hottest economy anywhere on the planet Earth. There's nobody close. Since our election when the stock market is up almost 50 percent. You are looking like geniuses with your 401(k)s, right? Your wife or your husband is saying darling, you're such a great investor."
00:31:36 - 00:32:15 (39 sec),"How are we doing? We are up 67 percent. Oh, darling, you're so brilliant. [Laughter] In your whole life you've been criticized by her or him but all of the sudden they think you are the single greatest investor. Thank you, Donald. [Laughter] By the way if you want to see those 401(k)s and all of your stocks and all of the things that you own, you want to see them deflate put a good socialist in this position."
00:32:15 - 00:32:55 (39 sec),"Go get yourself a good socialist. You'll see some deflation. You'll see a nice deflate of your stocks and your bonds and your 401(k). We have created since my election 5.5 million new jobs. Nobody would have believed that was possible. Including 600,000 brand-new -- remember, this couldn't happen. You need a magic wand."
00:32:55 - 00:33:22 (28 sec),"Brand-new manufacturing jobs. Well, how did that happen? We were going to have any new man -- it was going down 600,000 and it's going to be increasing by a lot because you have a lot of companies pouring into Michigan and your other great states. A lot. More manufacturing jobs in fact were created in 2018 than in the year in more than 21 years."
00:33:22 - 00:33:58 (35 sec),"That's not bad. That's not bad. And that's not even one of our better statistics. That's actually like at the bottom of the pack. Do you believe me? After years of stagnation wages are rising fast. Do you remember I use to say that people made more money 21 years ago? All of the time and they had one job then they did -- this is two, three years ago, right, than they did working two and three jobs now."
00:33:58 - 00:34:32 (34 sec),"True. But now wages are rising. You have your choice of jobs like I got choice for the veterans, we also got choice for people wanting jobs. So wages are rising substantially for those people. You are doing great but they are also rising most quickly for the lowest income Americans. First time in decades."
00:34:32 - 00:35:07 (35 sec),"And here's a statistic that I love because blue-collar jobs recently grew at the fastest pace in more than 30 years. Whoever thought, right? 30 years. And unemployment has reached the lowest rate in 51 years and soon it will be in the history of our country. 51 years. And to me very important, you remember I use to say what do you have to lose?"
00:35:07 - 00:35:47 (40 sec),"What do you have to lose, right? And I got criticized. You shouldn't say that. I said well, it's true. It's unfair. So importantly to me African-American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment and unemployment among disabled Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:35:47 - 00:36:29 (42 sec),And you remember in the last election they said Donald Trump will not do well with women. I said really? I said really? No. All of the fake news they said you will not do well with women and maybe they didn't want to say they like me to be honest. That I can understand. And then the election came and they said whatever happened to the fact that he wasn't going to do well with women because we did really well with women.
00:36:29 - 00:36:59 (30 sec),"Right? Right? Remember when I was sitting back a couple of them were trying, remember one of the true killers she was crying not from happiness. But we did great with women. We did great with women and I think we are going to do better with women now because you know what? I produced. Because women filled more than 60 percent of all new jobs created last year."
00:36:59 - 00:37:44 (45 sec),"60 percent. Think about. 60 percent. So that means the men better get moving, folks. You are falling behind. The women are -- they are beating you pretty good men. Get going. The women got 60 percent of all of the new jobs. I mean that's an incredible number. We've cut the greatest number of regulations in two years in the history of our country."
00:37:44 - 00:38:20 (37 sec),"Not for two years, in the history of our country. That's one of the things helping us with the jobs. And the United States people don't even believe this, it all happened very recently is now the number one oil and gas producer in the world. Number one. Number one. And by the way Russia is not happy about that but they are fine."
00:38:20 - 00:38:50 (30 sec),"They are doing just fine but they are not happy about that. If Hillary got in you wouldn't have that stat, I can tell you right now. You would be doing wind, windmills and if it doesn't -- if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night. [Laughter] Darling, I want to watch television. I'm sorry, the wind isn't blowing."
00:38:50 - 00:39:39 (49 sec),"I know a lot about wind. I know a lot about wind. We passed massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country. And very importantly for those people with small farms and businesses we got rid of the death tax or the estate tax. So now when you leave your farm or small business to your children under the assumption that you like your children, some people don't. Some people say I wouldn't leave it to them under any circumstances."
00:39:39 - 00:40:15 (36 sec),"I can't stand my kids but for those of you that do which I assume is hopefully a vast majority you don't have an estate tax to pay, they don't. So they can take over your farm, they can take over your business, they don't have to mortgage it to the hilt and then the bank comes in five years later takes it away from your kids."
00:40:15 - 00:40:59 (44 sec),"No tax. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate penalty. The most unpopular part and we are going to hopefully in the court -- in Texas you heard we won the case, now it has to be appealed and then we will go to the United States Supreme Court. We have a chance of killing Obamacare. We almost did it but somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down but we will do it a different way."
00:40:59 - 00:41:32 (33 sec),"You know what, we will do it a different way but we got rid of the individual mandate where you were forced to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to buy bad healthcare. Okay? Not too good. So we are going to get rid of Obamacare. And I said it the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great healthcare."
00:41:32 - 00:41:58 (26 sec),It's good. It's important. And we have created new options to help Americans purchase affordable health plans all across state lines. You now have options you would have never had. The Democrats are pushing socialist government-run healthcare that bans private healthcare for 180 million Americans. Now think of it. A lot of you have private plans and they are great.
00:41:58 - 00:42:28 (31 sec),"They are great and you want that. They want to take them away. That's not going to work. I don't think that's going to work too well. Republicans want you to have an affordable plan that's just right for you and by the way you can use your doctor, remember that? That was a lie. 28 times, 28 times he said that was a lie."
00:42:28 - 00:43:04 (36 sec),"You get cheaper premiums in much lower deductibles. The deductibles and Obamacare are so high on average $7000. You don't get to use it unless a really great tragedy hits and then you don't really want it because you don't give a damn about your deductible, right? You will be in a position where you say who cares about the deductible."
00:43:04 - 00:43:32 (28 sec),"Let's see if I can live. We believe that no one in America should be bankrupted by health care cost and that's what's happening with Obamacare. And remember this because it's very important and I'm speaking now for the Republican party, we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always."
00:43:32 - 00:44:05 (33 sec),Always. My administration has also begun the bold initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and in 2018 drug prices saw their first decline in 46 years. First time. First time. And they will be coming down a lot but this is the first time in 46 years that prescription drugs came down. Even Stanley likes that because he needs plenty of them.
00:44:05 - 00:44:39 (34 sec),"And then we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our amazing veterans. Our amazing veterans. They have been trying to get VA Choice for over 40 years. They couldn't do it. I got it. We signed it six months ago. Now instead of waiting online for one day, one week, two months people that were okay but not feeling well, wait so long that they become terminally ill."
00:44:39 - 00:45:16 (37 sec),"There was no reason for it. Now they go outside, they see a private doctor, we pay the bill, they get better quickly. And for 46 years VA Accountability you couldn't fire anybody in the VA. We had sadists. They took advantage in so many ways of our great veterans. They were rough, they wouldn't have hit them in prime time by the way, not in prime time."
00:45:16 - 00:46:03 (47 sec),"In prime time they would say okay, I don't want to touch you. I'm not going to play. They took advantage of people that are our great heroes that protected us and you couldn't fire them. They stole, they robbed. You couldn't fire them. It didn't matter what you did you couldn't fire them. Called accountability."
00:46:03 - 00:46:40 (37 sec),"We passed seven months ago today we passed VA Accountability. You heard our vets, you stole from us. Guess what, Bill? You're fired. You're fired. Get out. You're fired. And to give former prisoners a second chance I proudly signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. They have been trying to do that for so many years."
00:46:40 - 00:47:12 (33 sec),"So many years. Very unfair. And by the way some of the people that most supported it are the most conservative people you've ever seen. Both, both sides. Very bipartisan believe it or not for a change. But while we are pushing and pursuing all of these commonsense policies to advance the common good for our citizens Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism, resistance."
00:47:12 - 00:47:47 (34 sec),"Resist. Resist and revenge. Revenge. What do you think of their signs resist? What the hell? Let's get something done, right? Resist. Resist. Resist. Isn't that weird? You know you are looking to have a parade that's called resist. You say what the hell does that mean? No, no. We want to do legislation. There are so many things we can be doing together."
00:47:47 - 00:48:20 (33 sec),The Democrats are now advancing an extreme $100 trillion government takeover called the Green New Deal. But I'd rather not talk about it tonight because I don't want to talk them out of it too soon. [Laughter] Because I love campaigning against the Green New Deal. I want them to make they do a big part of their platform.
00:48:20 - 00:48:53 (33 sec),"No more airplanes, no more cows. One car per family. One car. You're going to love that in Michigan. Hey, how do you like the idea of one car per family? You know, I don't think one car per family in Michigan plays too well. Do you agree? Right? Not too well. And it's got to be of course an electric car even if it only goes what, 160 miles?"
00:48:53 - 00:49:27 (34 sec),"What do you do, it's 160 miles? Darling, where do I get a charge? Where do I get a charge, darling? No. We want to have a lot of cars per family. We want people to lead a great life and we want people to make those cars and we want all of these companies to keep coming to Michigan and all of the other great states and building those [Inaudible]. And we had a problem because when they didn't want the airplanes they were saying well, how do you get to Europe?"
00:49:27 - 00:49:57 (29 sec),"Nobody knew. How do you get to Australia? Nobody knew but they are working on it and then they were interviewing this woman from Hawaii, the Senator. The one that was so vicious about Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. Remember? By the way, do we love Justice Gorsuch and do we love Justice Kavanaugh?"
00:49:57 - 00:50:25 (29 sec),"She was so vicious to both and these are great people. She was vicious and they hit her. She didn't know about the Green New Deal and they hit her and she's from Hawaii. What do you think of the Green New Deal? It was just put up by the Democrats. Well, I like it very much but she never saw it. Then they said but you can't fly anymore and she's in Hawaii."
00:50:25 - 00:50:51 (25 sec),"She said but how would I get to my island? They said we are working on some kind of a train system. [Laughter] So she said okay, well then, I am for it 100 percent. It is the craziest thing I have ever seen. They want to rip down all of the buildings in Manhattan and rebuild them. Let's do that. Hey, Stanley, how do you like that idea?"
00:50:51 - 00:51:16 (25 sec),"I don't think so. I don't think Stanley likes that idea too much. It's the craziest thing but you know what, let's let them -- . It's like I attack so violently Pocahontas and -- And I knocked her out of the race I guess and I said what did I do that for? It's too early. I've got to start in about nine months from now."
00:51:16 - 00:51:42 (27 sec),"We've got plenty more to knock out, you're right. They just keep coming, don't they? They just keep coming. Before I took the oath of office the United States automobile industry was decimated and it was going down and you people knew it better than anybody else. We lost one in four auto manufacturing jobs over the last few decades."
00:51:42 - 00:52:21 (39 sec),"Think of it, one in four and I think the numbers were worse than that and so do you. But from the moment I entered the White House my first meeting was a meeting with car executives. I said what do I have to do to get your business going? We talked about CAFE standards where they were choking the engines, just choking them and costing a lot more for the cars and we had a great meeting and we worked on it and worked on it. We took historic and dramatic action to save the American auto industry and to defend American auto workers right here in Michigan."
00:52:21 - 00:52:55 (34 sec),"Right. And just in the last very short period of time we have added another 6000 vehicle manufacturing and auto parts jobs in Michigan alone and prevented thousands more from being shipped overseas and from going to Mexico. They can't do that anymore. Can't do that. Can't do that anymore. Sorry, Mexico."
00:52:55 - 00:53:22 (26 sec),"We want them to give us a little more help on the border by the way. You know Mexico has the toughest immigration laws in the world. We have the worst because the Democrats put in things that are so bad, so bad. Catch and release. You catch them and then you got to release them. Think of it. Visa lottery."
00:53:22 - 00:54:08 (46 sec),"You are in a lottery system from these countries. You pick up a name. Isn't that nice? Guess what? Do you think they are giving us their best people? No, they are not. They are giving us their worst people and so would you and so would I. Visa lottery. That's another beauty. We have nothing but bad coming out of those laws but you know the good thing about what's happening, the rush to the border, another two caravans now are pouring up. Mexico could stop them so easy and you know what?"
00:54:08 - 00:54:49 (41 sec),If they don't it's going to cost them a hell of a lot of money honestly because they could do it so easy. So easy. And if they don't and I'm telling you right now we will close the damn border. [Audience chants USA] And I don't know if you know it or not Michigan but Mexico took about 30 percent of your car business.
00:54:49 - 00:55:09 (20 sec),Not when I was here. When I'm here they are not. It's going the other way. 30 percent and if we close the border that means we are not taking those cars into our country and what does that mean? That means you are going to make more cars right here in the good old USA. That's what it means. Right? Very simple.
00:55:09 - 00:55:37 (28 sec),"It's all very simple. People try and make it too complicated. It's all very simple. One of the gravest threats to the survival of the U.S. auto industry was the job-killing, sovereignty-wrecking Trans-Pacific Partnership. It was going to decimate your industry. That's why one of my very first acts in office was to withdraw our country from that horrible potentially disastrous trade deal."
00:55:37 - 00:56:06 (28 sec),"And stop the offshoring of Michigan jobs. Saved a lot of jobs. That was a disaster. That would have been almost as bad as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world. NAFTA. That was a beauty. Your empty factories are still all over the place. They still haven't recovered from NAFTA. Well, NAFTA is going to be a thing of the past."
00:56:06 - 00:56:35 (29 sec),"Soon. Or we will just go to pre-NAFTA, that was okay, too. We had a huge surplus with Mexico, then we did NAFTA. We lost over the last six, seven years with Mexico $100 billion. Before NAFTA, we made $40-$50 billion. Doesn't sound like too good a deal, right? So we have now the USMCA and it's very good."
00:56:35 - 00:56:57 (22 sec),"If the Democrats want to raise their hand -- it's a hard thing for them to give us a victory but let's see if they raise their hands otherwise, we go to pre-NAFTA. We don't go to NAFTA, we go to pre-NAFTA. That was just okay with me. That was okay with me. A short time later I traveled to Detroit to cancel burdensome regulations that unfairly harm the motor city."
00:56:57 - 00:57:22 (26 sec),It was getting decimated. We renegotiated the U.S. Korea trade agreement to double the American auto exports to Korea. We doubled them. They were not happy about it. And to stop the cheap foreign pickup trucks from flooding our market. That's your best market. Do you know why? Because we have a chicken tax.
00:57:22 - 00:57:52 (30 sec),"We have a tariff, 25 percent and that's why it's your best market because they can't come in here and take away your business and take away your jobs. They weren't thrilled but that's okay. Under my administration we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American. And we are already seeing good results."
00:57:52 - 00:58:31 (39 sec),"Since the election we have created more than 55,000 brand-new motor vehicle and auto parts jobs in our country. 55,000. Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion investment in Michigan including the first new auto plant in Detroit in over a generation. And they are going to be investing in our country $13.5 billion over a very short period of time."
00:58:31 - 00:59:09 (38 sec),"And Ford has just announced a $1 billion investment just outside of Chicago as well as additional $900 million going right here in Michigan. And I've been a little bit disappointed with them because everyone else is coming in but General Motors did just announce a $300 million investment at its Orion assembly plant here in Michigan, right now."
00:59:09 - 00:59:47 (38 sec),"But I'm also fighting with General Motors and the UAW to take swift action on the GM plants at Hamtramck and Warren, Michigan and Lordstown, Ohio. Get the damn plants open. Everyone else is coming in. Get them open now. Right? So with companies like Chrysler and Ford and Toyota and Volkswagen all investing heavily in America and heavily in the state of Michigan we think General Motors will soon be doing the same."
00:59:47 - 01:00:19 (32 sec),"I really do believe it. You know they went before my time they went to China, they spent a lot of money building stuff. They went to Mexico. They spent a lot of money building stuff. That's not helping us much. So we think they are going to come around. As we protect our jobs, we are also protecting America's borders and we are taking on the extremist and they are really radical, radical extremist Democrats who want open borders in crime because that's what happens."
01:00:19 - 01:00:43 (24 sec),"Open borders and crime. Last month alone more than 76,000 illegal immigrants arrived at our borders to be apprehended. We have to apprehend them. Do you know what a great job -- I mean seriously think of that, 76,000 people many of which are rough people. Okay, I'm being nice because they will criticize me if I'm not."
01:00:43 - 01:01:14 (31 sec),"They will say how dare he say that. But we have people that have criminal records. We have a lot of people. We have a lot of problems. We apprehend them. We capture them. Do you know how tough that job is, border patrol? You know how tough? I don't think any of you guys here -- yeah, you would. That guy would like it. There are some people would like it. They love it. The great American patriots and ICE, these are great American patriots."
01:01:14 - 01:01:33 (20 sec),"And we are on track for 1 million illegal aliens trying to rush our borders. It is an invasion, you know that. I say invasion. They say isn't that terrible? I don't know what these people are thinking. You know, it's your country two. What are you thinking? 300 Americans a week die from Mexican-trafficked heroin."
01:01:33 - 01:02:08 (35 sec),"300. Think of it, 300 a week. Tens of thousands of Americans are killed every year by heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, vast quantities of which are smuggled across our southern border. You know that. 78,000 people died and that's a number that's much, much smaller than the real number. To confront the border crisis last month I declared a national emergency on our southern border."
01:02:08 - 01:03:01 (53 sec),The radical Democrats retaliated by passing a reckless resolution to terminate vital border security operations. Can you believe this? In two weeks ago I proudly issued my first veto. And two days ago our great Republicans in the House of Representatives -- I won't get fancy with you I will just say they essentially gave us the right to build the wall and lots of money is pouring in. So we are building the wall.
01:03:01 - 01:03:34 (33 sec),We will be finishing the wall. It's moving along rapidly. We are giving out many additional contracts. We are going to be building it in many different locations simultaneously with different contractors. And sometime over the next two weeks I will be going to a certain place which I won't tell you now because they will be waiting for me. I will be going to a certain place and we are going to be showing you mast sections of brand-new beautiful walls.
01:03:34 - 01:04:02 (28 sec),"Because we are going to put the job to safety and to security of American citizens first. And you know when I campaigned it's going to be so much easier the second time. Remember this, I never did this before and I am one and one, right? We are 1 for 1. 1 for 1. [Inaudible] and it was tough. It was tough."
01:04:02 - 01:04:22 (20 sec),You know why? Because I get up on a stage and I've never debated before but I never left center stage. Right? Never left center stage meaning we were winning the whole time and I debated and I said where are these people coming from but I never did it and I never said to anybody I'm going to produce jobs.
01:04:22 - 01:04:48 (26 sec),I'm going to bring back your auto business. I'm going to do great for the vets. I'm going to do great for tax cuts. I'm going to cut regulations more than anybody in the history of our country in two years. I never said -- I couldn't say that. But I did say that I was going to do it but who the hell's going to believe me? Now I've done more than I ever promised I was going to do so the debate should be very easy.
01:04:48 - 01:05:32 (44 sec),"Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis. [Audience chants four more years] Thank you. Well, I'll give you a question, okay. So I told you before the lowest unemployment rates in the history of our country for African-American great citizens. Now I say that and it's like I say that and I just say your turn, what the hell are they going to do to beat that?"
01:05:32 - 01:06:05 (33 sec),"And we have many other things for every single citizen, everybody is benefiting. Everybody. Everybody is benefiting. So before -- so before first election, my first election. What the hell? I never did it before. I did a good job though do you think? So did you. So did you. You know the fact is we did it together and I've always said it. I didn't do it. We did it together."
01:06:05 - 01:06:48 (43 sec),"But -- but think about it now instead of saying I'm going to do this I'm going to produce 5.5 million new jobs, I'm going to bring back manufacturing 600,000 new jobs in a short period of time. Now I've done it. I mean it should be easy don't you agree? It should be easy. Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis for one simple reason because they have cause the border crisis and you know why else?"
01:06:48 - 01:07:21 (33 sec),"Honestly because they want boats and because they don't want to give us a win. They don't want to give us a win. They put that ahead of what's good for our country. The mass illegal immigration across our border is a direct consequence of Democrats supported loopholes, Democrat promises of amnesty, amnesty."
01:07:21 - 01:08:02 (41 sec),"You have people coming up here you know they are all met by the lawyers, the lawyers and they come out, they are all met by the loiterers and they say the following phrase I am very afraid for my life. I am afraid for my life. Okay. And then I look at the guy, he looks like he just got out of the ring, he's a heavyweight champion of the world, he's [Inaudible]. It's a big fat con job, folks."
01:08:02 - 01:08:41 (39 sec),"It's a big fat con job. And Democrat sanctuary cities and their refusal to protect American borders it's not the money. When I fought for them recently, they gave me so much money for everything else but nothing for the wall. Now think of it. Walls work, folks. We need the wall. They said would you call it slats?"
01:08:41 - 01:09:14 (33 sec),I said I'll call it slats. Would you call it steel barriers? I said I'll -- I said I'll call it whatever the hell you want just give me the money to build it and then they sort of got a little cold feet and now I call it the wall and I got the money anyway. So that's over. But there open border policies are truly a betrayal to the American people.
01:09:14 - 01:10:04 (49 sec),"This is dangerous what's coming into our country is dangerous. To defend the United States of America I deployed the United States military. I got thousands of troops. Right now we have about 4000 troops on our southern border and they are fantastic. And think of it, or years we defended the borders of foreign countries but we don't want to defend our own borders."
01:10:04 - 01:10:41 (38 sec),"Think of how crazy this is. We are defending borders of countries that are 6000 miles away that many of you have never even heard the name of these countries but our southern border, our border along Mexico where we have a lot of problems in drugs and human traffickers and child traffickers and all of this coming in, we don't want to defend our border."
01:10:41 - 01:11:12 (31 sec),"Think of that, how crazy that is. So now we are defending our borders for our country and the people of our country. In the last two years alone ICE officers -- we love ICE, have made listen to this though, 266,000 our risk of criminal aliens. Who the hell wants to do that? You don't want to do it, right?"
01:11:12 - 01:11:48 (35 sec),"You like what you are doing making cars, right? I like making cars I think better, too. But they like it. That's what they do. They are great at it including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,006 crimes, 4000 kidnappings and 4000 murders. Okay. We got them. They got them. How about if you don't get them?"
01:11:48 - 01:12:09 (21 sec),"How about if you leave all of those people? You know what that means for us don't you? The Democrats want to abolish ICE. They want to get rid of these very great patriots, these very tough people that love our country as much as anybody I've ever seen. They want to set violent offenders free and directly they will be coming in to your communities."
01:12:09 - 01:13:04 (55 sec),"We are not going to have it. We are not having it. We want our country to be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not for criminal aliens. Right? The Republican Party will always stand with the heroes of ICE and the heroes of Border Patrol. These are great people. Every day of my Presidency ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens and we are either throwing them behind bars or throwing them the hell out of our country."
01:13:04 - 01:13:35 (31 sec),"And we are throwing out gangs like MS 13. These are some of the sickest, most demented, most vicious people in the world. We are throwing them out of our country by the thousands. In recent months the Democrat party has also been aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion of allowing children -- to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth."
01:13:35 - 01:14:08 (33 sec),"And now we go a step further in Virginia. The Governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby, wrap the baby up, make the baby comfortable, to be executed after birth. That is why in my State of the Union address I called on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting the extreme late-term abortion of babies."
01:14:08 - 01:14:43 (35 sec),"The Democrat Party has never been further outside of the mainstream. They are being brought so far left you wouldn't like it folks. You wouldn't like it. You won't be happy. Radical Democrats are the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, hoaxes and delusions. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans."
01:14:43 - 01:15:12 (29 sec),"It's what we want to be. It's the way we want to live. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream. And every day we make good on the motto promises made, promises kept. Last week I signed in order to defend free speech on college campuses. And to keep America safe we are rebuilding America's military might making it more powerful than ever before by far."
01:15:12 - 01:15:37 (25 sec),I withdrew the United States from the horrible costly one-sided Iran nuclear deal and look what happened. Iran is a different country today than it was two and a half years ago. I recognized Israel's capital and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And just days ago I announced that the United States will recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
01:15:37 - 01:16:05 (28 sec),Very important. Very important. We also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and we strongly condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. We stand with the people of Venezuela and Cuba and Nicaragua and their righteous struggled to finally be free. We stand with them. Doing a lot of work.
01:16:05 - 01:16:46 (41 sec),"Socialism is not a good thing, you are right. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and the American rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way."
01:16:46 - 01:17:36 (49 sec),"We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, to honor our history, to be proud, to be happy, to love and always to respect our great American flag. [Audience chants USA] And we believe in the words and always will, we are not changing it, they want us to change a lot of things it's not happening of our national motto in God we trust."
01:17:36 - 01:18:25 (50 sec),"In God we trust. These are traditions, customs and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the magnificent lands of Michigan. These are the values that brought the incredible people of this incredible state to Grand Rapids for the very last rally of the 2016 campaign, probably the most exciting and hopefully the most fruitful campaign in the history of our country."
01:18:25 - 01:19:01 (36 sec),"On that historic day you rejected the failed political establishment that chipped away your jobs, sold out your sovereignty and tied us down in endless foreign wars which we are now winning and getting out. You stood up to the corrupt special interest and you stood up to the rigged Washington power structure."
01:19:01 - 01:19:53 (51 sec),"You have stood with me. You watched this rigged power structure. You were with me. I won't forget it and you will be very proud looking back that you did it. Thank you. You took back your country. You recaptured your destiny. You defended your dignity and you proudly reclaimed your freedom, maybe for a second time."
01:19:53 - 01:20:46 (53 sec),"You have always been loyal to your nation and now you have a President who is loyal to you 100 percent. The Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted but with us you will never ever be forgotten again. You will never be taken for granted ever, ever, ever. I am fighting for you and your jobs in your life in your community with everything that I have and I will never ever stop and we are winning so big."
01:20:46 - 01:22:21 (95 sec),"Nobody ever thought it could happen. We will always fight on to victory. Together we are going to make our beautiful stand. We are going to stand for justice, for safety, for sovereignty and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people and one United States of America.Because together with the very proud and very truly incredible and inspiring people of Michigan we will make America wealthy again. And we are doing it. We will make America stronger again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michigan."
00:00:00 - 00:00:28 (28 sec),"Shabbat, Shalom. Thank you. What a great day. Thank you, Norm, for that wonderful introduction and for your leadership of this truly tremendous organization. So many friends, I have so many friends out in the audience. Thank you very much for being here. [Audience cheers] Thank you. Thank you. [Audience cheers] Thank you very much."
00:00:28 - 00:02:11 (103 sec),"He's going back home to mommy and he will be reprimanded, he will be, right. She gets it. I'm truly thrilled to be back with so many friends, supporters, patriots, at the annual conference of the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is now setting records. Records. Here today is someone who has been with us from the very beginning, a true fighter for our shared values, your terrific Executive Director Matt Brooks."
00:02:11 - 00:02:43 (32 sec),"Thank you, Matt, thank you. Thank you, Matt. Also joining us are two great leaders. You know very well my good friends Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, great people. They like you both, Sheldon, it's pretty good. Last year was my honor to award Miriam The Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's a big deal. I also want to thank Senator Lindsey Graham, he's here, senator."
00:02:43 - 00:03:50 (68 sec),"Where's Lindsey? Senator Lindsey, great man, great friend, great friend of Israel. Thank you, Lindsey. A man who fights all the time for Israel and for everything else. Another great Senator David Perdue, Georgia. Senator Kevin Cramer. Where's Kevin? Kevin, Kevin, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. He fought a battle, you wouldn't believe it. He beats somebody by 11 points, that was unbeatable."
00:03:50 - 00:04:22 (31 sec),"That's pretty good, Kevin. I said, ""You can do it."" That was my only thing. I said, ""You could do it."" He won by a lot. He won by a lot, and he's a great gentleman and he's a big, big fan and supporter of Israel. As well as a really terrific leader, he's our leader, Kevin McCarthy. And we have representatives that are outstanding."
00:04:22 - 00:05:06 (45 sec),"The great Billy Long. Where's Billy? Billy? Billy Long. Denver Riggleman. Denver, thank you. Thank you, Denver. Michael Waltz. Thank you, Michael. Great job you do, Mike. And a very good friend of mine also, Lee Zeldin. And a special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota. Oh, oh, I forgot. She doesn't like Israel, I forgot, I'm so sorry, oh. No, she doesn't like Israel, does she?"
00:05:06 - 00:05:45 (39 sec),"Oh, please, I apologize. A great friend of mine, one of the most successful men in the state, amazing guy, tremendous businessman, Mr. Phil Ruffin. Where is Phil? Phil? Thank you, Phil. A competitor of mine in Manhattan for a long time, always built great buildings, great architecture, was known for design and success, loves Israel, George Klein."
00:05:45 - 00:06:11 (26 sec),"Thank you, George. Thank you, George. So many friends in Israel. We're also grateful to be joined by members of my administration, including Jason Greenblatt, and a young man named Jared Kushner. He is fighting for Israel. Thank you very much, great job. Peace in the Middle East. If they can't do it, nobody can."
00:06:11 - 00:06:35 (24 sec),"David Friedman, your ambassador to Israel. He loves Israel, so an incredible job. Thank you, David. Finally, to every member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, thank you for your incredible support and your outstanding commitment to our country, to our safety, and to electing more Republicans. We need more Republicans, let's go so we can win everything."
00:06:35 - 00:07:07 (32 sec),"Over the next 19 months, I know that the Republican Jewish Coalition will help lead our party to another historic victory. And by the way, we did very well at 18, you can ask David and Lindsey, we won the Senate. We took on two more. There were three or four that were very close, that weren't supposed to be. All of a sudden that didn't happen and we're going to talk about that, I think, when we get back to Washington."
00:07:07 - 00:07:29 (22 sec),"But I'll tell you what, we picked up two Senate seats and now it's 53 to 47. And we have 53 great senators, and when it comes to appointments, when it comes to the United States Supreme Court, when it comes To approving all of the judges way over a hundred judges, federal judges, you need the Senate, we did well."
00:07:29 - 00:07:58 (29 sec),"They don't like to talk about that. They don't like. And I don't have enough time so many people in the house, but the people I went for, like in Kentucky, Matt Barr, he's -- he won. He was down and he won. We won so much. We won in Georgia, great Governor Brian Kemp. They had President Obama, they had Oprah, they had Michelle Obama."
00:07:58 - 00:08:17 (20 sec),"They were going for their new star, their new star of the party, and I was going for Brian. All he had was Trump. You know what, Brian won. Brian won. And the governor of a great state, known as Ohio, you have a great governor. He was not expected to win. He campaigned brilliantly. We did some incredible rallies."
00:08:17 - 00:08:55 (37 sec),"He won by almost seven points, he won easily. So Mike is great. And the governor of Florida. Governor of Florida. That was supposed to be a close race and was a tough race, but we won that one and Oklahoma, and many other places, we did so well. We get no credit, fake news, we get no credit. We get no credit, let's just keep winning."
00:08:55 - 00:09:26 (32 sec),"I'd rather have it that way they get too much credit and not win, that happens true to some people, doesn't happen to me. When I spoke to you as a candidate three years ago, America's economy was stagnant. Our military was depleted and the relationship between the United States and Israel was at probably the lowest point in history."
00:09:26 - 00:09:53 (26 sec),"How the hell did you support President Obama? How did you do? How did you do it? How do you support the Democrats with you guys [Inaudible]. I think, probably most of the people in this room that, ah, you love Israel, but you know, you look at the Iran deal. You look at so much that was done so negatively."
00:09:53 - 00:10:28 (35 sec),"Now, just three years later, I stand before you as the president of the United States to report on a very different situation under Republican leadership. America's economy is the hottest anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. Our military will soon be more powerful than ever before, $700 billion, $716 billion this year."
00:10:28 - 00:10:57 (29 sec),"I don't know, David and Lindsey, I think, probably in the 750 to 725 range, have to do it. You don't have the military. You owe the stuff, doesn't matter, does it, huh? You don't have to worry about inflation. You don't have to worry about anything. You got to have a strong, strong military. We'll have the strongest that we've ever had before."
00:10:57 - 00:11:26 (29 sec),"And the incredible bond between the United States and Israel has never been stronger than it is right now. America's thriving, America's booming, and America is winning, winning, winning like never before. We're respected again, we are respected again. It's been a long time. Since the election, we've created more than 5.5 million new jobs, including 600,000 manufacturing jobs."
00:11:26 - 00:12:14 (48 sec),"Things that nobody would have allowed me to say on the campaign trail. They would have said, ""Oh, he exaggerates."" After years of stagnation, wages are rising fast. Think of it, people had one job 21 years ago. They made more money in real dollars than they did two years ago, with three jobs, and two jobs, and now, for the first time, they have a choice, our economy so strong."
00:12:14 - 00:12:35 (21 sec),"They can have a choice of jobs and wages are going up, first time in many, many years. And one of the things that makes me happiest, frankly, is that they're going up most quickly for the lowest income Americans. Great. Great? Great. Our unemployment has reached the lowest level in more than 50 years and we will be breaking that record, I believe, pretty soon."
00:12:35 - 00:13:02 (26 sec),"We slashed 30,000 pages of job killing regulations from the federal register, an all time record. It doesn't matter if they were there for four years or eight years or 10 years, in one instance. We really did something. We had -- take a look at FDR, all of those years, all of those years. Nobody slashed them like as yet a fourth-termer."
00:13:02 - 00:13:36 (35 sec),"You have a lot of two-termers and in less than two years -- and I happen to believe that that was as important and maybe even more important than the largest tax cut in the history of our country. Thank you also. We're fixing broken trade deals, we're working on a trade deal now with China, we're doing very well, very well because of tariffs."
00:13:36 - 00:14:10 (34 sec),"We're making a deal that's very good, you'll, be happy if it happens, might not happen, but we have tremendous power. We have to tell our people that represent us in Washington that when countries -- I'm not talking about China, I'm talking about many countries. When they're charging us 100% tax or tariff."
00:14:10 - 00:15:09 (59 sec),"When they're charging us 200 and 250 and 300%, and we charge them nothing, it's OK to charge them something. Maybe you could explain that to some of your people that say, ""Oh, we don't like tariffs."" I mean, we have a case where a certain country, India, is charging us. We're a great country, a great friend, Prime Minister Modi charging us over a 100% for many things."
00:15:09 - 00:15:52 (43 sec),"We're charging them nothing for similar or the same product, and I have senators that say you can't do that. It's not free trade. Where do they come from? Where do they come from? It's not free trade. I don't know. Where's David? You got to work on this pretty well, David. You -- Where's Lindsey? He used to work on that."
00:15:52 - 00:16:32 (40 sec),"It's the craziest thing. Its stupid trade. We have so much stupid trade. We lost, for many years now, $800 billion a year on trade. Who the hell makes these deals? You're, probably saying yourself. Those are not good negotiators. Actually, Democrats made a lot of money, but Republicans met a lot of them too."
00:16:32 - 00:17:02 (29 sec),"That's amazing thing, they made a lot, 800 billion, but we're getting it back, we're getting it back. We're going to be getting a lot of it. One thing, if they let me really do my thing, we'd get it back, but I have to be a little bit politically correct by saying, ""It's OK if we lose 20 billion with a country."" You know, because we want to be nice, wouldn't it be nice to everybody."
00:17:02 - 00:17:27 (25 sec),"We're cracking down on countries that cheat. We're replacing NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA. NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made. You know, many of you, people have factories and plants, they're still empty. They signed NAFTA, and it was that great, big, sucking sound."
00:17:27 - 00:18:13 (46 sec),"Remember that? Remember that? Ross Perot, a great big, sucking sound, it's what happened. They left, they went to Mexico, they went to Canada, they went to a lot of places. It was a bad thing for us, but we'll be ending NAFTA, hopefully very soon, very soon. And one of the things in the new deal is that it's very difficult financially for a company to leave the United States, fire all of its employees, move, let's say, to Mexico or Canada, open up a new plant, make a product, sell it in for no tax, so we end up with unemployment and nothing but loss and empty factories."
00:18:13 - 00:18:48 (35 sec),"That's not happening anymore, folks, not happening. We've ended the war on American energy and the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, bigger than Russia and bigger than Saudi Arabia, can you believe that? Can you believe that? Three years. Thank you very much."
00:18:48 - 00:19:27 (40 sec),"And we're working now on getting pipelines approved in Texas that would normally take 10, 12, 14, 15 years to get approved, and we're trying to get him approve very rapidly. And if we do that, we're going to pick up another 20 to 25%, we'll be leading by so much. We already are leading by a lot. So it all happened over a very short period of time and we've confirmed more than 100 new federal judges to interpret the Constitution as [Inaudible] And as Norm said, and I appreciate that, so important, Norm."
00:19:27 - 00:20:07 (40 sec),"We have confirmed two incredible Supreme Court justices, Neil Gossage and Brett Kavanaugh. Don't let the Democrats take it away from us, they'll take it all away, they'll take it all away, including the judges. With the help of Republicans in Congress, we have secured record funding for our military. Our military is now going to be stronger than ever before."
00:20:07 - 00:20:38 (31 sec),"Ever. Not even close we're developing new weapons systems, we're developing things that nobody even thought of. Levels of technology that nobody else has with all of that being said, if we can be smart, and if China and Russia, and maybe one or two others, if necessary, can be smart, we'd all be saving a tremendous amount of money, and that's OK with me, but we will be so far in the lead."
00:20:38 - 00:21:06 (28 sec),"We always have to be in the lead and thanks to our focus on burden sharing, $100 billion, more dollars, will be coming this year to NATO, think of that. Other countries, in certain instances, were getting an almost free ride. We protect them and they're delinquent. You know, I used a real estate term for George Klein."
00:21:06 - 00:21:30 (24 sec),"He understands it. He understands. We were delinquent. They were delinquent. I said, ""You got to pay."" President Obama got -- made a nice speech, but he forgot to mention you got to pay. President Bush was wonderful, they didn't mention, you got to pay and you got to meet it, not just mentioned you got to mean it. I said you got to pay, because we're in a position."
00:21:30 - 00:22:19 (48 sec),"Everybody wants us, but how do you do that when people aren't paying? How do you do that? We feel foolish. We feel like fools. We're not going to be fools anymore. We've been a fool as a nation for so long, we're not going to be fools anymore. Last year I withdrew the United States from one of the most dangerous one-sided deals ever negotiated the disastrous Iran nuclear deal."
00:22:19 - 00:22:44 (26 sec),"They wanted to kill Israel, they wanted to destroy Israel. And maybe you could explain to the young man that just got taken out what it means when a country shouts as they're signing the deal Death to Israel. Maybe you could explain that to him. We've now imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian dictatorship, and it is not the same country it was when I took power."
00:22:44 - 00:23:10 (26 sec),"When I took over the presidency, I will tell you, one of the first meetings I had was at the Pentagon. Great generals, great people. I wanted a briefing on Iran with 14 different sites, they're all very, very dangerous, blow ups, all over. They were either behind it, hey had mercenaries, they had money or they had their own soldiers there all over the Middle East."
00:23:10 - 00:23:37 (27 sec),"It's a whole different story today, folks. They have riots in the streets. They have very little money coming in. A lot of things have changed. North Korea, we're getting along with North Korea. Let's see how it works out, but we have a good relationship. Don't forget, I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un. When I first came in, they were setting rockets and nuclear explosions and a lot of things were happening."
00:23:37 - 00:23:55 (18 sec),"I can't tell you what's going to happen, how to walk from the one deal. Was it going to be a right deal, but -- but we have a great relationship, we'll see what happens, I hope we're going to be able to do something. Maybe, maybe not, but I hope we're going to be able -- Relationship is very important, you know that very well."
00:23:55 - 00:24:30 (35 sec),"We're confronting the deadly menace of radical Islamic terrorism. When I took office, just over two years ago, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. I held up a map, it was so much red. Red, meaning, them. All red, showing the different sites. Today, the ISIS caliphate has been 100% obliterated."
00:24:30 - 00:25:03 (33 sec),"100%. And my previous generals said, ""That it was going to take, sir, it will take two years."" I flew to Iraq. I met a different group of generals, ""Sir, we can do it in one week."" I said, ""You could take a little longer than that."" They did it in a few weeks. They were -- They are great, right? Raisin Cain."
00:25:03 - 00:25:26 (23 sec),"He's name is Raisin. ""What's your first name?"" ""Raisin."" ""Raisin? What the hell kind of -- What's your last name?"", ""Cain."" ""Wait a minute,your name is Raising Cain? I like you as a general."" I think -- that it's what I want. Even Sheldon Adelson likes that decision. The kind of guy he'd have. I also took another historic action that had been decades in waiting."
00:25:26 - 00:26:11 (44 sec),"The United States recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Because, unlike other presidents, I keep my promises. Every president, for many decades, said they were going to do that, and I understand really why. Because when it was determined that maybe I'd do it, maybe there was a chance."
00:26:11 - 00:26:47 (36 sec),"The calls I got from leaders of other countries were unbelievable. Presidents, dictators, prime minister, kings, queens, everybody, my phone was ringing off the hook. So I knew I was going to do it, so I left a message. I said, ""I'm going to call you next week."" They said, ""Could we speak to him soon?"". ""No, no. No, he's not available."" They'll call it lying."
00:26:47 - 00:27:11 (25 sec),"The fake news will say, ""That's a horrible lie."" I want to be nice. ""No, no I'll call you next week. I look forward to it."" I had so many calls after this. It took me like three weeks to make all the calls, but I knew what they were calling about. So I did it. I did it. Then I started calling people back."
00:27:11 - 00:27:43 (31 sec),"King, how are you, how have you been? ""I called you last week."" ""So what's up?"" ""Well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel and the embassy in Jerusalem."" I said, ""Look, I'm sorry, wish I would've known. I did it, I did it yesterday."" Right, it's much easier, but I now know why other president -- I don't really hold it against him other than they didn't keep their promise, right?"
00:27:43 - 00:28:15 (33 sec),"They didn't keep their promise, David. So that's the way it is, and we got you something that you wanted. I can tell you, Sheldon and Miriam, that is the most important thing, I think, that's ever happened in their life. They love Israel. So, I can now understand, because I always said, ""Why wouldn't they do it, why?"
00:28:15 - 00:28:48 (32 sec),"Why are they doing it? Why wouldn't they just do it?"" They campaign, ""We will do this and that -- Israel, Israel."" Then you folks go out and vote for them and then they don't do it, right? Four years, eight years, didn't matter, they won't do it, but you know what, they did it. We did a great job and we feel great about it. And then last week, Israel security, really so important."
00:28:48 - 00:29:20 (32 sec),"It's all about security, when you get right down, it's about security, so is No. 1 for me. I got to talk. We can talk healthcare we could talk a hundred different things without security. What does it matter? I stood with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyahu. How is the race going by the way? How is it? Who is going to win the race?"
00:29:20 - 00:29:44 (25 sec),"Tell me, I don't know. Well, it's gonna be close. I think it's gonna be close. Two good people, two good people. But I stood with the prime minister at the White House to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights is something I've been hearing about for a long time, the Golan Heights."
00:29:44 - 00:30:11 (26 sec),"So, I just talked to your Ambassador Friedman and not about this, they've been trying to get that approved, as you know, for 52 years they wanted recognition from the United States of the Golan Heights. They had 32 summits, meetings, big meetings over many, many decades about the Golan Heights. I'm talking to your ambassador."
00:30:11 - 00:30:43 (33 sec),"Gerard was there, Jason Greenblatt was there. I said, ""Fellas, do me a favor, give me a little -- a little history, quick, wanna go fast."" I got a lot of things I'm working on, China, North Korea. Give me a quickie. Norm, I said, ""Give me a quick little slice -- so I know it as well as Norm, but I don't want to spend quite as much time as he has spent studying it, but -- which has been his entire life, right?"
00:30:43 - 00:31:05 (22 sec),"So that 32 different summits, he starts going well. We need that as a high point, we need it for protection we need it for -- I said, I could -- How do you like the idea? They weren't even calling about this. How do you like the idea of me recognizing exactly what we're discussing? Because I agree, you need it. You need to hide, you need to hide."
00:31:05 - 00:31:41 (36 sec),"The great generals said, ""Always fight downhill. Never fight, uphill."" Battles are lost, for these generals want to fight uphill, right? You need to hide. So I said, ""David, what do you think about me recognizing Israel and the Golan Heights?"" He said, ""Would you actually do?"" It is a great deal because one of the most successful lines was gave it all up. In order to be your ambassador gave it all up. ""What do you think of it David?"" And he goes -- and this is a very strong, ambitious guy."
00:31:41 - 00:32:19 (38 sec),"He like it like a wonderful, beautiful baby, he said, ""Do you really -- You would do that, sir?"" I see -- I think, I'm doing it right now. Let's write something out. We make fast decisions and we make good decisions. Look, I made -- I made a lot of good decisions, I make good decisions and we get something beautiful talking about security."
00:32:19 - 00:33:04 (44 sec),"Talking about the greatness of Israel and I went, ""Bing, it was done."" Then I watched well look at all those cameras. Then I watched the fake news and they said, ""We have breaking news. President Trump has just committed to the Golan Heights."" And it was a big big story for two days. Everyone's happy, no repercussions and there won't be. I went there to protect Israel, so there won't be. We did the right thing, we did the right thing."
00:33:04 - 00:33:21 (18 sec),"And I want to congratulate Jared, and Jason Greenblatt, and david Friedman and all of the people they work with. And a big thing for me, and some of you won't like this maybe, but I would love to see peace in the Middle East, I would love to see peace in the Middle East. And if those three can't do it, you'll never have it done."
00:33:21 - 00:33:50 (28 sec),"It's never -- with me as president, with them doing the deal, you'll never have it done, so let's see if we can do it, who knows. Under my administration, the United States will always support Israel's right to self-defense. At the United Nations we no longer tolerate any form of anti-American, anti Israel, and anti-Semitic bias."
00:33:50 - 00:34:22 (32 sec),"We don't do it. For example, the United Nations Human Rights Council has repeatedly denigrated America and Israel. Why -- and you know this you've heard this while ignoring the world's worst human-rights abusers. That's why I withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights Council, and thank you to Nikki."
00:34:22 - 00:35:21 (60 sec),"Thank you to Nikki. Terrific job, Nikki Haley. With your help, we are making incredible strides on behalf of the American people and we are just getting started. [Audience cheers] Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And that guy that just said that, he used to hate me. Can you believe that? He used to hate me. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. But while Republicans fight to protect the jobs and safety of all Americans, Democrats are advancing the most extreme partisan agenda by far in American history."
00:35:21 - 00:36:10 (48 sec),"You see what's happening. You see what's happening. People aren't fighting for Israel in Congress, large numbers of people. You saw what took place three weeks ago. It was shocking that couldn't have happened. It could not have happened just a few years ago, could not have happened. If implemented, the Democrats radical agenda would destroy our economy, cripple our country, and very well could leave Israel out there all by yourselves, can't do that more than 100 Democrats in Congress are promoting the biggest government power grab in U.S history."
00:36:10 - 00:36:56 (46 sec),"The $100 trillion Green New Deal, proposed by a wonderful young bartender, 29 years old, 29. No, I like her, she's 29 years old. We take trains to Europe, Hawaii and Australia. That's a problem. The farming business is in big trouble, right. The auto business you get one car, somehow Detroit etc., you know bring in so many car companies in. I don't think they're going to be thrilled to hear that."
00:36:56 - 00:37:14 (18 sec),"We are -- we're built -- I tell you what, when you look at what's happening with the car companies, they're opening up in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and South Carolina, it's amazing, what's happening, we want to keep it going. You know, they could destroy what we've built very quickly."
00:37:14 - 00:37:43 (29 sec),"It does it -- that's why having Lindsey and David and all of the people that I mentioned, and so many more back in Washington really want to stop it, and we've got to win the election, we're going to win it, we're going to win a big. It will never be as easy as it looks. Over 120 congressional Democrats are also supporting a socialist takeover of our healthcare system that would take away private insurance."
00:37:43 - 00:38:11 (28 sec),"If you take a look at this, 180 million people will lose their private health insurance. And you're finally happy, you're happy. We've done a lot of work on that, you're happy. The radical Democrats are also pushing for a thing called -- If you can believe this, open borders. They want open borders, they want people to pour into our country."
00:38:11 - 00:38:42 (31 sec),"Last month, more than 100,000 illegal migrants were apprehended at our border. Apprehended. Think of this, hundreds of thousands of people. And we're on pace to apprehend more than a million illegal migrants this year, a million they're coming up because of the economy they're coming up because our laws are so bad from the Democrats."
00:38:42 - 00:39:09 (27 sec),"Catch and release you catch 'em and you release 'em. Oh, that's wonderful. If they put one foot on our territory, if they start climbing a fence and they're on the Mexico side. Welcome to the United States, think of it. It's the craziest thing. They have a visa lottery. Democrats, a visa lottery, a lottery, countries, a lottery."
00:39:09 - 00:39:53 (43 sec),"You pick out a name. Do you think they're putting their finest? Do you think they're putting their great people there? No and then people come in and you see what happens with the crime and murders, 4,000 murders last year, four thousand. How stupid can we be to put up with this? How stupid can we be? And the asylum program is a scam, some of the roughest people you've ever seen, people that looked like they should be fighting for the UFC."
00:39:53 - 00:40:23 (30 sec),"They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place, you know, my lawyers, they tell them what to say. You look at this guy, you say, ""Wow, that's a tough cookie."" I am very fearful for my life. I am very worried that I will be accosted if I was sent back home. No, no he'll do the acoustic."
00:40:23 - 00:40:59 (36 sec),"Asylum. Oh, give him asylum, he's afraid, he's afraid. We don't love the fact that he's got tattoos on his face, that's not a good sign. We don't love the fact that he's carrying the flag of Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador only to say he's petrified to be in his country. To confront this border crisis, I declared a national emergency."
00:40:59 - 00:41:29 (30 sec),"And David Perdue and Lindsey Graham helped me, a lot of people helped us. When congressional Democrats tried to reverse my order and terminate vital border security operations, I very proudly issued my first veto and they were not able to turn over the veto. So now we have -- in fact we have billions of dollars."
00:41:29 - 00:41:52 (24 sec),"We've started building walls -- actually, a while ago, from the first 1.6 billion and renovation of a lot of walls, we can do that a lot cheaper. We had walls that were potentially very good, but they were in very bad shape, they were old, we renovated it. We have got a tremendous amount, we're going to put out list, but we will have hundreds of miles before the end of next year."
00:41:52 - 00:42:29 (37 sec),"Hundreds of miles. And yesterday I traveled to the border in Calexico, California, and I saw a section of brand new 30 foot high steel wall, you want to be able to see through it. Got to see through it, got to see who's on the other side, beautiful wall, looks great, looks great. Walls build good neighbors, right."
00:42:29 - 00:42:48 (19 sec),"Now we we have to take care of ourselves and I have to say I said I was going to close the border. It's gotten so bad. I said we're closing the border and as soon as I said that, and I really thank the president of Mexico because they stepped up and now they are apprehending people on their southern border."
00:42:48 - 00:43:27 (39 sec),"Coming in from Honduras, El Salvador, and various other places,Guatemala and I stopped paying almost $600 million to those three countries. Now I got a lot of heat. The Democrats say, ""How dare you do that?"" That money is used for all these good, but no it's not it's largely stolen. I sent 600 million, we do, 600 million to three countries and they form caravans."
00:43:27 - 00:44:00 (33 sec),"Now, if the government wanted to, I have a feeling they'd be able to stop caravans from forming in those three countries. I have a feeling they're, pretty tough they're, pretty tough ad, but they did say, stop the payment. Do you mind? Are you okay with it? Because I've taken -- I've taken a lot of heat from the stupid people that say, ""Oh gee, we should keep..."" We have people that work with them that say we should be sending much more money."
00:44:00 - 00:44:22 (22 sec),"We should be building things they're, helping them. What about building our own country for a change? Wouldn't that be nice? Unfortunately, Democrats have refused to close immigration loopholes, that's really what it's all about. And again, Mexico is apprehended 14,000 people yesterday, a thousand people today, before they've never done this."
00:44:22 - 00:44:45 (23 sec),"Never to the extent, and I appreciate it, I appreciate it, but if they don't do it, I'm going to close the border or I'm going to do tariffs or the cars made in Mexico. They took 30% of our car business, by the way, I wasn't here when that happened, OK. I used to complain about it as a civilian. I complain, I said, ""What the hell is going on? They're taking our business."" They have 30% of our cars."
00:44:45 - 00:45:14 (30 sec),"They make 30% of our cars, they send them into our country, no tax, no nothing, essentially, and we lost a lot of jobs, but we're getting them all back now, we're getting more back. But I said we're either going to tariff those cars coming in at 25%, which is a tremendous amount of money. It's all about the cars, the cars are a big deal or we're going to close the border, and I will say this, Mexico has been great."
00:45:14 - 00:45:35 (21 sec),"The last four or five days, they've been great, first time first time. At the heart of, and I don't mind, closing the border. I'd say, you know, a lot of these fakers back there they say, ""He will never close the border."" It's too much. Well, you know, close the border. We stop about $500 billion worth of drugs from pouring into our country."
00:45:35 - 00:46:16 (41 sec),"You know, there are a lot of advantages too, a lot of advantages. I'm OK with it. I don't want to do it, but I'm OK with it, I'll do it. I'll do whatever is necessary to stop an invasion of our country. That's what it is. At the heart of the crisis are the 9th Circuit rulings in the Flores case and the Trafficking Victims, Protection Reauthorization Act, driving a staggering surge of illegal families and minors into the hands of our incredible border patrol people."
00:46:16 - 00:46:41 (25 sec),"They've done an incredible job. What they do is incredible, I was with them yesterday. So Congress must end catch-and-release so that illegal border crossers can be quickly and safely returned to their home. Get out. Sorry, get out, sorry, can't handle it. And I told my people yesterday, our country's full, we're full."
00:46:41 - 00:47:17 (35 sec),"Our systems full, our country is full, can't come in, our country is full. What can you do? We can't handle anymore? Our country is full, can't come in, I'm sorry, it's very simple. Never before has a major political party been more outside the American mainstream than the Democrats of today. They have become the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, witch hunts, and delusions."
00:47:17 - 00:47:45 (28 sec),"And now the Democrats have even allowed the terrible scorch of anti-Semitism to Take root in their party and in their country, they have allowed that, they have allowed that. House Democrats recently blocked legislation to confront the anti-Semitic movement to boycott and sanction Israel. Nobody could believe it, right."
00:47:45 - 00:48:15 (30 sec),"Nobody. You couldn't believe it. Republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism. We do, all of us. Earlier this year, I appointed a new special envoy to monitor and combat Anti-Semitism. We are grateful that he has joined us today, Elan Carr. Where is Elan? Thank you, great job, Elan."
00:48:15 - 00:48:47 (32 sec),"Elan is as good as I hear, he's going to do a great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Congratulations. At my State of the Union address. I was honored to have as our guest a Pittsburgh SWAT officer, brave guy. I was with him in the hospital who raced into gunfire during the horrific anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue."
00:48:47 - 00:49:48 (61 sec),"He was shot seven times badly injured. He endured 12 surgeries and he's gonna have to endure quite a few more. We are proud to have him here with us right now. If he wasn't there as bad as it was, as horrible as it was, it would have been much worse. He is a brave man, Timothy Mattson. Please stand, Timothy."
00:49:48 - 00:50:14 (26 sec),"Timothy. I saw him right after this horrible event, this horrible happening, and he was laying in the hospital he had bullet wounds all over, he's a massive guy. I looked at the chest, I mean, he's got like this and it's muscle. Thank God, you're massive and thank God, you had a lot of muscle because very few people got to take it when you took Timothy, and your friends had such respect for him."
00:50:14 - 00:50:44 (29 sec),"His fellow officers they had such respect. Thank you. Glad to see you better. That's great. Glad to see you better. Amazing what he what he went through. Today we also honor two more American heroes, Mordechai Lichtenstein and [Inaudible], I love that name. Both from Brooklyn. I know Brooklyn very well, my father Fred Trump, I loved my father."
00:50:44 - 00:51:14 (30 sec),"Brooklyn. Spent a lot of time in Brooklyn. You learn a lot in Brooklyn. You get through Brooklyn, you got to be smart. Two years ago, Mordechai and [Inaudible] traveled to Jerusalem, where they prayed at the Western Wall. Soon after they left the holy site, they saw a terrorist stabbing an innocent Israeli police officer, racing to the scene."
00:51:14 - 00:51:57 (43 sec),"Mordechai pull the attacker off the soldier and was about to be stabbed himself. It was happening when the badly wounded officer summoned the little strength that he had left and shot and killed this very violent terrorist. [Inaudible]] immediately took his prayer shot and wrapped it around the officer's wounds to stop the bleeding, which was profuse after the attack, the officer said of the two Jewish Americans."
00:51:57 - 00:52:41 (45 sec),"They were sent by God to save my life. For me, my family and the Druze people of Israel. I thank God from the bottom of my heart. That's the officer, thank you, Mordechai, [Inaudible], where are you? Stand up. Great job, thank you. Great job, great job. Thank you very much. Recently, Mordechai and [Inaudible] became the first non-Israeli citizens to receive the country's civil, exemplary declaration."
00:52:41 - 00:53:17 (36 sec),"That's a big deal. To Mordechai and [Inaudible] you are an inspiration to all of us to everyone in this room to everyone in our country. Thank you very much. The three American heroes we recognize today are a powerful reminder of the timeless values that bind us together. As one nation, and that forge deep and lasting friendship with the people of Israel, we honor our history."
00:53:17 - 00:54:22 (65 sec),"We treasure our traditions, we cherish life, we love our families, we defend our sovereignty, we fight for our freedom and we place our trust in the hands of Almighty God. These are values that unite us all as Republicans as citizens, as patriots, and as proud Americans. Every day of my presidency, we fight on behalf of hardworking citizens who pay their taxes, follow our laws, raise their children, protect our communities and make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of earth."
00:54:22 - 00:55:08 (45 sec),"This government is their government, and this land is home. These American patriots have always been loyal to our country, and we will forever be loyal we swear to them. The choice for our country's future has never been clearer than it is today. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans. It will be the party for great healthcare, you watch."
00:55:08 - 00:55:44 (36 sec),"We are the party of the American worker, we are the party of the American family and we are the party of the American dream. Alongside our friends at the Republican Jewish Coalition, we will keep on working. We will keep on fighting and we will be winning, winning, winning for the American people. With your help on November 3, 2020. Can you believe?"
00:55:44 - 00:56:19 (35 sec),"It's right around the corner. Think of it. Right around the corner. [Crowd cheering.] Thank you very much. We're going to win. By the way. One of the people, and then that was confirmed by somebody else today on the other side Democrats were saying that they would reinstate -- just reinstate the Iran nuclear deal."
00:56:19 - 00:56:51 (32 sec),"Well, this is what you have. They want to reinstate the deal. It was a disaster for our country. We gave $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. What does that look like? Airplanes loaded up with cash, how stupid was that deal, they want to reinstate it. Republicans are going to win the White House, we're going to retake the House."
00:56:51 - 00:57:20 (29 sec),"We're going to keep the Senate and we are once again going to be in a position, in my opinion, like never ever before, stronger than we've ever been before. There is more spirit for the Republican Party right now than I've ever seen. They keep talking about the spirit of the Democrat Party, there's more spirit for Republicans."
00:57:20 - 00:58:08 (48 sec),"In my opinion, by far, we may express it somewhat differently and that's OK, more spirit than I have ever seen, and I've now been doing this for a little while, not too long. I'm one for one, that's one for one. I want to be two for two and then relax. Together with the love, the prayers, and devotion of everyone in this room, incredible people and the millions of patriots across our land, we will make America great again for all Americans greater than ever before."
00:58:08 - 00:58:13 (5 sec),"Thank you, and God bless you all. God bless America. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:25 (25 sec),"Well, you better love me; I kept this place open, that I can tell you. They said, ""We're closing it."" And I said, ""No, we're not."" And now you're doing record business. The job you do is incredible. And I'm thrilled to be here in Ohio with the hardworking men and women of Lima."
00:00:25 - 00:00:43 (18 sec),And this is some tank plant. There's nothing like it in the world. You make the finest equipment in the world. You really know what you're doing. They just gave me a little briefing on a couple of those tanks. I want to get into them but then I remember when a man named Dukakis got into a tank.
00:00:43 - 00:00:59 (17 sec),"[Laughter] And I remember him; he tanked when he got into the tank. [Laughter] He tanked -- I never saw anybody tank like that. So I said, maybe I'll -- but I'm a little bigger than him; I think it probably would work out okay. How would I look in a tank? Okay? Yeah, not bad. Not bad."
00:00:59 - 00:01:26 (27 sec),"The helmet was bigger than he was. That was not good. [Laughter] We're here today to celebrate a resounding victory for all of you, for northwest Ohio, and for our great military, and for our entire country. Incredible victory. After so many years of budget cuts and layoffs, today, jobs are coming back and pouring back, frankly, like never before."
00:01:26 - 00:01:59 (33 sec),"Companies are coming back into our country; they want the action. Production is ramping up in the biggest way. And the awesome M1 Abrams tank is once again thundering down the assembly line. A-1. I want to thank Acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan. He's done an incredible job. In fact, ISIS -- let me tell you about ISIS."
00:01:59 - 00:02:01 (2 sec),They're not doing so well.
00:02:01 - 00:02:20 (19 sec),"You know, we took over the caliphate. You'll see it tonight. When I came in, it was a mess. Where the hell is that chart? [Laughter] Folks, they gave me all economic charts. They didn't give me the ISIS chart. But if you did -- bring it up if anybody has it. Bring it up. When I took over, it was a mess. They were all over the place."
00:02:20 - 00:02:42 (21 sec),"All over the -- all over Syria and Iraq. And you'd see it was a sea of red. And now you look at it and there's no red. No red. And you look at some of the economic numbers; nobody thought we'd ever see numbers like that in our country -- not a for a long time, not for ever. And what we're doing has been incredible."
00:02:42 - 00:03:07 (25 sec),"What you're doing has been more incredible. You stuck it out and now you've got one of the most successful military plants anywhere in the world. It's great. So thank you very much, Pat Shanahan. Also thank you to the Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper. He's been fantastic. Thank you. Oh, good."
00:03:07 - 00:03:23 (17 sec),"Better late than never. [Laughter] Here's the story: So, you know, I donât want to have them make a big chart because it costs too much. You know, I'm a business guy. They said, ""Sir, we could make a big chart."" I said, ""How much does it cost?"" Like it matters. But it matters to me. Does that make sense to you?"
00:03:23 - 00:03:23 (0 sec),[Audience calls out Yeah]
00:03:23 - 00:04:03 (40 sec),"So, two maps, identical -- except the one on top was Syria. See that? The one on top was Syria in November of '16. You remember that date? November of '16. November 8th. We had a little victory that night. We had a little victory. But a lot of us werenât surprised by it, but the other side said, ""Where did all of those people come from?"" [Laughter] And I said, ""They just didn't like candidates for a lot of years."
00:04:03 - 00:04:28 (25 sec),"They didnât vote."" So what happens is -- this is all ISIS. Now, on the bottom -- that's as of today -- this is ISIS. There's none. The caliphate is gone, as of tonight. Pretty good. Thatâs pretty good, right? We took over a mess. We took over a mess with North Korea. We took over a mess in the Middle East."
00:04:28 - 00:04:46 (18 sec),"We took over. A lot of bad things were happening and the economy was not doing well. It was heading in the wrong direction. You remember that. It was going to go bad, and then we opened up with the regulation cuts and all of the other things we've done, including the big tax cut. But it made a big difference."
00:04:46 - 00:05:10 (24 sec),"Made a big difference. And we'll show you some numbers in a little while. I want to also thank Major General Brian Cummings for the incredible leadership and service you have done. An unbelievable job. Thank you, Brian. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're also honored to be joined by several of the Ohio leaders, friends of mine -- terrific people: Senator Rob Portman."
00:05:10 - 00:05:46 (36 sec),"Rob, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Rob. A man who I will never, I promise, wrestle. He was one of the best wrestlers in the history of college wrestling. His record is so ridiculously good. I said, ""Were you as good as Dan Gable?"" He said, ""No."" See, if it were me, I wouldâve said, ""Yes, I was much better."" [Laughter] You know who Dan Gable is. Jim Jordan, a great guy."
00:05:46 - 00:06:11 (25 sec),"And a great champion. A great, great athlete. Great champion. Thank you. He is tough. You'll want to have him on your side. Another one you want on your side always is Mike Turner. Mike, thank you. Thank you, Mike. Great. Warren Davidson. Warren, thank you. And, Bob Latta, thank you very much."
00:06:11 - 00:06:45 (34 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Warren and Bob. And a man who we're very proud of because, along with Mike, he ran a great race: Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted. He ran a great race for Governor. We came in that final day -- they were a little bit down, against a tough opponent, who I was not a big fan of, and I didnât like the people that were supporting him too much -- Pocahontas and others."
00:06:45 - 00:07:01 (16 sec),"[Laughter] And I came that final day, and we had a day that was incredible and they won by -- what did you win by? Six or seven points, right? It was an incredible -- huh? Even higher. Thatâs pretty good. Good. I'll see Mike in a little while. Thatâs great. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Proud of you."
00:07:01 - 00:07:29 (28 sec),"To our plant leaders, Lieutenant Colonel Travis Adkins and Henry Kennedy -- we appreciate everything you do to keep the Army âRolling Alongâ full speed ahead. Incredible job. We're grateful to General Dynamics -- incredible company -- Phebe Novakovic. How did I do with that one?"
00:07:29 - 00:08:01 (32 sec),"Novak-ovic. It's a little tricky, but thatâs okay. What a job you do. Thank you. Great job. Thank you for the tour, too. And the hardworking members of the United Auto Workers. Now, you've got to get over to a place that I like a lot, Lordstown. And you've got to get that. You know, the only place -- General -- what's going on with General Motors?"
00:08:01 - 00:08:20 (19 sec),We have the best economy we've ever had. We have the lowest employment -- unemployment that we've had in 51 years; soon will be the record of all time. And what's going on with General Motors? Get that plant open or sell it to somebody and theyâll open it. Everybody wants it. Sell it to somebody or open it yourselves.
00:08:20 - 00:08:43 (23 sec),"Get it going now and the UAW will help you. The UAW -- you're going to help. The UAW just promised they're going to help. Get it open now. Don't wait. They said they have discussions coming up in September, October. I said, why not tomorrow? Why not on Monday? What do you have to wait months for?"
00:08:43 - 00:09:05 (22 sec),"Get the discussions going. Get it open. Lordstown is a great area. I guess I like it because I won so big there. [Laughter] But we're doing a job, and this state has been -- we're very proud of what's happened in Ohio under our federal auspices. We've gotten so many things done, and this plant is one of our great achievements."
00:09:05 - 00:09:47 (42 sec),"To all of our active-duty service members and our wonderful veterans, thank you for serving your country -- with such tremendous distinction and honor. And to every welder, and machinist, and assembler, and mechanic, and engineer, and electrician, and carpenter, and every patriot here at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center: Thank you for pouring out your heart and your sweat and your soul to help restore the might of the American military, which very soon will be stronger than it ever was."
00:09:47 - 00:10:16 (29 sec),"We've bought billions and billions of dollars' worth of new planes and tanks and many other things. So, thank you all. Great job. And the fact is we have the best tanks driven by the best soldiers, made by the best workers anywhere in the world. And thatâs true. A lot of people are asking, because they love me, and they ask me about a man named John McCain."
00:10:16 - 00:10:21 (5 sec),"And if you want, I could tell you about -- should I or not? Yes? Yes? [Audience calls out Yes]"
00:10:21 - 00:10:51 (30 sec),"So, I have to be honest: I've never liked him much. Hasnât been for me. I've really -- probably never will. But there are certain reasons for it, and I'll tell you. And I do this to save a little time with the press later on. John McCain received a fake and phony dossier. Did you hear about the dossier? It was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton."
00:10:51 - 00:10:53 (2 sec),Right? [Audience Boos]
00:10:53 - 00:11:14 (21 sec),"And John McCain got it. He got it. And what did he do? He didnât call me. He turned it over to the FBI, hoping to put me in jeopardy. And that's not the nicest thing to do. You know, when those people say -- because I'm a very loyal person. John McCain campaigned for years to repeal and replace Obamacare -- for years, in Arizona."
00:11:14 - 00:11:40 (26 sec),"A great state. I love the people of Arizona. But he campaigned, for years, for ""repeal and replace."" So did Rob and so did a lot of senators. When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against ""repeal and replace."" He voted against, at 2 o'clock in the morning. Remember ""thumbs down""? We said, ""What the hell happened?"" He said, two hours before, he was voting to repeal and replace."
00:11:40 - 00:12:08 (28 sec),"And then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican Party, badly hurting our nation, and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable healthcare. We would've had it. This would've saved our country over a trillion dollars in entitlements, and we would have ended up making a great healthcare plan, frankly, with the Democrats because they would have had no choice."
00:12:08 - 00:12:41 (33 sec),"McCain didnât get the job done for our great vets and the VA, and they knew it. That's why, when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got Choice and I got Accountability. Accountability -- meaning, if somebody mistreats our vets -- for 45 years they were trying -- they mistreat our vets, and we say, ""Hey, you're fired."
00:12:41 - 00:13:01 (20 sec),"Get out."" You can't mistreat our vets. They never got it done. And Choice -- for year and years, decades, they wanted to get Choice. You know what Choice is. You're a military person. You're one of our great people. To me, one of the great people. For many decades, they couldnât get it done."
00:13:01 - 00:13:26 (25 sec),"It was never done. I got it five months ago. I got it done -- Choice. Instead of waiting in line -- a vet fought for us, fought in these tanks; fought for us. Instead of waiting in line for two days, two weeks, two months -- people on line, they're not very sick. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill."
00:13:26 - 00:13:53 (27 sec),"We gave them Choice. If you have to wait for any extended period of time, you go outside, you go to a local doctor. We pay the bill; you get yourself better. Go home to your family. And we got it passed. We got it done. And the other thing is we're in a war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush -- President Bush -- all the time: ""Get into the Middle East."
00:13:53 - 00:14:20 (27 sec),"Get into the Middle East."" So now we're into that war for $7 trillion. Thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we're straightening it out now, but it's been a disaster for our country. We've spent tremendous wealth -- tremendous wealth -- and tremendous lives in that war."
00:14:20 - 00:14:42 (23 sec),"And what do we have? It's worse than it was 19 years ago. I call them the ""endless wars."" Nineteen years ago, when we started. So, John McCain loved it. I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted -- which, as President, I had to approve. I donât care about this. I didnât get ""thank you."" That's okay."
00:14:42 - 00:15:06 (24 sec),"We sent him on the way. But I wasnât a fan of John McCain. So now, what we could say is: Now we're all set. I donât think I have to answer that question, but the press keeps, ""What do you think of McCain? What do you think?"" Not my kind of guy. But some people like him, and I think that's great. Now let's get back and let's get on to the subject of tanks and this economy."
00:15:06 - 00:15:41 (35 sec),"Because you know what? We love what we are and what we do more than anything else. We build great, we fight great, and we're right now in Lima, and Lima is an incredible place, a place of strength and dedication. Since 1941, this plant has built and serviced thousands of tanks and military vehicles that powered American forces through World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan."
00:15:41 - 00:16:14 (34 sec),"And the tanks are the best in the world -- better than ever before. Every single Abrams tank in existence -- the steel and the aluminum warhorse; theyâre really a warhorse of American ground forces -- it was built or serviced on these very grounds by you people. By you people. But under the previous administration, this tank factory -- the last of its kind anywhere in the Western Hemisphere -- came very close to shutting down."
00:16:14 - 00:16:40 (26 sec),"Four straight years, the number of U.S. tanks that were budgeted for upgrades was zero. Does anybody remember that? Raise your hands. Do you remember that? Zero. That was under your great President Obama. Our military readiness declined and your workforce was slashed by 60 percent. But those days are over."
00:16:40 - 00:17:09 (29 sec),"We are rebuilding the American military. We are restoring American manufacturing. And we are once again fighting for our great American workers. Over the last two years, we have secured nearly $1.5 trillion to provide our warfighters the finest aircraft, ships, missiles, and tanks anywhere on Earth. We make the best equipment on Earth."
00:17:09 - 00:17:38 (29 sec),"And we sell that equipment, as you know, to good allies. Although, sometimes the good ones turn out to be not so good, and then we do something. We figure it out. You know what you have to do? You figure it out. This year, weâre asking for an additional $750 billion, which is a record. That includes funding to upgrade more than 160 mighty M1 Abrams tanks."
00:17:38 - 00:18:12 (33 sec),"Congratulations. Congratulations. These historic investments are making America safer and our workforce stronger. From the awe-inspiring F-35 fighter in Texas to the Ford-class aircraft carriers in Virginia -- weâre now building the largest aircraft carrier anywhere in the world. In fact, Iâm hearing itâs actually the largest ship ever built."
00:18:12 - 00:18:40 (29 sec),"It is seriously big. I was there recently. Itâs something -- itâs like landing at an airport, although you have to be very talented, still, to land on those decks, no matter how you figure it. Some people can do it and some people can't. Some very good pilots can. To advance missile defense systems in Alabama, American workers are building the most cutting-edge, modern, and powerful military anywhere on the planet."
00:18:40 - 00:19:02 (22 sec),"At the heart of our military rebuilding is our investment in the legendary M1 Abrams tank. And I will tell you, the investment has paid off because the technology is so -- if you look at this tank from now, and you go back 10 years and look at the tank, itâs a like a whole different -- itâs a whole different deal, isnât it? A whole different deal."
00:19:02 - 00:19:24 (22 sec),"Over the next three years, weâre investing more than $6 billion in upgrades and modifications to these tanks -- thatâs going to keep you very busy here -- almost twice the amount spent in the entire eight years of the previous administration, which was going down to nothing. Because you were closed; this place was closed."
00:19:24 - 00:19:45 (22 sec),"And I heard about it. And I got calls from Jim Jordan and Rob, and everybody, saying, âYou just canât do this.â And after I studied the situation, I said, âWeâre not only not going to close in Lima, weâre going to expand.â And thatâs what took place. So you owe a lot to a lot of your great political leaders."
00:19:45 - 00:20:21 (36 sec),"Our investment -- our investment in you is also a tremendous win for American taxpayers. By modernizing this plant and accelerating production, we will bring the cost down by 20 percent, saving taxpayers nearly $3 million on every single tank. Thatâs not bad. With the help of everyone in this room, we are giving our warriors the most effective, reliable, and lethal battle tank in the history of war."
00:20:21 - 00:20:52 (31 sec),"Would you say thatâs correct? So how does this compare with the tanks made in China and Russia and other places? What do you think? Can we take them? They say itâs much better. America does not need conflict. But if conflict comes, and you know the story -- youâve got to be strong if conflict comes -- we will dominate the battlefield, and we will win, win, win."
00:20:52 - 00:21:30 (38 sec),"Weâre now set up to win, win, win. When I came in, we had some big problems. You look at what weâve done on so many fronts. And we actually have better relationships. They respect our country more than theyâve ever respected it. Our country is respected again. The United States is respected again. To help meet our military needs, I am very proud to report that 400 new jobs are coming here to Lima, compared to just a few years ago, and weâre doubling the size of your workforce."
00:21:30 - 00:22:00 (30 sec),"We need to. Our investment will also support thousands of additional jobs across our nation to assemble these incredible Abrams tanks. The engines are from Alabama, transmissions are from Indiana, special armor from Idaho, and the 120-millimeter gun -- and the gun parts from upstate New York and from Pennsylvania."
00:22:00 - 00:22:46 (45 sec),"All great places. In Ohio alone, almost 200 suppliers churn out parts and materials that go into every tank that rolls off this factoryâs floor. Incredible. What you achieve here at this plant is truly remarkable. And equally remarkable is that they wanted to close it. No good. Every day you start with a powerful, heavy, but sometimes rust-covered, hollowed-out hull -- and with incredible skill and extraordinary care -- you restore its unmatched power, strength, and glory with all brand new equipment inside."
00:22:46 - 00:23:19 (33 sec),"The best in the world. The amazing restorations you accomplish every day are a perfect symbol for what we're doing with American manufacturing all across our nation. And we just came out -- another chart -- we just came out with numbers -- the Economic Report of the President: 3.1 percent GDP. The first time in 14 years that we cracked 3, right?"
00:23:19 - 00:23:43 (24 sec),"That's pretty good -- 3.1. The press tried to make it 2.9. I said, ""It's not 2.9."" What they did is they took odd months. I said, ""No, no, no. You go from January to December. You don't take certain months and add them up."" Because I said, ""We're going to break 3."" And we did. We did 3.1. The fake news tried to change it but we caught them."
00:23:43 - 00:24:15 (32 sec),"[Laughter] I said -- I said, ""You know, we didn't break the 3. Oh, that's terrible."" They said, ""Yes, sir, you did. They just took odd months."" I said, ""No, no, January to December."" 3.1 percent, first time in 14 years. Congratulations. Sort of incredible. It's true. This chart is a beauty. This is ""Venture Capital Deals Surged Following the Passage of"" -- really, the election -- rising nearly $17 billion."
00:24:15 - 00:24:49 (34 sec),"You know what that means. So here's your charts -- going along -- and here's us. See the red line there? It's like a rocket ship. Can you see that? It's small but cheap -- [Laughter] -- and it gets the point across, right? A couple of other things -- because I think this report is incredible. So these are ""Workers Coming Off the Sidelines,"" and now it's just -- this is just partially."
00:24:49 - 00:25:11 (22 sec),"So, the blue. The blue. The red. That's a big difference. That's a tremendous difference. The most in many, many years. And everyone said, ""You couldn't do it, couldn't bring back manufacturing jobs."" Remember? ""You'd need a magic wand."" We're bringing them back beyond anybody's expectations. You see the red line here?"
00:25:11 - 00:25:42 (30 sec),"These are ""Wages are Rising for the Workers."" These are ""Wages are Rising."" 3.4 percent -- it's one of the largest increases in 20 years. And for the most part, they were going down. They weren't even rising. I used to campaign -- I'd be in Ohio, I'd be in Pennsylvania, I'd be all over, and I'd talk about wages where people would have to work three jobs and they were making less than they did 20 years ago."
00:25:42 - 00:26:04 (22 sec),"You remember that, Rob? Jim? I used to do it all the time. I'd be -- it was just a part of my speech. I'd say, ""You're working three jobs. You make less money than you did 20 years ago."" And it was literally 21 years. And now wages are going up. And you have something else that's happening. If you don't like working here -- and you all do -- and I don't want to lose anybody."
00:26:04 - 00:26:23 (20 sec),"And who the hell would want to leave this place? This is what you call a great -- a great place to work. But if for any reason -- if for any reason you did, you can pick out six, seven, eight other jobs. In other words, you can finally have a job that you really like, where you like getting up in the morning."
00:26:23 - 00:26:47 (24 sec),"I do. I do, even though I have the fake news hounding me all the time. The fake and phony and corrupt. It's fake. It's corrupt. But we got to live with it, right? Got to live with it. But you guys -- you do; you get up in the morning, you love to come, and you love your job, or you wouldn't be doing what I just witnessed back there when I looked at some of these incredible tanks."
00:26:47 - 00:27:09 (21 sec),"And here's another chart: ""Deregulating and Saving"" -- through the roof. Here's a chart: ""The American Energy."" The United States is the largest producer -- that's happened over the last short period of time -- of crude oil and natural gas in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. We're also a net -- do you think Russia is happy about this?"
00:27:09 - 00:27:35 (26 sec),"I don't think so. You know, Hillary wanted to put windmills all over the place. Let's put up some windmills. ""When the wind doesn't blow, just turn off the television, darling, please."" [Laughter] ""No wind out today. There's no wind. Please turn off the television, quickly."" [Laughter] Put the windmills up and watch the value of your house -- if you're in sight of a windmill, watch the value of your house go down by 65 percent."
00:27:35 - 00:28:01 (26 sec),"Wonderful to have windmills. And solar is wonderful too, but it's not strong enough and it's very, very expensive. So the United States is now the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Happened all in that very short -- you know, you guys are all so -- think of that. Think of that, beating out Saudi Arabia and Russia."
00:28:01 - 00:28:25 (24 sec),"They're pretty good producers, right? Guess what? We do more than they do. And in a short period of time, as soon as we get some pipelines opened in Texas, we'll be able to almost double it. Double it. What we're doing is incredible. We approved the Keystone Pipeline. Right? I did that. Forty-eight thousand jobs between that and the Dakota Access Pipeline."
00:28:25 - 00:28:46 (21 sec),"I got them approved, like almost my first couple of days in office. I said, ""They're approved."" And what is it? It's good environmentally. It's underground. You're not riding it over tracks. You're not trucking it. It's actually a great thing, environmentally. But President Obama, after years and years and years, they said, ""We're not going to approve it."" I said, ""We'll approve it."" Forty-eight thousand jobs."
00:28:46 - 00:29:06 (20 sec),"Think of it. It's being built right now. They're both being built. One just got completed -- Dakota Access. And many, many other cases like that. Plants all over the country are going up. But the thing that's the greatest is companies that left us -- they no longer wanted to be in the USA -- they're coming roaring back."
00:29:06 - 00:29:30 (24 sec),"Toyota -- $13.5 billion. We've created more than almost 6 million jobs since the election. And if I would have said that to the fake news during the campaign, they would've said, ""He exaggerates."" I'm not exaggerating, but nobody would've believed that could happen. Including almost 600,000 manufacturing jobs."
00:29:30 - 00:29:58 (28 sec),"We could've taken your jobs, all. If it werenât for me, this place would've been closed. Would have been closed. Would have been closed, fellas. And you're doing us a favor because of the great job you do. It's not just a one-way street. You're doing us a favor. Last year, our manufacturers reported the highest level of optimism ever recorded in a 40-year-old poll."
00:29:58 - 00:30:36 (37 sec),"And this year we went up again. Went from 56 percent -- and it stayed there for years, between 50 and 56 -- to 94 percent. They've never had anything like it. Thatâs optimism. And we -- all of us -- are living by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. Very simple. Unemployment has recently reached the lowest rate in 51 years."
00:30:36 - 00:31:02 (27 sec),"Other than that, we're not doing well. [Laughter] More -- and think of this: More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million people. More than ever before, by far. And if you look at African American -- you've heard me say this many times -- African American employment is at an all-time low -- unemployment."
00:31:02 - 00:31:32 (30 sec),"Asian American unemployment is at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment -- an all-time low. Women's unemployment -- 65-year low. Soon it'll be historic, meaning better than ever. And soon the basic number will be historic. We've reduced the number of unemployed veterans by nearly 50 percent. I'm so proud of that."
00:31:32 - 00:32:01 (29 sec),"Thatâs why the veterans like me more than other people. That's why they like me. Fifty percent since the election. And veteran unemployment is now at the lowest level ever, ever, ever recorded. Thanks to our pro-American tax, regulatory, and trade policies -- and, by the way, we're doing great in our deal with China."
00:32:01 - 00:32:28 (26 sec),"They were taking out 500 billion a year for many years from our country. I consider that we've rebuilt China. Five hundred billion, not million. Think of what that means. Five-hundred billion dollars a year taken out of our country. And now they're paying us. They're paying tariffs on the products they're sending in, and we're negotiating and they want to make a deal."
00:32:28 - 00:32:50 (22 sec),"And hopefully, we'll make a deal. And if we don't, thatâs fine. And if we do, thatâs fine. It's got to be a good deal. It can't be a bad deal. We're so far down, it's got to be a great deal. If itâs not a great deal, we'll never catch up. And their economy is way down. And I donât want their economy to be down; I want their economy to be up. But their economy is down 32 to 38 percent."
00:32:50 - 00:33:11 (22 sec),"And our economy, if you look at the numbers, since my election, is up almost 50 percent. Fifty. Thatâs some difference. And the world economy -- the world economy is not good. And frankly, if the world economy were good, that would be, in a way, good for us. So we're fighting there. We're bucking."
00:33:11 - 00:33:36 (25 sec),"Europe is down, Asia is down -- a lot of places. Almost every place is down. Except the United States is up. And we're way up. And just think of what that would be. The world goes up; we go up with the world. The world is down, but we still go up. Something is happening. That wouldnât happen under Barack Obama, that I can tell you."
00:33:36 - 00:34:19 (43 sec),"It wouldnât happen under Crooked Hillary Clinton. [Laughter] Last week, as I said, Toyota announced a massive investment. They're going to be expanding factories all across our nation. And they're going to be soon building new ones. Ford is bringing hundreds of new jobs to Chicago and other places. Tremendous amount of car companies are coming into the great state of Michigan, and they're coming into the great state of Ohio."
00:34:19 - 00:35:10 (50 sec),"Volkswagen is creating 1,000 brand new jobs in the state of Tennessee. And Chrysler is building Detroitâs first new car factory in a generation -- so long ago -- in a generation. Think of that. Michigan. Michigan. You know, the nice part about running for President this time, as opposed to last time -- last time, you know, I said I was going to do it, but I didnât do it. But I said I was going to do it. This time, I've done it far greater than I said I was going to do it. So it's going to be really easy on the debate stage when they hit me with nonsense and I say, ""Really?"
00:35:10 - 00:35:45 (35 sec),"But African American unemployment -- the best it's ever been."" Hispanic, Asian, women, everybody -- itâs all the best itâs ever been. How do you top that in a debate? What are they going to say? ""Uh, well, it could be better""? [Laughter] No, the easy part -- and I say this to all of your political leaders here -- if you do a good job, it's a lot easier that second time."
00:35:45 - 00:35:57 (12 sec),"But nobody has done the job that we've done. And I say ""we"" because you've been on our side. Your union leaders aren't on my side, by the way. I watched them on television. They're not. But the unions -- the people that work there are on our side. It's true. It's true. I had -- [Audience chants Trump]"
00:35:57 - 00:36:18 (21 sec),"I had union leaders in the White House a few months ago -- the biggest guys. Nice guys, but they're Democrats no matter what. Okay? And you see where that's taken you. That would've been catastrophic. But I had them in, and we explained how good it was for the car industry, for this, for that. They said, ""Oh, thank you, sir."
00:36:18 - 00:36:46 (28 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this is unbelievable. Thank you, sir."" But then I see one of the guys the next day on a television show. The -- I think it was called ""Deface the Nation."" [Laughter] And -- ladies and gentlemen, ""Deface the Nation."" And he's saying how he's a Democrat and he wants Democrat policies -- which were, by the way, putting everybody in the poorhouse."
00:36:46 - 00:37:16 (30 sec),"But I just left the guy. He's hugging me, kissing me, telling him what an unbelievable deal. Nobody else could do it. And the next day, he's on there talking about stuff. And I really said, ""I sort of don't want to meet these guys. I want to deal with the people in the union, not the heads of the union."" Because the heads of the union are not honest people."
00:37:16 - 00:37:48 (31 sec),"They're not honest, and they ought to lower your dues, by the way. They ought to stop with the dues. They -- you're paying too much dues. As an example, they could've kept General Motors. They could've kept it in that gorgeous plant at Lordstown. They could've kept it. Lower your dues. Lower your dues."
00:37:48 - 00:38:17 (30 sec),"Americaâs Founders understood that to be strong and powerful as a nation, we must also be a great manufacturing nation. President Obama said, ""You'll never bring manufacturing back."" I said, ""What are you talking about?"" It's all about manufacturing. And we're bringing it back in record numbers. Nobody can believe it. And these are talented jobs."
00:38:17 - 00:39:00 (43 sec),"These are great jobs. These are genius jobs. And these are really well-paying jobs, as you people know. You get a lot of money. Letâs negotiate. [Laughter] We must not be dependent upon others for the resources we need to protect our people. When we open this plant, a couple of my people -- I have some good business people -- they said, ""Let's make a deal with the workers before we open it. We'll make a great deal."" I said, ""I agree we can do that, but we're not going to do that."
00:39:00 - 00:39:17 (17 sec),"These people have suffered enough."" We're going to open the plant and everybody is going to be happy. You understand what I mean by that. That's why my administration is restoring Americaâs defense industrial base by bringing great jobs and great wages to plants just like this in Lima. Economy and strength is security."
00:39:17 - 00:39:40 (23 sec),"And it's all about security and national security. It's about loving our country. It's about loving our flag. You know that. Now, as result of my very tough trade actions -- something I'm very proud of -- America's steel and our steel mills are roaring back to life. You know that. You see it all over."
00:39:40 - 00:40:10 (31 sec),"We put a big, fat beautiful tariff on that dumped steel. It's sand steel. It's mud steel. It's crap steel. And they're dumping it all over. I said, ""That's okay, you can dump but we're going to charge you 25 percent when you come in and think you're going to take our jobs and give us bad steel."" I know a lot about -- I've used a lot of steel."
00:40:10 - 00:40:34 (24 sec),"Right here in Ohio, Nucor has just announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a brand new, 150-million-dollar steel plant in Cuyahoga Heights. JSW Steel is restarting the furnace -- that's a massive furnace -- and investing $500 million in Mingo Junction."
00:40:34 - 00:41:03 (29 sec),"And Cleveland Cliffs announced a brand new, 700-million-dollar plant in Toledo, Ohio. Don't leave here, though. Donât leave here. Don't get any ideas. Don't get leave here. Just stay here. Just relax. Stay here. We don't want you going to Mingo Junction. We're also finally fixing the horrible trade deals that have cost our nation trillions of dollars and where we've lost millions and millions and millions of jobs, like we were stupid people."
00:41:03 - 00:41:28 (25 sec),"They closed a plant; they move it to Mexico. They make the product; they sell it right in the United States. No tax. All we end up with is loss and no jobs. We get no taxes. We get nothing. That doesn't happen anymore. Under our new deal, there's a tremendous financial disincentive to close up plants and move them to other countries."
00:41:28 - 00:41:43 (15 sec),"You're not going to see that anymore. And we're getting rid of the disaster known as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated in the history of the world. All over the country, you still see empty plants, when they haven't been converted to nursing homes and apartments, right?"
00:41:43 - 00:42:10 (27 sec),"It's not the same thing as a plant. I love apartments. I love the business. But that's not the same thing as a plant where you have 5,000 people working. Not the same thing. And replacing it -- we're replacing NAFTA with the great U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Like the song. If you can't remember -- YMCA, right?"
00:42:10 - 00:42:31 (20 sec),"We'll play the song for you, everybody. USMCA. We've taken historic action to confront Chinaâs trading abuses, because the days of stealing American jobs and our ideas and our wealth have come to an end, folks. They've come to an idea, all right? They've come to an end. We've made some progress."
00:42:31 - 00:42:57 (26 sec),"That's why you see these numbers. Look at that chart. Look at that. You don't have to know what's on it. What difference -- look at the line. [Laughter] You don't have to know what the hell is on it. All you know is thatâs a good line. [Laughter] Technological positive change. That's okay, right? It's all like that."
00:42:57 - 00:43:42 (45 sec),"That's what it is. Rob, Jim, that's what it is. Turner, see that? Look. That's what we fight for, right? Huh? That's what we're all fighting for. In everything we do and every action we take, we're putting America first, and we are putting American workers first, for the first time in a long time. So just in closing, I'd like to now introduce a couple of truly incredible workers from right here -- I guess you know these folks -- right here at the tank plant to share quickly their stories with you."
00:43:42 - 00:44:05 (23 sec),"Adam Stahler is a Quality Engineer who has worked at the plant for 10 years. His son, Derek, is a Specialist with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas. Great Place. Derek operates and maintains Stryker personnel carriers, one of the vehicles produced right here in Lima. Adam, thank you for everything your family has done for our nation."
00:44:05 - 00:44:07 (2 sec),"Please come up and say a few words. Adam, thank you."
00:44:07 - 00:44:55 (49 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. It's a pleasure and an honor to be up here today as a representative of the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center. For those of you who don't me, my name is Adam Stahler. I'm a Quality Systems Engineer employed here going on 10 years. Growing up in the area and currently living in Wapakoneta, I have witnessed the highs and lows the economy has had on this facility and the region."
00:44:55 - 00:45:10 (15 sec),"I'm proud that this administration recognizes the importance of this facility and the value we provide to the warfighter. It is very rewarding to have a son serving the United States military, where he is stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, working on a quality vehicle produced by my brothers and sisters at JSMC."
00:45:10 - 00:45:11 (1 sec),My son thanks you.
00:45:11 - 00:45:13 (1 sec),"And for that, I thank you."
00:45:13 - 00:45:23 (10 sec),"Boy, you're a young guy. How old are you?"
00:45:23 - 00:45:24 (1 sec),Forty-five.
00:45:24 - 00:45:27 (3 sec),Wow. You look like your son.
00:45:27 - 00:45:28 (1 sec),"Oh, thank you."
00:45:28 - 00:45:54 (26 sec),"Thank you. I thought Adam was the son. Look how young he looks. [Laughter] He's got a son working out there? Wow. Whatever you're eating, Adam, keep eating it. [Laughter] It's working. Jay Baldwin is a Boiler Operator and a proud Army veteran. After serving as a tank crewman on the M1, now Jay helps build the M1 right here."
00:45:54 - 00:45:57 (3 sec),"You know him. Jay, please come on up."
00:45:57 - 00:46:12 (16 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President, for coming to our plant in Lima, Ohio. As a former Army M1 tanker, I can honestly say that we make the best tank in the entire world. Our workers here are very proud to be making such a fine product for our soldiers to have the benefit and best capabilities on the battlefield."
00:46:12 - 00:46:37 (24 sec),"And thanks to our great President, his military and economic policies have rejuvenated this facility to increase production of armored vehicles and hiring of more skilled workers. And finally, it is my personal opinion that God was looking after our country when you were elected. Mr. President, thank you for everything you have done."
00:46:37 - 00:46:44 (8 sec),"Thank you, truthfully."
00:46:44 - 00:47:08 (24 sec),"Wow. Thank you. Thank you. That's so nice, Jay and Adam. I appreciate it. You never know what you get when you come up. It's live. [Laughter] But you couldnât do better than that, right? Thatâs great. Thank you, fellas. Thatâs great. I want to also thank all of the patriots here today. You remind us that the might of Americaâs armed forces also depends upon the skill and devotion of all of America's workers."
00:47:08 - 00:47:39 (31 sec),"And you really are doing a job. Weâre very proud of you. For nearly 80 years, the exceptional workers at this plant has embodied the strength of the American spirit. Those who choose to work here are drawn not just by the promise of a good paycheck but by the power of patriotism -- every single one of you is a patriot -- the chance to go to work every morning to help protect this nation that we so deeply love."
00:47:39 - 00:48:15 (36 sec),"Thatâs why veterans make up more than one third of the workforce at this wonderful plant. We very much stress: We want, wherever we can, we want veterans. Thatâs why you check -- right? Thatâs right. And thatâs why you check and recheck every bolt, every single thing having to do with that incredible tank -- every pin, every wire, every square inch of each tank before it leaves the floor."
00:48:15 - 00:48:39 (24 sec),"And I just got a little news that was given to me as I was walking up. U.S. forces, in the last month, have killed the terrorists responsible for the attack in Syria that killed four Americans, the Paris theater attack in 2015, and the USS Cole bombing in 2000. We killed them all. We killed them all."
00:48:39 - 00:49:33 (54 sec),"We killed them all. We killed them all. Theyâre bad people. But thatâs why you show up early and you stay late, and always get the job done right. Youâre proud of your work. You do it better than anyone, anywhere in the world -- what you do. No country on Earth can match you and no country can match what you do. In just a few months, we will commemorate the 75th anniversary of one of the many victories that workers at the Lima Army Tank Plant helped make possible: the Normandy landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944, in the Second World War."
00:49:33 - 00:49:47 (14 sec),It was right here on these very grounds that thousands of American workers modified M4 Sherman tanks in preparation for a battle that would forever change the course of human history.
00:49:47 - 00:50:18 (32 sec),Right here. The workers who rallied to the Lima plant came from all over northwest Ohio and beyond. They were farmers and refinery workers and shopkeepers and homemakers who rolled up their sleeves and got to work when their country needed them the most. Normandy. Many of them had full-time jobs elsewhere.
00:50:18 - 00:50:47 (29 sec),"They punched out at one job, then came here and punched right back in. Not for the money. They knew and fully understood the importance of what they did and what they represented. And if they were lucky, they might catch a few hoursâ sleep on the loading dock before doing it all again, day after day, day after day."
00:50:47 - 00:51:20 (32 sec),"In just three years, the patriots of Ohio cranked out more than 100,000 military vehicles -- a truly amazing feat that helped give America the power to vanquish tyranny, defeat our enemies, and save freedom for the entire world. This is the legacy that each of you inherits. And America knows you will carry it forward with the same purpose and passion that you've poured into this factory each and every day."
00:51:20 - 00:51:57 (37 sec),"We love you. We see your legacy in every battlefield victory, in the smiling faces of every soldier that returns home safely, and every time a citizen proudly salutes our great American flag. Because it is here in Lima -- right here -- that American greatness is forged with American hands, with American heart, and with American pride."
00:51:57 - 00:52:30 (32 sec),"True. True. We donât know what challenges will come, what dangers we must face, or what opportunities we must seize. But we know that America will always be ready because of you and your strength, and your skill and your drive, and your unbreakable spirit. Because of hardworking citizens like you, the people of Lima, the people of Ohio, and the people of America will always fight on to victory, victory, victory."
00:52:30 - 00:53:08 (38 sec),"You donât know how to lose. You never will have to find out. Youâll never have to find out about losing. Together, we shall forever be one nation, under God. So I want to thank you. I want to say God bless you, God bless Ohio, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody.Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:38 (38 sec),"Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you very much also to a man named Matt Schlapp. What a job he's done. And to CPAC -- I actually started quite a while ago at CPAC, and came here -- probably made my first real political speech. And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third."
00:00:38 - 00:01:16 (38 sec),"Then I said, what the hell, let's run for President. Right? But it's wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives. What a future you have. Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited. What we've done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world."
00:01:16 - 00:01:55 (40 sec),"They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities. They came from all over. And what we did in 2016 -- the Election, we call it, with a capital ""E"" -- it's never been done before. And we're going to do it, I think, again in 2020, and the numbers are going to be even bigger. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:01:55 - 00:02:20 (24 sec),"And we all had to endure, as I was running. So you had 17 Republicans, plus me. [Laughter] And I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican. People just didnât quite understand that. They didnât understand it. I think now, with what we've done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well."
00:02:20 - 00:02:48 (29 sec),"And it's driving the other side crazy. But we all had to endure, remember? How many times did you hear, for months and months, ""There is no way to 270""? You know what that means, right? ""There is no way to 270."" They couldnât get me there. We might as well have just given up. But there wasnât any way to 270. In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one."
00:02:48 - 00:03:36 (48 sec),"But we didnât need the one. We didnât need it. We won Maine. We won our half of Maine, remember? You have Nebraska. We won both in Nebraska. We won the half we had to win in Maine. So we got the one, but we didnât need the one, because we didnât get 270; we got 306 to 223. 223-306. A state called Wisconsin, a state called -- Michigan, where -- by the way, where Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion incredible -- expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce."
00:03:36 - 00:04:12 (36 sec),"Many, many car companies have moved back to Michigan and are continuing to do so. Big numbers. Nobody every thought they'd see that happen. So I think we're going to do even better in 2020. I think we're going to do numbers that people havenât seen for a long time. The men and women here today are on the frontlines of protecting Americaâs interests, defending Americaâs value, and reclaiming our nationâs priceless heritage."
00:04:12 - 00:05:07 (55 sec),"It's true. With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals. These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for. It's been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense. It wasnât ""America first."" In many cases, it was ""America last."" Those days are over."
00:05:07 - 00:05:43 (36 sec),"Long over. America is winning again. America is respected again. And the world knows it. When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents -- and I get along with them -- because they know that what's taken place over many years -- not just the Obama administration; long before that -- they can't believe, themselves, that they got away with it. They can't believe it. An impossible thing."
00:05:43 - 00:06:14 (31 sec),"And they like me. And the reason they like me -- they tell me; they say, ""Mr. President..."" I said -- as an example, President Xi of China, I have great respect. We have a great relationship. I say, ""How is it possible that you got away with this for so long?"" [Laughter] And he said, ""Because nobody ever asked us to change."" It's true."
00:06:14 - 00:06:43 (30 sec),"When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent and then to 40 percent -- and they said to me, ""We expected that somebody would call and say you can't do that."" [Laughter] ""Nobody called, so we just left it."" And I donât blame them."
00:06:43 - 00:07:16 (33 sec),We shouldâve been doing the same thing to them. But we didnât. True. Right? Hard to believe. It's hard to believe. But now things are different. Now we're negotiating with China. They wouldnât negotiate with previous administrations. But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich -- really rich.
00:07:16 - 00:08:07 (51 sec),"The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty. But, fortunately, they werenât terminated. We started getting politically correct, even back then. But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws? And I checked, and I found 301 and 382. I found one, 1938, where we can do what we have to do. But, you know, they had a debate in -- it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we didnât know what the hell to do with it. Tough, tough, tough."
00:08:07 - 00:08:29 (22 sec),"It was called the Great Tariff Debate. Mark Levin will look this up. [Laughter] And the problem is, with Mark, if I make a little mistake, he'll let us know on Sunday night. [Laughter] I got to be very careful when I talk about this. But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888. And the debate was: We didnât know what to do with all of the money we were making."
00:08:29 - 00:08:44 (16 sec),"We were so rich. And McKinley, prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country. And he made statements that, ""Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country. We can't do that. We can't ever allow that to happen."" And, you know -- I don't know, maybe you know."
00:08:44 - 00:08:45 (1 sec),"You know I'm totally off-script, right? [Audience member calls out]"
00:08:45 - 00:09:02 (16 sec),"Thank you, darling. [Laughter] You know I'm totally off script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off script. True. And if we donât go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks. Because we have to get it back. And when I look at what's happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, ""No, no..."" -- I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it -- [Audience Boos] [Audience Boos]"
00:09:02 - 00:09:43 (41 sec),"The Green New Deal, right? Green New Deal -- I encourage it. I think it's really something that they should promote. [Laughter] They should work hard on. It's something our country needs desperately. They have to go out and get it. But I'll take the other side of that argument only because I'm mandated to. I'm mandated."
00:09:43 - 00:09:59 (16 sec),"But they should stay with that argument. Never change. [Laughter] Never change. No planes. No energy. [Laughter] When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric. [Laughter] Let's hurry up. ""Darling"" -- ""Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling."" [Laughter] No, but it's true."
00:09:59 - 00:10:46 (47 sec),"So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 -- and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted. We built forces up that were incredible. Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay? They ended tariffs. Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs. They said, ""Oh, it's okay for other nations to come in."" I won't use a certain words because it's not politically -- but everybody knows the word I'd love to use."
00:10:46 - 00:11:13 (27 sec),"Should I use it? I won't do it. Our great First Lady always said, ""Don't use certain words, please."" I said, ""But the audience wanted me to do it."" She said, ""Don't do it."" And the problem is, if I do do that, they won't put the little preamble that we just went through. They'll just use the word, and they'll said, ""Isn't that terrible."" So I won't use it. [Laughter] I've learned."
00:11:13 - 00:11:14 (2 sec),Because with the fake news -- [Audience Boos]
00:11:14 - 00:11:59 (45 sec),"-- if you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, ""Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please."" ""Please get us the emails. Please!"" [Audience chants Trump]"
00:11:59 - 00:12:19 (19 sec),"So everybody is having a good time. I'm laughing, we're all having fun. And then that fake CNN and others say, ""He asked Russia to go get the emails. Horrible."" [Laughter] I mean, I thought -- like, two weeks ago, I'm watching and they're talking about one of the points. ""He asked Russia for the emails."" These people are sick."
00:12:19 - 00:12:49 (30 sec),"[Laughter] And I'm telling you, they know the game. They know the game, and they play it dirty -- dirtier than anybody has ever played the game. Dirtier than it's ever been played. But the thing that we've done is very special. Because, on trade, and because of tariffs -- and I know there are people in the Republican Party and people -- really, even conservatives -- good conservatives -- they donât like tariffs."
00:12:49 - 00:13:14 (26 sec),"I'm not liking or not liking. The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country. Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over? Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods. I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion."
00:13:14 - 00:13:59 (45 sec),"Not like $200 million -- that's a lot. This is 200 with a ""B"" -- billion. Two-hundred billion. So -- but I was nice, because we're having a very strong negotiation, which if it werenât for tariffs -- and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide. I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position."
00:13:59 - 00:14:22 (23 sec),"But in my case, it can't, because it's true. I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion. And here's the beauty: We've lost so much money with China -- $500 billion a year. And on trade, it's such a disaster; it's $507 billion a year. China -- just one country. We lose with everybody, almost."
00:14:22 - 00:14:54 (32 sec),"But China is one country. $507 billion, for many years. So the beauty is this: I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on. The numbers are staggering. Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury. And for those of you that havenât done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country -- as it's turned out, because it's now been on there for a long while."
00:14:54 - 00:15:24 (29 sec),"Our -- and I'm in no rush because I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it. Of the 25 points, we've paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points. Okay? Twenty-one. Thatâs what the numbers are. It's very simple. You know, everyone said, ""Oh, it's a tax on our..."" It's not really. And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it. So the tax really is incredible."
00:15:24 - 00:15:38 (14 sec),"But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate. But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not Mark Meadows. Where is the great Mark Meadows? He's here someplace. Man, has he been good. Mark and Jim Jordan, and -- I want to name every one of those couple of hundred people."
00:15:38 - 00:15:57 (19 sec),"Because we do have a lot. I want to name every damn one of them. They have been incredible. They've been fighting. And I just see Mark in the audience. They've been fighting -- with Deb, much more important. His wife is incredible. What an asset. He would be nowhere without her. [Laughter] Right?"
00:15:57 - 00:16:20 (22 sec),"But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it's dying. So they donât have anything with Russia. There's no collusion. So now they go and morph into, ""Let's inspect every deal he's ever done. We're going to go into his finances."
00:16:20 - 00:16:39 (19 sec),"We're going to check his deals. We're going to check..."" These people are sick. [Laughter] They're sick. I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday. No, it's the first time. He went into a meeting and he said, ""We're going to look into his finances."" I said, ""Where did that come from?"" He always talked about Russia -- collusion with Russia."
00:16:39 - 00:16:55 (17 sec),"The collusion delusion. [Laughter] So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out whether or not, and who we're dealing with. We're waiting for a report by people that werenât elected. We had -- think of this: We had the greatest election -- in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson."
00:16:55 - 00:17:25 (30 sec),"This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I'm not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater. You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan, when I first started. ""This is Ronald Reagan."" Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote."
00:17:25 - 00:17:50 (26 sec),"Those red hats -- and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. ""Make America Great Again,"" is what it says. Right? Right? But we had the greatest of all time. Now we have people that lost. And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there."
00:17:50 - 00:18:15 (24 sec),"And, all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit. Okay? [Laughter] With bullshit. Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the Attorney General says, ""I'm going to recuse myself."" [Laughter] ""I'm going to recuse."" And I said, why the hell didnât he tell me that before I put him in? How do you recuse yourself?"
00:18:15 - 00:18:49 (35 sec),"But the person that appointed Robert Mueller never received a vote. Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission. [Laughter] Now, how do you do that? These are angry, angry people. You take a look at them. One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen."
00:18:49 - 00:19:10 (21 sec),"[Laughter] All killers. In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put half and half, and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he'll probably do. But we have conflicts. I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why isnât that mentioned?"
00:19:10 - 00:19:27 (17 sec),"He wanted the job as FBI Director. I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it. Why isnât that -- and I didnât give it to him. Why isnât that mentioned? Jim Comey -- Lyin' James Comey -- [Audience Boos]"
00:19:27 - 00:20:11 (44 sec),"-- is his best friend. James Comey is his best friend. And those are a few of the conflicts. Other than that, it's wonderful. [Laughter] So -- so everybody is waiting. I thought of it this morning, Mark. And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement today. Mark Levin. I heard it was incredible."
00:20:11 - 00:20:38 (27 sec),"And I was on the way. But I'll see it later. I guarantee I'll be watching it later. I have one of the great inventions in history. It's called TiVo. [Laughter] I think it's actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right? [Laughter] But I'll be watching it later, Mark."
00:20:38 - 00:21:03 (25 sec),"But people that got no votes. But I heard this morning, ""President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report."" I said, wait a minute, let me get this straight. [Laughter] So the Attorney General recuses himself, and I donât fire him. No obstruction. That's the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it's called obstruction."
00:21:03 - 00:21:31 (28 sec),"But only for Trump. For nobody else. [Laughter] So the Attorney General is weak and ineffective, and he doesnât do what he should've done. Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter -- horrible -- about Comey. Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired, or worse, if possible. [Laughter] Every Republican said -- everybody -- in fact, when I fired Comey, I said, ""You know..."" -- First Lady -- I said, ""Melania, I'm doing something today."
00:21:31 - 00:21:59 (29 sec),"I'm doing it because it really has to be done."" He's bad. He's a bad, bad -- he's a bad, bad guy. That's been proven now with all of the emails and the texts. ""I'm doing something that has to be done. But you know the good news? It's going to be bipartisan. It's going to be so popular, it's going to be bipartisan."" [Laughter] Every Democrat hates him."
00:21:59 - 00:22:30 (30 sec),"Every Republican hates him. He did a horrible job at the FBI. Speak to the real agents, the real people. Because the people in the FBI are incredible people -- not the sleaze on top. And I said to the First Lady -- I said, ""But you know the good news? The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan."
00:22:30 - 00:22:56 (27 sec),"Everyone is going to love it."" So we fire Comey. And Schumer -- who called for his resignation many times -- Podesta, I believe that day -- because he still hasnât gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay? I believe that day called for his resignation. That day. Podesta, the great genius of campaigns."
00:22:56 - 00:23:27 (31 sec),"[Laughter] He called for the Comey resignation. Others -- almost every, I would say. Mark, would you say virtually every Democrat, virtually every -- I can't think of anybody that said he's doing a good job. So I said to Melania, ""Melania, the good news, this will be a popular thing."" [Laughter] And I fire a bad cop."
00:23:27 - 00:23:54 (27 sec),"I fire a dirty cop. And all of a sudden, the Democrats say, ""How dare he fire him. How dare he do this."" And that's where we are, folks. That's where we are. We're in this swamp of Washington, D.C. But you know what? We're winning, and they're not. We're winning. So, just to finish -- and I'll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this."
00:23:54 - 00:24:18 (23 sec),"[Laughter] He's saying, ""This is a lot more than we paid for."" You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, ""Bye, folks."" But you know what I like about this? Number one, I'm in love, and you're in love. We're all in love together. We've done something that nobody has ever done. Right?"
00:24:18 - 00:24:40 (22 sec),"It's easy. No, it's easy. You know, a great friend of mine from New York, he's a stone-cold killer. He's a brutal man. He's actually not even a good friend of mine because he'd turn on me in two seconds if it was [Inaudible]. [Laughter] But he's a very rich guy. And he said, ""What are you going to speak about today?"
00:24:40 - 00:25:08 (27 sec),"Like, what are you going to speak?"" I said, ""I don't know. I don't know."" [Laughter] He said, ""I just heard that you have the biggest crowd in the history of CPAC. They're all over. By the way, not only in this giant room. They're in many hotel rooms all over the place. You're just better at real estate than they are."" [Laughter] True."
00:25:08 - 00:25:54 (46 sec),"But this guy -- you all know his name -- very rich guy. And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking. If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes. [Laughter] He can't breathe. You know, juh-juh. ""Are you okay?"" He kills people for a living -- meaning mentally and financially -- but if there's like an audience of nine, it's like ""augh."" [Laughter] So he said to me, ""How the hell do you do that?"" And I said, ""It's easy."" And the reason it's easy -- I really mean this -- there's so much love in this room, it's easy to talk."
00:25:54 - 00:26:28 (34 sec),You can talk your heart out. You really could. There's love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. And we've had that from the day I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in Trump Tower. It's been easy. And you know what? We never had an empty seat.
00:26:28 - 00:26:59 (31 sec),"We went out and helped Ted Cruz. We went out and helped so many people. And I'll tell you what: If we didnât do those 32 rallies -- and it wasnât easy. When you're doing rallies with 25-, 30,000 people -- in Texas, we had 109,000 people sign up. We used the Houston Rockets arena; it holds 22,000. Tens of thousands were outside."
00:26:59 - 00:27:34 (35 sec),"We were sending notices, ""Please donât come."" That's a little different. Usually, people are begging. ""Well, yeah, like can somebody come?"" [Laughter] We never had an empty seat. Of course, the Washington Post -- a guy named David Weigel -- he wrote an article, some arena -- [Audience Boos]"
00:27:34 - 00:28:30 (56 sec),"No, listen to this. He wrote an article. He got there four hours early. He took pictures of an empty arena. He then put out a note -- something to the effect, ""Not very good crowd size, Mr. President."" And I never saw it because I donât follow the guy. But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that couldnât get in -- he got there four or five hours early because he doesnât fly private."
00:28:30 - 00:28:49 (19 sec),"You know. [Laughter] And maybe it's because of the carbon footprint. You think maybe that's it? [Laughter] Maybe. Must be the carbon footprint. He just doesnât want private. But he got there hours early. And, you know, the place hadnât started taking in people. They werenât going to take them in. So there were virtually nobody."
00:28:49 - 00:29:11 (22 sec),"And, you know, whatever it was -- 18,000 -- when you have nobody, it's a little scary-looking. So he took pictures. And you know who really got even? Our people. Because they were incensed. We had people sitting on the stairwells. We had people sitting in every seat. I donât think we've had an empty seat since we announced."
00:29:11 - 00:29:31 (19 sec),"And from the day we came down the escalator, I really donât believe we've had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium. It's been an incredible thing. And that's why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in 2020 with an even bigger victory. [Applause, Audience chants Four More Years]"
00:29:31 - 00:29:53 (22 sec),"And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great Sarah Huckabee and Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here -- Mercedes, thank you. They always say -- you know, they're good people, right? Much better than I am. They always say, ""Don't bring it up. Donât fight. Donât fight."
00:29:53 - 00:30:22 (29 sec),"Everyone understands."" I said, ""They donât understand."" If I donât explain it, how are they going to understand? So remember the arena one, right? And then it was shown. And the Washington Post had to do -- and this particular writer -- had to do a -- I thought he was going to get fired. I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot."
00:30:22 - 00:31:09 (47 sec),"He would've been humiliated for what he did. Because it was fake news. Nobody was in the arena. There were thousands outside but they hadnât opened the gates yet. They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean -- how horrible."
00:31:09 - 00:31:30 (21 sec),And I watched it by mistake. [Laughter] And they showed -- they showed from the White House all the way down. They showed from the Cap- -- they showed -- there were people. Nobody has ever seen it. The Capitol down to the Washington Monument -- people. But I saw pictures that there were no people. [Laughter] Those pictures were taken hours before.
00:31:30 - 00:32:02 (32 sec),"Right? And they always mention crowd size. ""He talks about crowd size."" So I'm constantly bugging Mercedes. Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, ""Mercedes"" -- and Sarah -- ""show them the pictures. Show them. And compare them with what they put on television. Those pictures were taken hours before."" And remember this also -- not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument."
00:32:02 - 00:32:27 (25 sec),"And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet. And women and men -- and I consider them totally equal, so I'm not going to say it's harder. [Laughter] In fact, it's probably, with the men I know, it's actually easier for the women to make the walk, right? [Audience Calls Out No]"
00:32:27 - 00:32:52 (25 sec),"But they had to walk all the way down. They had to walk with high heels, in many cases. They had to walk all the way down to the Washington Monument and then back. And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on -- I said to the people that were sitting next to me, ""I've never seen anything like this."
00:32:52 - 00:33:18 (26 sec),"Look at that crowd."" And it was wide. Wide. We had a crowd -- I've never seen anything like it. And I have to live -- I have to live with ""crowd size."" It's all a phony deal. But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken hours before our great day. That was a great day for us. That was a great, great day."
00:33:18 - 00:33:48 (30 sec),"People came from all over. People came from all over. So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, ""Sir, it doesnât matter. Nobody cares."" I said, ""But I care."" [Laughter] And people care. People care. So what I'm going to do is I'll give it to the great one. I'll give it to Mark Levin. And I'll give him the picture."
00:33:48 - 00:34:21 (34 sec),"Then I'll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field -- like nobody on it. And you'll see the sun. You know, you can see it's very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right? [Laughter] And you can have some fun. You're going to get big ratings on your show, I'll tell you that."
00:34:21 - 00:34:56 (34 sec),"Sunday night, everybody. Sunday night. Huh? Ten o'clock, right? Sunday night at 10 o'clock. [Audience Member Calls Out, Trump laughs] Thank you. I knew that, actually. But thank you. All right, now let's get back to what I'm here for. [Laughter] And don't fall asleep. Donât fall asleep, right? Donât fall asleep. You know, somebody said, ""Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible."" They said it was incredible."
00:34:56 - 00:35:30 (35 sec),"They said that was so great. And I said -- I said -- I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there. [Laughter] Of course, by the following morning, they had to change because the head people called up, ""What are you doing?"" [Laughter] A lot of it is not the people on television, you know."
00:35:30 - 00:35:51 (20 sec),"A lot of it is their bosses -- which someday we're going to have to figure out why, Meadows, why that is. Because, you know, if you're building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we've ever had. More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country."
00:35:51 - 00:36:19 (28 sec),"And you say, why are they upset by that? Why? Why are they upset by that? We've slashed 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record in the history of the United States, even by Presidents there for eight years, and in one case more. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history."
00:36:19 - 00:36:46 (28 sec),"And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal. Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare. It should. The great state of Texas has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate. Now that it's gone, I don't know how they rule against it. Now we'll have to find out."
00:36:46 - 00:37:14 (27 sec),"But that'll soon be up in the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope. And we're going to see what happens. And then we're going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay? Really great healthcare. And of the other things we did in our tax package is ANWR. Perhaps the largest field in the world -- oil and gas."
00:37:14 - 00:37:40 (26 sec),"I got it approved. And I didnât want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Donât get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I donât want to get it. Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he's in the oil business."
00:37:40 - 00:38:16 (36 sec),"He's not asking for anything. He said -- but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas. He said to me, ""Hey"" -- and they all call me ""Mr. President."" I have friends that, for 35 years, ""Hey, Don, how you doing? Hey, Donny. I love you, Donny."" For 35 years. Now they call, ""Mr. President, sir."" [Laughter] ""How are you?"" I have a friend -- a very rich guy -- Richard LeFrak, in New York."
00:38:16 - 00:38:45 (29 sec),"A builder. A good builder. He calls me all my life, ""Hey, Don, how you doing?"" I've known this guy so long -- from kindergarten. [Laughter] It's true. ""Hi, Don, how you doing? How's everything?"" And now I get a call the other day, ""Mr. President, how are you, sir? How are you?"" I said, ""Richard, lighten up. Lighten up."" [Laughter] ""Call me 'Donald'."" ""Richard, call me 'Donald'."" You've known me for -- I donât want to say, because I donât want my wife to hear the number."" [Laughter] But -- it's true."
00:38:45 - 00:39:18 (32 sec),"Actually, that's true. That's actually true. Richard came up; he said, ""I've known your husband for 65 years."" I said, ""Donât say that."" [Laughter] I say, ""Say 25, 30. Donât say 65 years."" But I said, ""Richard -- Richard, call me 'Donald', like you always do. Call me 'Don'."" ""Okay."" ""Okay, Don. Okay."" He gets his breath."
00:39:18 - 00:40:04 (46 sec),"Uh-huh. Two minutes later -- ""Mr. President..."" [Laughter] That's called respect for the office, right? Maybe that's a good thing, right? Many -- many of my friends. And that wasnât in the script either, Mark. [Laughter] But we're renegotiating, right now, horrible trade deals that we're cracking down -- and we are really doing a number -- cracking down on countries that cheat, and standing up for the American worker for the first time in many, many decades."
00:40:04 - 00:40:29 (25 sec),Many decades. Our workers have been treated horribly. A country announces they're closing their plant in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Ohio -- they're closing. They're closing a plant; they're going to move to Mexico. They're going to move to China. They're going to move someplace else. They fire all their workers.
00:40:29 - 00:40:58 (29 sec),"And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in Mexico, sell them back to here. No tax, no nothing. Those days are all gone, folks. They're all gone. They're all gone. And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it's very, very hard -- prohibitively hard -- for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location."
00:40:58 - 00:41:19 (21 sec),"It's now a very costly -- they can do it, I guess, if they want. But it's costly. It's painful. It used to be almost -- I said -- I used to -- I've been talking about this for a long time. I used to say it's almost like we're giving them an incentive to leave our country. Again, I'm for America first. That wasnât for America first."
00:41:19 - 00:41:35 (16 sec),"And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country. They're coming back in. They're coming back in. And, by the way, you know I'm building the wall. We're finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It's in the thing. [Audience chants Build that Wall]"
00:41:35 - 00:42:25 (50 sec),But -- and there will be some people in the room that donât like this. We're down to 3.7 percent unemployment -- the lowest number in a long time. But think of this: I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place.
00:42:25 - 00:42:40 (15 sec),"This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we've been. Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in. We need workers to come in, but they've got to come in legally, and they've got to come in through merit, merit, merit. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:42:40 - 00:43:09 (29 sec),"They've got to come in through merit. They have to be people that can help us. They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country. We have people in Congress -- right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country. [Audience Boos]"
00:43:09 - 00:43:33 (24 sec),"And you know that. And we can name every one of them if they want. They hate our country. It's sad. It's very sad. When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it's very, very sad. Very, very -- and find out, how did they do in their country? Just ask them, how did they do? Did they do well?"
00:43:33 - 00:44:09 (36 sec),"Were they succeeding? Just ask that question. Somebody would say, ""Oh, that's terrible that he brings that up."" But that's okay, I donât mind. I'll bring it up. [Laughter] How did they do in their country? Not so good. Not so good. But we need workers. We have to bring in workers. One other thing -- because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes."
00:44:09 - 00:44:32 (23 sec),"We have some senators. We have some congressmen. When a senator tells us that he's a free trader, so am I. I'm a fair trader. I'm a free trader. But when a senator said we can't do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we're able to use this tremendous power that I found -- tremendous -- old stuff."
00:44:32 - 00:45:00 (28 sec),"Nobody even knew it existed. I'm able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals. They wouldn't even be talking to us because it's so one-sided. Last year, we lost eight hundred -- this for many years -- almost $800 billion on trade. It's not sustainable. You can't do that. And now we're making great trade deals."
00:45:00 - 00:45:28 (28 sec),"But when some of the senators -- good people; I think they're good people. I just don't understand the thinking. So I say, India is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot. When we send a motorcycle to India, it's 100 percent tariff. They charge 100 percent. When India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing."
00:45:28 - 00:45:53 (24 sec),"So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax. It's called a mirror tax, but it's a reciprocal tax. Now, here's what I don't understand: I've had a lot of people -- Lindsey Graham. I said, Lindsey -- it's not his thing necessarily. It's not the thing that he's most adept at. But he's adept and he's smart."
00:45:53 - 00:46:14 (21 sec),"I said, ""Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci-..."" If they charge us, we charge them. He goes, ""That makes sense to me."" [Laughter] And then he gets on to judiciary and things that, frankly, he likes and finds very interesting. But he's a smart guy, and he said -- I'll never forget. It took me about a minute, which is a long time."
00:46:14 - 00:46:34 (21 sec),"I did a bad description. It's so easy. They charge 100; we charge nothing. Now we have reciprocal, so it's 100. But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and don't like tariffs for whatever reason might be -- and that's okay. What's going to happen is, in many cases, instead of 100 and 100, you're going to have zero and zero, so you won't have any tariff."
00:46:34 - 00:46:56 (21 sec),"Okay? It's going to happen. That's going to happen. But you have to -- you have to start working on some of the senators that say ""I can't approve this deal."" I say, ""You know what? I want to just charge India"" -- as an example, I'm using it. But India is a very high-tariff nation. I mean, nobody -- nobody knows it because nobody knows what they're doing in Washington."
00:46:56 - 00:47:20 (24 sec),"[Laughter] But India is a very, very high-tariff nation, and they charge tremendous -- tremendous numbers. So they charge 100. So I say, ""I'm not going to charge 100, but I'm going to charge 25 percent."" And I hear this turmoil in the Senate because we're charging 25. So I call a couple of the guys up. I say, ""Fellas, listen, they're charging us 100 for the exact same product."
00:47:20 - 00:47:45 (25 sec),"I want to charge them 25."" And I feel so foolish charging 25 because it should be 100. ""But I'm doing 25 only because of you. I want to get your support."" ""Sir, that's not free trade."" Where do these people come from? [Laughter] Where do they come from? Where? Where do they come from? I need your help. I need your help -- the voters' help."
00:47:45 - 00:48:17 (32 sec),"Where do they come from? So it can only be one of two or three things. Number one, I know they're very smart people. I know they are. And I even like some of them. [Laughter] But they're smart. So we take that out of the equation. So even -- and I know they don't have evil intentions. And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe -- you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous."
00:48:17 - 00:48:49 (32 sec),"Campaign contributions -- they're very, very generous people. Can that be possible? I don't think so. I hope not. Because we're talking about our country. We can't allow a country to charge 100 percent and we get nothing for the same exact product. For one thing, they don't respect us. They think we're ""stupido."" They don't respect us. [Laughter] But let me tell you something: The world respects our country again."
00:48:49 - 00:49:39 (50 sec),"They respect us. And America is now booming like never before. Other countries are doing very poorly. Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful. Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the Fed. We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed. We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the Fed. So with all of those things -- and we want a strong dollar, but let's be reasonable."
00:49:39 - 00:50:00 (21 sec),"You understand that. With all of that, we're doing great. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? There's no inflation, essentially. There's no inflation. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? If we didn't do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market?"
00:50:00 - 00:50:38 (38 sec),"If we didn't do quantitative -- and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar. A little bit. I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's going to be great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business. Since the election, we've created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy."
00:50:38 - 00:51:20 (42 sec),"5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country. These are jobs that were never coming back to our country. Remember? Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked Hillary winning the election, instead of being up almost 50 percent with the stock market, you would have been down 50 percent."
00:51:20 - 00:52:00 (40 sec),"It was heading down. It was going to be a disaster. We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps. Nobody ever thought that was possible. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years. And African American -- and you've heard me say this many times -- Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows."
00:52:00 - 00:52:41 (41 sec),"And African American income has reached an all-time high. So when I'm on the debate stage with one of these maniacs -- [Laughter] -- I mean, trains to Hawaii. ""How do you get to Europe?"" ""We haven't figured that one out yet. We don't use airplanes anymore."" [Laughter] You saw what I'm doing in California, right?"
00:52:41 - 00:53:03 (22 sec),"They have a fast train. The fast train goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It's over budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, so they have a great idea -- the new governor; nice guy. Yeah, he's a nice guy. When I'm with him face to face, nice. When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me. [Laughter] He called me up. He said, ""You're a great President."
00:53:03 - 00:53:30 (27 sec),"You're doing a great job."" He actually did, two weeks ago, three weeks. So he'll probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House. Everybody else does. [Laughter] Check them. Check them. Check them. Called me up three or four weeks ago. I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that's one of the problems they have."
00:53:30 - 00:53:47 (17 sec),"I said, ""You got to get those forests."" We can't keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly. Got to clean it up. It's called management. When a tree falls, you can't let the environmentalist say you can't take that tree out. It becomes like a matchstick, that tree."
00:53:47 - 00:54:16 (29 sec),"It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves -- every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so -- a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it. The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed. You got to have management. But he called me up the other day, recently -- let's say four weeks ago or so. He said, ""I just want to tell you you're a great President and you're one of the smartest people I've ever met."" That's what he said."
00:54:16 - 00:54:35 (19 sec),"Now, that's what he said. Will he admit it? No, I doubt it. [Laughter] But that's what he said. ""And you're doing a great job."" And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is -- [Laughter] -- it's okay. That's okay. We have great talks. I mean, I like him. Gavin Newsom."
00:54:35 - 00:55:02 (27 sec),"I like him. Nice guy. But they say things -- you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see two days later they're giving a news conference -- just like, where did that guy come from? Where did he come from? But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well -- except, of course, for the Never Trumpers."
00:55:02 - 00:55:43 (41 sec),"But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. [Laughter] Mouth to mouth. Mouth to mouth. They're hanging in. A couple of them. I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong. Not only Never Trumpers. You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline. They're basically dishonest people -- because, look, let's face it: Whether you like me or not -- if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges -- it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges."
00:55:43 - 00:56:19 (36 sec),"And 17 appellate division judges. That we've got the best economy maybe in our history. That we've got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history. That we've cut more regulations in two years than any President has ever done, whether it's for eight or beyond. That we've taken care of our military with -- $1.7 billion."
00:56:19 - 00:56:39 (20 sec),"Think of that. Think of what we did. Think of what we did with our military. Think of the numbers that we have for our military. We have numbers -- nobody has ever heard of these numbers before. And you know, part of the problem that we have -- because I'm a cost cutter. But -- and you are all cost cutters."
00:56:39 - 00:57:07 (28 sec),"But we have to take care of our military. We have to. Seven hundred billions dollars we spent. And that was the first year. And then the second year, $716 billion. Now, I have no choice. I'd like to spend much less. Obama was spending much less but our military was being depleted. He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end."
00:57:07 - 00:57:33 (26 sec),"And, by the way, as of probably today or tomorrow, we will actually have 100 percent of the caliphate in Syria. One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And we'll leave a small group of guys and gals. But we want to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. It's time."
00:57:33 - 00:58:24 (51 sec),"Been in these wars. We were going to be in Syria for four months. We ended up five years. This fighting -- they just like to fight. We want to fix our country. We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools. We want to fix our country up. It's time. It's time. But I was told by a general, who I had to fire -- I said, ""General, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate?"" He said, ""Sir, two years."" I said, ""I can't take it two years."" And then I flew to Iraq; first time I left the White House -- because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places."
00:58:24 - 00:58:40 (16 sec),"[Laughter] And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay? I figured it would look good. [Laughter] I figured it would look good. So I stayed in the White House. And I'll tell you what: I was there -- I told my wife, ""Go to Florida."
00:58:40 - 00:59:01 (21 sec),"Enjoy your Christmas."" I stayed for Thanksgiving. I said -- I mean, I was in the White House for a long time. Months. Months. I had cabin fever in the White House. [Laughter] But if you've got to have cabin fever, that's the place to do it, okay? [Laughter] But I was there, I don't know, for a number of months, through Christmas."
00:59:01 - 00:59:05 (4 sec),"I spent my New Year's all by myself. [Laughter, Audience calls out Awww]"
00:59:05 - 00:59:35 (29 sec),"Don't cry. All -- it was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns. [Laughter] I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns. I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, ""Man..."" They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn. I told people, ""I'm in this mess"" -- you know, people don't know how big the White House."
00:59:35 - 00:59:54 (20 sec),"First of all, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world. It's really -- I made a lot of money with luxury. This building is -- 1799 -- which, of course, when President Xi comes, I say ""1799,"" like it's old. To him, that's like a brand-new house in China. [Laughter] In China, they go back -- they go back 8,000 years."
00:59:54 - 01:00:29 (35 sec),"So that's -- that's like a new -- that's like a new residence. But I sat in the White House for months and months, except I took a day off. I flew to a lovely place called Iraq, and I flew at night and I got there at night. And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, ""Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off."" I say, ""Why?"" [Laughter] ""Because we're getting ready to land."" We're an hour out."
01:00:29 - 01:00:46 (18 sec),"I said, ""What about the shades?"" ""Well, we want it better than that. May be like [Inaudible]. So we turned the lights off, put the shades down. This is a big seven forty -- Air Force One. And we're landing, and I go up and I look. And I've landed; I like to sit with pilots. I respect people that know what they're doing, and these are the best in the world."
01:00:46 - 01:01:11 (25 sec),"I really do. These are the best in the world. And the pilot says, ""Sir, we're landing in approximately one and a half minutes."" I say, ""But there's no runway."" ""No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir."" I say, ""I don't see it."" I have pretty good vision. [Laughter] At least for my age I have good vision."
01:01:11 - 01:01:30 (19 sec),"[Laughter] I guess for my age I have great vision. But I donât have vision like a 35-year-old captain. He said, ""No, it's right up there."" I said, ""I'm sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again? Captain, there's no runway."" Anyway -- he sits right up there and we land. There's practically not lights."
01:01:30 - 01:02:00 (29 sec),"These are little pin spots. And I said, think of this: We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we can't land with the lights on -- [Laughter] -- 20 years later. How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights. But I met some incredible people."
01:02:00 - 01:02:24 (24 sec),I met some incredible people -- generals. One of them came from Syria -- the operation in Syria. And I was upset with my generals because they weren't getting it finished. I want the job done. I want to bring our people back home. It's not fair. And this is why I flew. So I met generals I didn't know.
01:02:24 - 01:02:48 (24 sec),"General one, general two, general three. I mean, these generals -- there's no person in Hollywood that could play the role. These guys are like perfect people. I said, ""What's your name? ""Sir, my name is Raisin."" What the hell kind of a name? [Laughter] I said, ""Raisin, like the fruit?"" He goes, ""Yes, sir, Raisin."" ""What's your last name?"" ""Caine."
01:02:48 - 01:03:12 (24 sec),"Raisin Caine."" [Laughter] I said, ""You got to be kidding me."" It's true. Raisin Caine. I just made him a big star. [Laughter] Just like I did with Mattis when I said, ""We're going to give you a new nickname, because 'Chaos' is not a good nickname."" So we changed his name. Called him ""Mad Dog."" But it wasnât working too well."
01:03:12 - 01:03:28 (16 sec),"Mad Dog wasn't working too well. So what happened is I flew to Iraq. I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what's going on, than I do from generals. I do. I hate to say it. And I tell that to the generals all the time. But I didn't have to go there."
01:03:28 - 01:03:47 (19 sec),"I didn't have to go there. Because I meet -- and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing. We must have spent $3 billion building it. It's one of the reasons I don't want to leave Iraq so fast. I said, ""Well, how do we leave this thing?"" So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants."
01:03:47 - 01:04:10 (23 sec),"And I said, ""Bring the cameras. I'm going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing."" [Laughter] And I said to the generals, ""Listen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left."" ""It won't, sir."" And I said, ""Tell me why it won't."" ""It won't, sir."
01:04:10 - 01:04:49 (39 sec),"If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster."" ""Okay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can"" -- ""Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week."" I said, ""One week? I was told two years."" [Laughter] One week? ""That's right, sir. We're only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over -- from the base that you're right on, right now, sir."
01:04:49 - 01:05:08 (19 sec),"They won't know what the hell hit them."" ""They won't know what the hell hit them, sir."" And I said, ""Why didn't my other generals tell me that? Why didn't they tell me that?"" I said, ""Did you tell them that?"" ""Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders."
01:05:08 - 01:05:36 (28 sec),"You're the first one to ask us our opinion."" It's true. It's true. True. True. So I went back and I said, ""I'm going to get back to you soon, Raisin. I think you're great."" [Laughter] ""I like you, Raisin Caine."" But I did say -- I said, ""Well, hey, listen, we're in Iraq. Isn't that very far away from..."" ""I was here in a very short time, sir."
01:05:36 - 01:06:00 (24 sec),"I flew right in."" Of course, he's taking a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, you know. But incredible. What you learn from being on the site -- my father was a builder. He always used to say, ""Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk."" It's true. It's true. He'd say, ""You got to be on this site."
01:06:00 - 01:06:18 (18 sec),"You got to be with the contractors. You got to see if they're ripping you off. You've got to collect every nail that's dropped, every piece of wood. You can sell it. You got to be on the site. You got to see while they're building, while they're under construction, is that wall straight or if it's crooked."
01:06:18 - 01:06:40 (22 sec),"And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down."" True. You donât get rich by sitting behind a desk. So I didn't want to do that. And I'm in the White House and I was lonely. I said, ""Let's go to Iraq."" [Laughter] And I had a hell of a meeting in Iraq."
01:06:40 - 01:07:09 (29 sec),"And I'll tell you, those generals -- not just Raisin Caine, General Caine. Those generals were great. They were great. They knew their stuff. They were gung-ho. And it is true -- I mean, you talk central casting. These guys -- you couldnât -- I mean, it's incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he's the star of the movie."
01:07:09 - 01:07:38 (29 sec),"That happened once before, you know. That did happen once before. Remember? They brought a man in -- a sergeant, a drill sergeant -- to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant. The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn't. That's because Hollywood discriminates against our people."
01:07:38 - 01:08:12 (34 sec),"You know the movie I'm talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie. But while we're making great strides, and our country is doing as well -- and maybe, in many ways, better than it's ever done before -- Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism. They want to replace individual rights with total government domination. [Audience Boos]"
01:08:12 - 01:08:35 (23 sec),"Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American healthcare. Their radical government-run plan -- if you call it that -- would lead to colossal tax increases -- increases like you've never seen before -- and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans. [Audience calls out No]"
01:08:35 - 01:09:16 (41 sec),"And we have some great private coverage, and we've initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost. But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal. [Audience Boos]"
01:09:16 - 01:09:55 (39 sec),"Under the Green New Deal -- which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student -- [Laughter] -- it's true. It's true. Who would believe it? It so -- it's so bad. But I don't -- I'll be honest with you, folks. I said -- you know, it's Saturday morning, and I said, ""Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time?"" He said, ""Yeah, would you do that?"" By the way, everybody okay?"
01:09:55 - 01:10:20 (25 sec),"I haven't seen anybody leaving. I haven't seen anybody. I know one thing: If Mark Levin gets up and leaves, I'll finish very quickly, because then I know. [Laughter] But I haven't seen anyone leaving. Nobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times -- a lot of times -- well, one time, the press said people left."
01:10:20 - 01:10:46 (27 sec),"Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back. [Laughter] Two people. They showed two empty seats in a stadium of 19,000. They showed two empty seats. The people left right in front of me, and I said, ""Oh, man, maybe this isn't a good job I'm doing."" Then they came back."
01:10:46 - 01:11:15 (28 sec),"They went to the bathroom. [Laughter] And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats. The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we're now the leader in the world."
01:11:15 - 01:11:40 (26 sec),"We're the biggest now in the world because of moves that I've made. Happened over the last two years, by the way. And we're trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years. We think we're almost very close to getting them approved. When that happens, we'll go probably another 30 to 40 percent."
01:11:40 - 01:12:13 (33 sec),"We need pipeline approval. We're going to have it very quickly. It would have taken -- it was going to be a 14- to 15-year process. We should have it done. We'll pick up 30 to 40 percent more. Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads. Oh, that's not so bad. They want you to have one car instead of two, and it should be electric, okay?"
01:12:13 - 01:12:35 (22 sec),"So tell people, no more cars. No more cars. I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan. What do you think, Meadows? How is this? Will the auto industry be good? I donât think so. It's not looking good. I think maybe -- maybe you're going to see some bad stock prices if that passes."
01:12:35 - 01:13:01 (26 sec),"It would end air travel. But you'll get on a train, don't worry about it. You just have to cross off about 95 percent of the world. And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States. New York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again."
01:13:01 - 01:13:27 (26 sec),"I don't think so. This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for 20 years -- white hair. See, I don't have white hair. [Laughter] I donât have white hair. No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she's ranting and raving like a lunatic. [Laughter]"
01:13:27 - 01:14:01 (35 sec),"And these senators -- these senators: ""Yes, I agree with this. Yes, I agree."" The crazy female senator from the state of Ohio, the state of Hawaii. Right? She's like -- she's like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad. But she's standing in the hallway."
01:14:01 - 01:14:39 (38 sec),"And she didn't know too much about the plan because she's -- you know, she can't understand that plan. [Laughter] Which probably makes her smart, actually. Now, this is the senator from Hawaii, and they're saying to her, ""What do you think? Well, I don't know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I'm in favor of the plan."" [Laughter] I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. So she's in favor of the plan, but you won't be able to get to -- well, we can take boats, I guess."
01:14:39 - 01:15:10 (30 sec),We'll go back to boats. This is the new Democrat platform for the -- and I don't want to talk them out of it. I don't. I don't. I swear I don't. This is a killer. I got to get off this subject. I want them to embrace this plan. I want them to go and sell this plan. I just want to be the Republican that runs against them for that.
01:15:10 - 01:15:40 (30 sec),"I'm going to regret this speech. This speech should have been delivered one year from now, not now, damn it. [Laughter] Because they're going to grab out together, and they're going to say, ""You know, this guy is really laying for us."" I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year. [Laughter] Because I've destroyed her political career, and now I won't get a chance to run against her, and I wouldâve loved it. [Laughter] We got to -- you know, I don't want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that's actually got talent."
01:15:40 - 01:15:58 (19 sec),That would be terrible. [Laughter] So I do like the Green New Deal. [Laughter] I respect it greatly. It should be part of the dialogue of the next election. [Laughter] And I think it has tremendous promise and tremendous potential for the future of our country. Socialism is not about the environment.
01:15:58 - 01:16:17 (19 sec),"It's not about justice. It's not about virtue. Socialism is about only one thing. It's called ""power for the ruling class."" That's what it is. Look at what's happening in Venezuela and so many other places. All of us are here today because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism."
01:16:17 - 01:16:57 (40 sec),"And I heard, yesterday, a great speech from our Vice President Mike Pence, talking about this very subject -- and talking about it beautifully. The future belongs to those who believe in freedom. I have said it before and I'll say it again: America will never be a socialist country -- ever."
01:16:57 - 01:16:57 (0 sec),[Audience Chants USA]
01:16:57 - 01:17:09 (12 sec),"Young Americans -- I love young Americans. Speaking of young Americans -- Candace, stand up. Candace is getting married. Stand up. You've been incredible. Thank you. Your whole group has been great. You're getting married. Seems like a nice guy to me. [Laughter] Congratulations. You've been so great."
01:17:09 - 01:17:41 (32 sec),"Thank you very much, Candace. Thanks. And, Charlie, what a job you're doing. Where's Charlie? Where's Charlie? Where is Charlie Kirk? Because he has done an incredible job. Thank you very much, Charlie. But young Americans like you are leading the revival of American liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance."
01:17:41 - 01:18:21 (40 sec),"The anger -- the unbelievable anger -- I see it every day. Fortunately, for you, it's mostly pointed at me. [Laughter] You have the courage to speak the truth, to do what is right, and to fight for what you believe, and keep doing it. We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas."
01:18:21 - 01:18:57 (36 sec),"These ideas are dangerous. Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus. And, by the way, there's a young gentleman with us today. There's a young gentleman. I turned on my television the other day, and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face."
01:18:57 - 01:19:36 (39 sec),"Violently punched. And I said that's disgusting. By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things. But, of course, we would never do that. Because if I ever said violence, they would say, ""Donald Trump attacked."" No, no, no. Just for the media: I'm sure he's a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum."
01:19:36 - 01:20:09 (33 sec),"[Laughter] I've been there before with those people. I donât want to do it again. So, the man's name is Hayden Williams. Where's Hayden? Where is he? Where is he? Hayden, come up here. Come up here."
01:20:09 - 01:20:29 (19 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. So, at the Leadership Institute, we're committed to making campuses great again. And I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak. It's great -- it's great that I'm being recognized, and -- but there's so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse, if they dare to speak up on campus."
01:20:29 - 01:20:58 (29 sec),"So I'm glad that we could -- we could, you know, bring this to the forefront. And I'd just like to say, you know, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat. So, you know, it's as important now than ever the work at Leadership Institute and Campus Reform -- you know, exposing these liberal abuses to the public -- it's as important now as ever."
01:20:58 - 01:21:10 (12 sec),"And these students -- these students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom, and frankly, a love for you, Mr. President. So if you keep defending us, we'll keep defending you."
01:21:10 - 01:21:16 (5 sec),Thank you.
01:21:16 - 01:21:16 (1 sec),Thank you.
01:21:16 - 01:21:35 (19 sec),"Stay here for a second. So, here's the one thing. I was going to call him, but I don't have to now. I see him here. But here's the one thing: I learned a number of things. First of all, he can take a punch. If Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take a punch. [Laughter] Because you werenât going to go down no matter how -- that was a hell of a hard punch."
01:21:35 - 01:22:11 (36 sec),"He was a strong guy. But you know what? You've got yourself a great lawyer. I know your lawyer. She is a great lawyer. Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him. But he's probably got nothing, but sue him forever. But sue the college, the university. And maybe sue the state. Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us. Remember that."
01:22:11 - 01:22:52 (41 sec),"He took a punch for all of us. And we can never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden -- here's the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man. That's okay. [Laughter] Go get 'em, Hayden. Today I'm proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech -- if they want federal research dollars. [Audience Chants USA]"
01:22:52 - 01:23:57 (65 sec),"If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people, and old people, to speak. Free speech. And if they don't, it will be very costly. That'll be signed very soon. Every day, we're restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all."
01:23:57 - 01:24:22 (25 sec),"We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right. And we believe in religious liberty. And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms -- which is under siege, folks. They have a lot of plans. It's under siege."
01:24:22 - 01:25:17 (55 sec),"Be careful. But I'll protect you, I promise you that. I'll protect you. Because it all has to come through my office. And we hopefully are going to be here for six more years, so you're in good shape. We believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare. And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust."
01:25:17 - 01:25:59 (42 sec),"Every day, my presidency will defend American families. We will defend America's workers -- our great, great cherished workers -- that now we're taking care of. They're not losing their jobs. We're creating those jobs. We're not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore. We will defend the American way of life, and we will always defend America's borders."
01:25:59 - 01:26:39 (40 sec),"Because without borders, as I've said many times before, we don't have a country. The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet. Deadly cartels constantly -- daily, hourly -- violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill thousands and thousands of our citizens violently."
01:26:39 - 01:27:10 (30 sec),"What are these people talking about when they talk about the border? ""Keep it open."" Keep what open? Have you been there? Have you seen? I just got back. I've been there many times. I see what's happening. I don't like it. But I have to tell you, our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our law enforcement, the job they do -- and they don't have the backup of a wall, in many cases -- the job they do is incredible."
01:27:10 - 01:27:39 (29 sec),"These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere. When I was there two weeks ago, 26 people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande. Sounds nice, right? The Rio Grande. Rough. Rough stuff. Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing."
01:27:39 - 01:28:07 (28 sec),"And the paper doesn't write about it. The news doesn't write about it. In the last two years alone, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests. Think of what that means. Think of that -- arrests. I'm not talking about people coming in. I'm talking they went out and arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder."
01:28:07 - 01:28:37 (30 sec),"Who the hell wants to do that? Thank God they're doing it because I don't want to do it. It's dangerous. It's hard. But they love our country, and they're tough people, but they love our country. Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders."
01:28:37 - 01:28:55 (19 sec),"These are people that ICE is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we donât want them. We don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years. You want them to pay a price, but we don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years."
01:28:55 - 01:29:23 (27 sec),"And all the nonsense you hear about ""the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have"" -- it's not true, folks. Okay? It's false. It's false propaganda. Right? One recent study from FAIR -- F-A-I-R -- found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents."
01:29:23 - 01:29:45 (23 sec),"Those are the numbers. And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are -- the number is staggering. The number of illegals -- far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population. But you don't hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world."
01:29:45 - 01:30:16 (30 sec),Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there. Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly -- so badly. Incredible people. But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place. The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy.
01:30:16 - 01:30:49 (33 sec),"Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word ""rape."" The press went after me; I couldn't believe it. I said, ""Will it be like this always?"" The answer was yes."
01:30:49 - 01:31:45 (56 sec),"It even got worse. From day one, I mention the word ""rape."" If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what's really happening. That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts. Illegal immigration is not compassionate. It's inhumane, unjust, and cruel. The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that 2,000-mile trek up through Mexico -- and frankly, I wish Mexico would stop them at their northern border, at our -- I wish Mexico would stop them."
01:31:45 - 01:32:09 (24 sec),"Because you know, they have a border. They call it their southern border. It's 2,000 miles down from our southern border. I wish Mexico would stop them. But they have their own difficulties. Frankly, I understand that. We're working along well with them. And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we're doing."
01:32:09 - 01:32:42 (32 sec),"But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border. Think of that. True story, told to me by the Border Patrol. So true and so sad. Think of how evil that is. Think of how bad it is. Those caravans -- you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people."
01:32:42 - 01:33:14 (32 sec),"But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers. You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now. ""And what is it that you want asylum for? Why are you coming to America?"" ""Uh, murder."" She goes, ""What?"" ""Murder."" I mean, what's going on is incredible. And when those caravans are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to -- I've cut it way back."
01:33:14 - 01:33:39 (25 sec),"I've cut it way back. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Do you think they're giving us, as we say, their best and their finest? ""Oh, let's send our best people up to America. Let's have our best people go in the caravan so we can give America our greatest people."" No, no, no, no. They give us some very bad people."
01:33:39 - 01:34:14 (35 sec),"People with big, long crime records. People with tremendous violence in their past. Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers. They want to keep their good people because they're smart. It's so sad to see how stupid we've been. Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago."
01:34:14 - 01:34:50 (36 sec),"Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, last month I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people -- and they're good people -- some senators, mostly -- I tell you, the House has been fantastic."
01:34:50 - 01:35:04 (14 sec),"The House -- you know, backing we've had from the House has really been -- I'm talking about in the last short period of time. There's a lot of spirit in the House, and I think in the Senate too, but we're going to have to see because we have a vote coming up. And a lot of people talk about precedent. Precedent."
01:35:04 - 01:35:28 (24 sec),"That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we don't want. They're going to do that anyway, folks. The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election. That's the best way to stop that. They're going to do it anyway. They'll do it anyway."
01:35:28 - 01:35:53 (25 sec),"I watch -- good people, they're friends of mine, ""We're very concerned with setting precedent."" That's ""precedent"" not ""president."" [Laughter] Precedent. ""We're very concerned about setting precedent."" I'm very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country."
01:35:53 - 01:36:16 (23 sec),"That's what I'm concerned about. And the Democrats, they're going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it won't have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency. Because let me tell you -- they don't like it when I say it -- but we are being invaded. We're being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals."
01:36:16 - 01:36:47 (31 sec),"And we have to stop it. And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit. Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in Belarus, to ensure political stability in Burundi, and to defend the sovereignty of Lebanon."
01:36:47 - 01:37:13 (27 sec),"And you know what? That's okay. In Lebanon -- it's good. Fine. Use it. But we need it right here in our country. We have to use it for our country. Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands. Now we are protecting, finally, our people. You. Our people."
01:37:13 - 01:37:48 (34 sec),"And we are proudly standing with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants. If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border."
01:37:48 - 01:38:16 (28 sec),"We need an immigration policy that helps all Americans thrive, flourish, prosper. We need an immigration policy that's going to be great for our corporations and our great companies. We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens. And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities."
01:38:16 - 01:38:31 (15 sec),"And we want to end catch-and-release. We catch them, we realize they're a criminal, and we have to release them. Think of this: They come onto our land, they put one foot on our land. We now have to take them through a massive court trial. Who does this? Other countries say, ""Get the hell out of here."" We have to take them through court."
01:38:31 - 01:39:08 (37 sec),"So we catch them. We talk to them. If they're criminals, or if they're not, we release them. We say, ""Come back for a hearing in front of a judge."" You know how many judges you need to do this? We have 900,000 people backlogged. That's the good news. The bad news? Nobody shows up. Three percent of the people come back for a trial."
01:39:08 - 01:39:38 (30 sec),"It's insane. Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it. We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery. Every American, no matter where they're born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system. It is such -- you talk about an emergency. Our immigration system is so broken, folks."
01:39:38 - 01:40:07 (29 sec),"It's so broken. It's so sad to see. It's incompetent. It's laughed at all over the world. We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in Mexico. From China. They have a baby on our land. The baby becomes a citizen. ""Welcome to the United States"" for hopefully 90 years. Okay? And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen."
01:40:07 - 01:40:43 (36 sec),"This is like crazy. They used to call it ""anchor babies"" but they don't use that term anymore because it doesn't sound nice. Our laws are so crazy. But one by one, we're finding ways. You know, they call them loopholes. A lot of our laws -- loopholes. Well, I'm finding loopholes to get around the loophole."
01:40:43 - 01:41:17 (34 sec),"Okay? [Laughter] Because our Congress can't act. They can't act. They just can't act. The Democrats in Congress don't want to touch any of it. Visa lottery -- that's where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, ""Oh, here's a wonderful person. Wonderful."" You know, he killed four people."
01:41:17 - 01:41:41 (24 sec),"Here's -- here's another wonderful. [Laughter] And then they get in and we say, ""Gee, that person just came into our country. He just robbed a store and killed somebody."" How is that possible? Because they send us the people they don't want. The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations."
01:41:41 - 01:42:03 (22 sec),"Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute. We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves. We have people coming in. We support them from the day they come in until the day they die. We can't do that as a country."
01:42:03 - 01:42:26 (23 sec),"We can't afford to do that as a country. Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream. But that's going to be good for us in 2020. They're embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion. [Audience Boos]"
01:42:26 - 01:42:56 (30 sec),"Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death. Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I don't think I've ever heard, in Virginia, the governor -- a Democrat -- stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside."
01:42:56 - 01:43:13 (17 sec),"He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he'll talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done. And if they didn't want the child, who is now outside of the womb -- long outside of the womb -- they will execute the baby after birth. [Audience Boos]"
01:43:13 - 01:43:43 (31 sec),"They will execute the baby after birth. And that's one many people have never even heard of or thought about. This is a radical agenda by the Democrats. And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it. By the way, I have to say one thing: They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy."
01:43:43 - 01:44:12 (29 sec),They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to. But -- but -- big but -- they always stick together. And the Republicans don't remember that. Remember that. They always stick together. They vote in blocs. They have 47. We had a tremendous victory. We were given no credit. I can't go and campaign for all of the people in the House.
01:44:12 - 01:44:46 (34 sec),"Too many. And guys like Meadows wins by so many points he doesn't need any help. He doesn't need it. I say, ""Mark, do you need any help?"" ""No, I'm okay."" [Laughter] He'll win by 30, 35. They're okay. These guys -- you know a funny thing? The ones that love Trump, the ones that are really the Trumpers -- like Meadows, Jordan, Gates, so many of them."
01:44:46 - 01:45:06 (20 sec),"I donât want to -- I could just name so many. They're the ones that win with that. I mean, it's like they don't even have an election. It's the ones that sort of -- they're a little shy about embracing what we're all about, they get clobbered. They get clobbered. Take a look. Those are the ones that get clobbered."
01:45:06 - 01:45:31 (26 sec),"But the good news is they're all starting to find that out. Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions. Virtually every Democrat voted against protecting these precious babies. Every one. They vote in groups. And we did have that great victory."
01:45:31 - 01:45:56 (25 sec),"We won for 51. And two that we didn't like got out. They said they retired. They didn't retire. They were retired. They said, ""These two senators have decided to retire."" No, no, no. They retired because they had like very little support. Like how about 5 percent? Any percent. No, we did great."
01:45:56 - 01:46:42 (46 sec),"We had 53 we picked up in the Senate. They were going to win the Senate, remember? And I'll tell you, folks, I worked hard. I did 32 big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals. And the fake news back there, they love to say ""Donald Trump suffered a big defeat."" First of all, we won the Senate, which, frankly, judges -- you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the Senate, far more important."
01:46:42 - 01:47:12 (30 sec),"I really worked hard. But think of it. We won the Senate and we had this, like, tremendous victory. We get no credit at all. Wait until you see what happens. They say, ""Donald Trump suffered a humiliating defeat."" I said, ""I wasn't running."" [Laughter] And one of the commentators -- and I appreciate it -- one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, ""Excuse me, he didn't run."" You know, not all our candidates were exactly great."
01:47:12 - 01:47:38 (26 sec),"Let's face it. You know, you can only do so much. But wait until you see what's happening when I do run. And what they don't say is -- governor of Ohio, great guy. Mike. Mike. Mike was down six. He won by seven with one day. Right? He was down by six. One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech."
01:47:38 - 01:48:01 (23 sec),Jim Jordan was there. Everybody was there. It was a fantastic crowd like this. Like this. And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us. And he ended up winning. He was down by six; he won by seven. One day. Then we have Georgia -- the governor of Georgia. Great guy. Where's Georgia?
01:48:01 - 01:48:25 (25 sec),"Great guy. He was losing in the primary by 10. I got a call from David Perdue and Sonny Perdue -- two great guys. ""Could you endorse him?"" I said, ""Let me check."" And I checked him. He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper. [Laughter] And I said, ""I love this guy."" He's down by 10. He won by 40. Can you believe that?"
01:48:25 - 01:48:46 (21 sec),"I endorsed him, Mark. He won by 40. Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party -- not Democratic. It's Democrat. We have to do that. You know, it sounds prettier when we use ""Democratic."" I even like -- I hate to say in the speech, the ""Democrat Party"" because it doesn't sound good."
01:48:46 - 01:49:11 (25 sec),"But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't. [Laughter] They should change it because it sounds much better. Rhetorically, it's much better. Much better. But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address. I didn't think she was great. But she's their star."
01:49:11 - 01:49:18 (7 sec),"And who showed up? Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and President Obama. [Audience Boos]"
01:49:18 - 01:50:03 (45 sec),"And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard. And all our man had was Trump. [Laughter] And we kicked their ass. True. We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport. It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back. The problem was they gave the press, like these guys -- they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them couldn't see properly."
01:50:03 - 01:50:35 (33 sec),"I was so angry. But we had 55,000 people show up. I said, ""You're going to win the election."" He won the election. He won it fairly easily, against their star. And now David Perdue is going to win for senator in 2020. And then -- and then we had Florida, and many others. And we have a candidate, Ron DeSantis -- a friend."
01:50:35 - 01:50:57 (21 sec),"A friend of many of us in this room. But nobody knew he was running. He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win. He was scheduled to be the next governor of Florida. But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt. He's been a defender of me against these phony charges of Russia."
01:50:57 - 01:51:16 (19 sec),"Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. My wife said, ""You never spoke to anybody from Russia, darling."" I said, ""That's right."" [Laughter] But Ron DeSantis -- I like people that defend me. You know, when people defend me, I defend them. So he came. That's why I like Mark. That's why I like Mark Levin."
01:51:16 - 01:51:41 (26 sec),"And I'm not sure a lot of people like him. He's tough as hell. But I like him. I love him. But then we have Florida. So, Ron DeSantis is at three. Three. He calls up, ""Sir, can I have your endorsement?"" I said, ""Ron, you're at three. Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner -- has 22 million in the bank."
01:51:41 - 01:52:03 (22 sec),"His poll numbers are very good. He's up in the 20s or 30s."" I said, ""Ron, don't make me do this, Ron."" [Laughter] ""Sir, I can win."" ""All right, Ron. Here we go."" Because I know if he loses -- which almost never happens when I endorse somebody. Almost never. Only one time, and that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election."
01:52:03 - 01:52:29 (26 sec),"Nobody knew I did it. They got home, they said, ""I didn't know Trump endorsed him."" But we rarely, rarely lose. But I said, ""Ron, don't do it."" I said, ""All right, I'll do it."" He went from 3 to 60. To 60. And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support. He had every celebrity go into Florida."
01:52:29 - 01:52:55 (26 sec),"He had money all over the place. And Ron was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him. And we now have a great governor in the state of Florida. And I could mention many others -- other governors, many other states. But I'm not going to bore you with it. And I think -- I really think that it's incredible what we did in the midterms."
01:52:55 - 01:53:20 (26 sec),"I think it's incredible. Governor of Florida. Governor of Ohio. Remember, ""You can't win unless you win the state of Ohio."" We got the governor of Ohio, and he's great. Mike. We love you, Mike. As we defend American values at home, we are also defending. American security abroad. We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything."
01:53:20 - 01:53:46 (26 sec),"And we will never forget our military. We will never forget our veterans. We are taking care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor. Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks."
01:53:46 - 01:54:17 (31 sec),And we got them Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists. You had people that took advantage of our veterans. They've hit them. They were sadists. They were sick people. You couldnât fire them. You had thieves that were stealing -- openly stealing. You couldn't fire them. I got a bill passed: VA Accountability.
01:54:17 - 01:54:36 (20 sec),"Now you look at the guy, you say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired. Get out."" Nobody thought we could get it. For 40 years they tried to get it. For 40 years they tried to get it; they couldn't get it. And VA Choice, they thought -- for many, many decades they'd been trying to get VA Choice."
01:54:36 - 01:55:02 (26 sec),"You couldnât get it. Now, instead of waiting on line for two days, nine days, three weeks -- people were dying. People that weren't very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later. Now these great veterans, if there's a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor. We pay the bills."
01:55:02 - 01:55:33 (30 sec),"They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved -- for our veterans. We love our veterans. And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from Vietnam, where I had very productive meetings with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Very productive."
01:55:33 - 01:55:50 (17 sec),"We get along. We've developed a good relationship -- very good -- and made great historic progress. And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: ""Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that."" You know, they're telling me how to negotiate."
01:55:50 - 01:56:11 (21 sec),"These guys died. One administration gave billions of dollars to him and got nothing. And we haven't given him anything yet. I look forward to maybe doing something at some point. But I know one thing: I'm going to get other countries to give. Maybe not us, but I'm going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out."
01:56:11 - 01:56:42 (31 sec),"If it all works out. But I had to walk. Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal wasn't a deal that was acceptable to me. I don't like these deals that politicians make. They make a deal just for the sake of doing it. I don't want to do that. I want to make a deal that either works, or let's not make it. But the one thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up. No nuclear testing."
01:56:42 - 01:57:07 (25 sec),"We got our great people back. We get our great, great people. And that includes our beautiful, beautiful Otto -- Otto Warmbier -- whose parents I've gotten to know, who's incredible. And I'm in such a horrible position, because in one way I have to negotiate. In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto."
01:57:07 - 01:57:41 (34 sec),"And it's a very, very delicate balance. He was a special young man. And to see what happened was so bad. It was so bad. And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea, and any success that we hopefully have -- and we've had a lot. We're given no credit. They don't remember that, in the last days of the Obama administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on. Mountains were being -- these are big mountains."
01:57:41 - 01:58:01 (20 sec),"They were being shoved over three, four inches. People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons -- nuclear testing. So much. We're getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from many, many years ago. Mike Pence was in Hawaii. It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies."
01:58:01 - 01:58:22 (21 sec),"We've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to make progress. And I really think what we're doing there is very important. But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting. In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front."
01:58:22 - 01:58:43 (20 sec),"But you see, that's not what happened there. So already, I think we're negotiating. And I'll tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal. But they don't have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons. It's really a bad thing for them. So we'll see how it all goes."
01:58:43 - 01:59:06 (23 sec),"But I think it's going well. I think we learned a lot over the last couple of days. And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong. And that's an important thing, especially when we're dealing with this kind of a situation. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
01:59:06 - 01:59:32 (26 sec),"You saw that. Would you like to apologize? No. I'm not apologizing. Now you have a President who is standing up for America. After decades of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with American hands, American grit, and with beautiful, beautiful American steel."
01:59:32 - 02:00:05 (33 sec),"We are fighting to ensure that every young American inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul. Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of CPAC. And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible."
02:00:05 - 02:00:30 (26 sec),"Your organization is incredible. Matt and Mercedes, incredible. You're energized, you're mobilized, and you're engaged. We need your voice. We need your patriotism. We need your commitment. We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July. We are having, in Washington, D.C., a great tribute to America."
02:00:30 - 02:00:59 (29 sec),"I hope you can all come. Fourth of July -- keep it open. We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country. Those are the people we want. The Fourth of July. A salute to America. Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history. Now is the time to defend our American legacy."
02:00:59 - 02:01:23 (24 sec),"And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny. And, by the way, I'm watching those doors. Not one person has left, and I've been up here a long time. [Laughter] I said, ""Matt, is that okay?"" He said, ""I love it. Don't leave."" But not one person. So if you hear tomorrow, when they read ""people left"" -- nobody left early."
02:01:23 - 02:01:57 (34 sec),"There hasn't been one person that's left. But when you read it, you just say ""fake news."" This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God. Together, we are one people, one family, and one nation, forever united behind one great American flag."
02:01:57 - 02:02:33 (36 sec),"Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country. We're hooked in all over the country. Thank you very much. I want to thank CPAC. What a job they've done. What a job Matt Schlapp and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it's never been before. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much."
00:00:00 - 00:00:22 (23 sec),"That's such a great song. We should just let it play, right? [Laughter] We had a little luck with that song. And he's terrific -- a good supporter. We appreciate it. We really appreciate this, too. I know you have a record crowd; that's nice. It's always nice to set records. And I want to thank Sonny. And he's setting records."
00:00:22 - 00:00:39 (17 sec),"We're setting records together for farmers and for agriculture. We've had so many good weeks and good days, and it's only going to get better because we're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you're not even going to believe it. Your problem will be: What do we do? We need more acreage immediately."
00:00:39 - 00:00:56 (16 sec),"We got to plant. But I will say, we are doing some things with trade that are going to have a tremendous impact. You're going to be doing business with Canada, you're going to be doing business with places where it was very, very difficult to do business. It was very unfair. And a lot of great things are going to happen."
00:00:56 - 00:01:23 (28 sec),"So, I want to really thank everybody here, and I want to congratulate a very, very good and exciting football team that I watched yesterday, the New Orleans Saints. [Applause] You know, it's -- I can see there's a little group over here. I know who I'm talking to. The rest of the room is going like, Eh, I don't want to talk about that. [Laughter] But you have to say, Drew Brees -- he's one hell of a quarterback and it was a tremendous game."
00:01:23 - 00:01:50 (26 sec),"And so congratulations to the folks from this area and from this great state. [Applause] It's a great state. I'm thrilled to be here in a state that I've had a lot of luck with -- and I love a lot of people in this state; I know a lot of people -- for, really, a truly historic occasion. This is the 100th annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation -- 100 exactly."
00:01:50 - 00:02:22 (32 sec),"If it was 99 -- although, I was here for 99, too, I have to be honest, right? I like the farmers. What can I do? I like farmers. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. For 100 years, this organization has faithfully represented the men and women who are the backbone of our country, truly. Let us all show our appreciation for a very dear friend and a leader -- a great leader -- Zippy Duval."
00:02:22 - 00:02:56 (34 sec),"Where's Zippy? Zippy. [Applause] Where is, Zippy? What a job he does. He only called about 100 times to make sure I'm coming. [Laughter] Thank you, Zippy. Great job. On this special anniversary, we gather to celebrate America's proud farming heritage. Through your sweat, through all of your work, the strength of your hands, and the faith in your hearts, the American farmer feeds, and fuels, and sustains our nation."
00:02:56 - 00:03:29 (33 sec),"So true. We are joined today by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. Thank you, Governor, for being here. Thank you. Thank you, John Bel. [Applause] Thank you. Along with many members of Congress who are true champions of American agriculture. An incredibly talented man, a great doctor -- he knows more about healthcare than anybody, and he's somebody that -- he's really helped us out in so many different ways."
00:03:29 - 00:03:47 (19 sec),"And he's yours: Senator Bill Cassidy. Bill? Thank you very much, Bill. [Applause] Appreciate it. A woman who had a tremendous victory -- she came in for a short period of time. She was appointed, and it's always hard when you're appointed. If you look -- I don't know about this, Cindy, but you take a look -- they don't do too well."
00:03:47 - 00:04:17 (30 sec),"You did very well. You won in an incredible state: Mississippi. Cindy Hyde-Smith, thank you. That was a great win. [Applause] A brilliant guy -- he's very deceiving. My wife said, I love watching him on television. And I said, Who? John Kennedy. I said, John Kennedy? I don't know. But, you know, I thought maybe she was talking about the other John Kennedy."
00:04:17 - 00:04:37 (20 sec),"She was talking -- this is a man who is totally brilliant. You know, I don't know if you know what this means: Oxford. Right? He went to Oxford. Oxford is a very -- I'm very much into the world of schools. Oxford -- you have to be very, very smart to go to Oxford. And he's very smart. He also loves this state."
00:04:37 - 00:04:55 (18 sec),"He loves the people. We gave a rally the night before he won that was incredible. And I looked -- and I looked at that crowd. We had to have 40,000 people or more at a hangar -- an airport hangar. I said, You know, John Kennedy? You're going to win. And he won and he won big. And he's my friend. John Kennedy."
00:04:55 - 00:05:21 (26 sec),"Thank you, John. [Applause] Oxford. Oxford John. [Laughs] Great. Congressman Ralph Abraham. Thank you, Congressman. Where are you? Congressman? [Applause] Great job you do. He does a great job. Congressman Garrett Graves. And you know Garrett. Thank you, Garrett. Good job. Young, strong, smart. [Applause] We got a lot of good politicians down here."
00:05:21 - 00:05:50 (29 sec),"And the legend from Louisiana -- a man who's got a lot of courage. He was playing second base and it didn't work out so well for him that day, but I have never seen anybody with more strength and really more courage than Steve Scalise. Steve Scalise. [Applause] He got hit hard. He got hit hard. He never even thought about quitting."
00:05:50 - 00:06:05 (15 sec),"He -- I was there the night, in his hospital. And they didn't think he was going to make it. And I looked at him; he wasn't looking too good, I have to tell you. This is the first time I'm telling you this, Steve; you weren't looking too sharp. And his wife loves him, because she was a mess. She had tears pouring down."
00:06:05 - 00:06:24 (19 sec),"I'll tell you a couple of these little facts. Your family loves you, Steve. But all of a sudden, he started making a little progress, a little more. Worked so hard. And then, a few months ago, he was in a baseball game. And it was the Republicans against the Democrats. He's playing second base. And he didn't have great mobility, to be honest."
00:06:24 - 00:06:44 (20 sec),"In other words, moving like a foot to his right, a foot to the left -- that was about it. And he gets the first pitch of the game. This is in a stadium, and a lot of people watching, and it's on television. And they put him at second base for one play. And the first hit is a smash -- ground ball -- hit at Steve."
00:06:44 - 00:07:02 (18 sec),"And I'm pretty good at this stuff; I look, I say, Oh, that's going right to second base. It went right in him -- right at him. He bent down, stopped that ball, threw it to first. The place went crazy. And he then walked off the field in great triumph. [Laughter and applause] Who could have done that but my Steve, right?"
00:07:02 - 00:07:22 (20 sec),"[Applause] That was incredible. That was incredible. He's a courageous guy. He's a great guy. He's also a really fine person. So, Steve Scalise -- what you've been through, Steve, is incredible. And congratulations. Incredible job. As you all know, there is currently a tremendous humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border."
00:07:22 - 00:07:41 (19 sec),"It's tremendous. It's been there for years. It's been there for decades. But because of what we're doing and because of how well our country is doing -- And please sit down. Please. I'm just looking -- and then the media -- the fake news -- they'll say, He got no standing ovations. You know why? Because everybody stayed standing."
00:07:41 - 00:08:11 (30 sec),"[Laughter] Wait until you see that. It's true. Oh, they'll do it. They'll figure something out. [Applause] That's true. [Applause] That's true. [Laughs] [Applause] That's true. They can figure it out. They can take the best thing -- I go home, I say, Darling, I did such a great job. Wait until you see the news tomorrow on something. [Laughter] North Korea, China."
00:08:11 - 00:08:26 (16 sec),"We're doing great in the trade deal. China -- this, that. They can make anything you do look bad. But I was watching as you're standing. And I said, You know, if they sit, it's probably better for me, because every once in a while, they'll stand. [Laughter] The other way, they'll say, The crowd did not appreciate him."
00:08:26 - 00:08:49 (22 sec),"They didn't give him one standing ovation. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you very much. Women and children are being ruthlessly exploited at our southern border by vicious coyotes -- who would think of this? Human traffickers. Now, when you hear the words human traffickers, you think about 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago."
00:08:49 - 00:09:14 (25 sec),"You wouldn't think it's worse today in the world -- this is a world problem -- than it's ever been. And the reason it's worse is because of the Internet. They target young women. They target young children -- the Internet. And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped -- their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape."
00:09:14 - 00:09:32 (18 sec),"They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the backseat of cars and vans, and they go -- they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that. They come in through our border, where we don't have any barriers or walls."
00:09:32 - 00:09:54 (23 sec),"And they drive right in and they have no problems. And we'll get that stopped. We're going to have a wall. We're going to have a barrier. We're going to have something that's going to be very strong. [Applause] One of the most important things. And I've built a lot of wall. You saw it the other day. They kept saying, You didn't build wall. I said, I built wall. So I actually decided I'd better put a picture for you to see."
00:09:54 - 00:10:22 (28 sec),"But we built a lot more than that. And we renovated a lot of pretty good stuff that we made good again. It was in very bad shape. But we've done a lot. We want to finish it because, you know, you can't have openings. Because if you have an opening, they go here and they just sort of go over this way. They find the open spot, they come in. And we have to build -- what we have to build -- probably a total of 550 miles including the renovations."
00:10:22 - 00:10:43 (21 sec),"And we've done a lot of work. People don't talk about it. I don't talk about it because, until we're finished, the big thing is we have to get it done. And we've had great support from John, your senator; Bill, your senator; from everybody. We've had tremendous -- Steve is working hard in the House. Your congressmen are working really hard."
00:10:43 - 00:11:07 (23 sec),"Really hard. Because it's common sense. What we're talking about is common sense. Last month alone, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought across our borders. Twenty thousand. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the journey up from Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador. Think of that. Think of that."
00:11:07 - 00:11:37 (31 sec),"Hard to believe. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are being smuggled across the border. Most of the drugs coming into our country come in through the southern border -- and much of it comes through areas that are not your portals -- including meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl. Heroin alone, if you look at the heroin epidemic -- it's an epidemic -- heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week."
00:11:37 - 00:11:58 (21 sec),And 90 percent of it -- at least -- crosses our southern border. It comes in through our southern border. And I've spent a lot of time with Secret Service and with Border Patrol and ICE -- incredible people -- and they show me the methods that they use -- how they hide it. They put it in hubcaps. They put it in engines.
00:11:58 - 00:12:22 (24 sec),"They put it in areas you wouldn't believe. They're brilliant, in many ways. They're brilliant. You wouldn't even think of what they do to get things in. And we can stop it. But we can't stop it if we're going to play politics. And the numbers you're talking about are peanuts compared -- you'll make the money back numerous times a year."
00:12:22 - 00:13:05 (43 sec),"In 2017, drugs killed over 70,000 of our fellow citizens -- think of that, that's like a football stadium loaded up -- and imposed costs on our society in excess of $700 billion dollars. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested 266,000 illegal aliens -- think of that -- with criminal records, including 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent murders or killings."
00:13:05 - 00:13:29 (24 sec),"The crisis of illegal immigration impacts all Americans -- threatening public safety, overwhelming public resources, straining our local schools and hospitals, undermining U.S. workers, and claiming countless innocent lives. And I will tell you, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally."
00:13:29 - 00:14:05 (36 sec),"They have to come in through a process. [Applause] Thank you. As President, the defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty. And this is the defense of our nation, just like we prepare for other nations that you think more traditionally is what that sentence refers to. When it comes to keeping the American people safe, I will never, ever back down."
00:14:05 - 00:14:22 (17 sec),"I didn't need this fight. This is a rough fight. We're dealing against people who think that if they can stop me from building the wall -- again, we've already done a lot of work -- but they think that's a good thing for 2020, because they're not going to win. They think if they can stop me from building the wall, that's good."
00:14:22 - 00:14:40 (17 sec),"This is the reason why they don't want the wall built -- because they all know it works. They all approved it numerous times. I mean, Chuck Schumer had his hand up every time this would come up. The senators know this. They're only doing this because of the 2020 election because I said I'll build the wall and I'm going to build the wall."
00:14:40 - 00:15:17 (38 sec),"And it's only one of many things that I promised. I mean, if you look at -- [Applause] -- I got you the biggest tax cut -- beyond the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. ANWR, getting rid of the individual mandate, the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country -- and we're going further. [Applause] That might be the biggest reason that our country is doing so much better than other countries and why we're doing so well."
00:15:17 - 00:15:36 (19 sec),"But they view this as a political thing because this was one of the big things I -- I said, We're going to do tax cuts. We're going to do regulation. We're going to doâ¦ And, you know, we've done most of what we said. One of the -- that's a lot of news back there. One of the folks back there said that He's actually done more than he promised. It's true."
00:15:36 - 00:15:58 (22 sec),"I have actually done more than I promised. We've done a lot. Even with the veterans. [Applause] A lot of veterans in Louisiana. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Choice approved, which is pretty amazing. They've been trying to get that for years and years -- decades and decades. And we got Accountability -- VA Accountability."
00:15:58 - 00:16:21 (23 sec),"When you had somebody treating our veterans horribly, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't fire them -- whether it's unions, or whether it's civil service, or whatever it may have been. But for decades and decades, somebody could do anything they wanted. They can steal, they could abuse our veterans, they can be sadists, they can do whatever they want and you couldn't fire them."
00:16:21 - 00:16:47 (26 sec),"And I got Accountability approved. Everyone said you couldn't get that -- too much power against it. We got it done, and now we can say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here. We don't want you taking care of our veterans. [Applause] That was a big thing. A lot of help from those people. So we got a lot done, but they view the wall as being a big item that, if I don't do it, you know, it's a negative."
00:16:47 - 00:17:14 (27 sec),"It's a negative. And I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm doing it because we have to do it. It's common sense. We have to do it. If you look at the caravans coming up, if you look at what's going on -- you take a look. If we didn't have some of those walls -- the military has been incredible. They came up and they built some barriers -- they kept thousands and thousands of people from overrunning various sections of our country."
00:17:14 - 00:17:39 (25 sec),"We've done a great job at the border, but we need that extra -- we need that barrier because you can't do this. You can have all the people you want dressed in military. You can have ICE. You can have Border Patrol. If you don't have that barrier, there's not a thing you can do. You know, they all say, We like technology. I like technology, too."
00:17:39 - 00:18:08 (29 sec),"But we can have all the drones in the world flying around; we can have all the sensors in the world, but if you don't have a strong steel or concrete barrier, there's no way you're going to stop these people from rushing. Last week -- and we have no idea who they are. And you got some -- I'm sure -- very good ones, but you got some real bad ones."
00:18:08 - 00:18:52 (44 sec),"Last week, I traveled to McAllen, Texas to tour the border and meet with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. These great patriots made clear what they need from Congress and to end this terrible crisis. And we will end it. We will end it. You know, when we have proper security, people aren't going to come, except for the people we want to come because we want to take people in to help our farmers, et cetera."
00:18:52 - 00:19:09 (17 sec),"Very important. We're going to make that actually easier for them -- to help the farmers. [Applause] Because you need these people. No, you need these people. We're going to make it easier. [Applause] I mean, I'm glad I told you that because, you know, look, you're in that business and a lot of people don't understand this."
00:19:09 - 00:19:29 (20 sec),"You need those -- you need people to help you with the farms. And I'm not going to rule that out. I'm going to make that easier for them to come in and to work the farms. You've had some people for 20, 25 years. They're incredible. Then they go home and they can't get back in. That's not going to happen."
00:19:29 - 00:19:59 (30 sec),"But we're keeping the wrong ones out, okay? We don't want the wrong ones coming into our country. And, for that, it's going to be almost impossible to get in. For the people that work the farms, that have been here, that have gone through this very short but good process, that are going to help our country, it's going to be easier for them to get in that what they have to go through now."
00:19:59 - 00:20:26 (26 sec),"So just remember that. [Applause] I know a lot about the farming world. And, if I don't, Sonny teaches me. They explained that there is no substitute for a wall -- these are the ICE people and the Border Patrol people -- or a physical barrier. There is no substitute. Where a barrier exists, illegal crossings plummet dramatically."
00:20:26 - 00:20:56 (30 sec),"In El Paso, they had -- it was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. A wall was put up. It went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight -- overnight. Does that tell you something? [Applause] And I can give you many examples of that."
00:20:56 - 00:21:22 (26 sec),"They say it's medieval -- a wall. It is medieval. So is a wheel. I always say a wheel. But every time I look out, they all have wheels. You know, they may have gone electric and they may have done lots of different things, but every car I've seen still has wheels. [Laughter] Wheels work and walls work."
00:21:22 - 00:21:41 (18 sec),"You know, there's some things you can't beat. [Applause] That's why we've asked Congress to fund a steel barrier, or whatever you want to call it. This barrier will stop illegal activity, while directing lawful trade, travel, and commerce to our ports of entry. These ports are America's doors, but doors only work when you have strength."
00:21:41 - 00:22:00 (20 sec),"We need strength. Right now, we have weakness. They're forming a new caravan in Honduras. Honduras is not helping us. They could stop it. We send them hundreds of millions of dollars a year -- El Salvador, Honduras, and other places -- Guatemala -- hundreds of millions, but they don't help us, like so many nations."
00:22:00 - 00:22:22 (22 sec),We help them; they don't help us. We don't even get their votes often when we need their vote in the United Nations. They don't vote for us. Why? Because the wrong people are asking them. So those days are over. So I said just before I came -- we're looking at a whole plan -- why are we sending them money if they're allowing caravans to form right in the middle of their cities?
00:22:22 - 00:22:46 (24 sec),"Why are we sending them money? [Applause] A lot of changes have been made in this country in less than two years, I will tell you that. A lot of changes. And really good changes -- changes that people like you, with common sense and smarts, fully understand. And that's why we're liking where we are and the country is changing very rapidly for the better."
00:22:46 - 00:23:12 (27 sec),"As part of our overall border security plan, we have also asked Congress to approve cutting-edge technology to detect drugs. There's incredible technology today. So when these cars do come in through the ports of entry, you have technology today that's so incredible. We don't use it. We don't have it because our leaders decided not to spend the money."
00:23:12 - 00:23:35 (23 sec),"Well, you make it back every month -- probably more than that -- because the drugs coming through the southern border are destroying the fabric of our country. It's so bad. It's so bad. [Applause] So we have to stop it. This technology is incredible. To fund more agents -- we're putting that high on the list -- officers, beds."
00:23:35 - 00:24:06 (31 sec),"Believe it or not, we're one of the only countries -- I say one, because every time I say something else they'll say, Oh, well, there was a country that also did it. Somebody comes into our country, they touch one foot on the ground, and we have to catch them. It's called, catch. We then take their names and we bring them to a court -- can you believe this?"
00:24:06 - 00:24:24 (17 sec),"-- and we release them. But, see, we're trying to do catch-and-hold. Catch-and-not-release. But you have to release. So we release. And they go into our country, and then you announce -- these are the laws -- then you say, Come back in three years for your trial. Tell me, what percentage of people come back?"
00:24:24 - 00:24:43 (19 sec),"Would you say 100 percent? No, you're a little off. Like, how about 2 percent? [Laughter] And those people, you almost don't want, because they cannot be very smart. [Laughter] Two percent. Two percent. Two percent come back. Those two percent are not going to make America great again, that I can tell you."
00:24:43 - 00:25:02 (19 sec),"[Laughter and applause] Crazy. So we have that and we have chain migration, where somebody comes in, and then his mother comes in, his father comes in, his grandmother comes in, his uncle comes in, his cousins come in. We had a guy -- a radical Islamic terrorist in New York -- area I know very well -- driving down the West Side highway."
00:25:02 - 00:25:23 (21 sec),"Beautiful -- Hudson River to his right. We built this gorgeous park all along the river. It's gorgeous. People are running; they're in great shape. We ought to all -- some of these guys in the front row, they should do it with me. We could run. [Laughter] Some of my friends over there. Sonny -- maybe Sonny and I will go take a jog."
00:25:23 - 00:25:43 (20 sec),"[Laughter] But you know what? I'll tell you, these are people that are great people, and they're running and they keep -- and this horrible person, going down 60 miles an hour down a highway, decides, Oh, that's nice. We'll make a right turn. Hits a whole group of people purposely, screaming all sorts of things that they scream."
00:25:43 - 00:26:11 (28 sec),"And 8 people died; 12 or 13 were injured. Nobody talks about the injured. You know, some of the injured lost legs, lost arms. You know, this is -- they say, Oh, well, 12 were injured. You know, like, injured -- you think, like, a headache. No, no. They lost arms. They lost legs. One lost two legs. So 12 were horribly injured."
00:26:11 - 00:26:32 (21 sec),"And he's allowed to have his family come here. So they checked, and they said that he had about 22 people came in -- chain migration. In other words, because he's here -- so a whole group of people come in. And we don't want that. We have another one -- the lottery. The lottery. We take people from countries through the lottery."
00:26:32 - 00:26:59 (27 sec),"Now, this is common sense. Do you think the country is giving us their finest? No, they're not. No, they're not. They're giving us the opposite of their finest. And we have a lottery system. Oh, let's pick him out. Oh, wonderful. Doesn't work out too well, this lottery system. But this is the law. This was passed by Democrats and, I guess, Republicans."
00:26:59 - 00:27:18 (19 sec),"You know, maybe they voted -- who knows? But these are laws that have to be changed. These are -- these are sick, demented laws that we have to change. We can't allow this to keep happening. The people that are sent to our country are not the people that we want. They come in through the lottery. They come in through chain migration."
00:27:18 - 00:27:50 (31 sec),"Think of it: This man that killed 8 people and so badly injured 12, they say he's about 22 relatives coming in that are here. And take a look at how well his relatives are doing. It's not a good picture. So we have to change our laws. It's very hard because the Democrats don't want to change them. But I hope that common sense and people like this can persuade them, because it's gotten to a point where you have to. We really have no choice."
00:27:50 - 00:28:16 (27 sec),"And we're fighting hard. We're fighting very hard for you. We're making a lot of progress, I can tell you that. [Applause] Here with us today is Jim Chilton from Arizona. Jim's ranch runs along the U.S-Mexico border. The deadly -- very deadly -- Sinaloa cartel, one of the most vicious drug cartels anywhere in the world, runs a major drug trafficking route right through Jim's ranch."
00:28:16 - 00:28:36 (19 sec),"Many of these routes used to run through San Diego until the wall was built by us, by me. [Applause] Sorry about that, Jim. [Laughs] I think Jim has just got angry at me; he just heard that. Sorry, Jim. Because now, what they did, they went to Jim's ranch. I think I cost him a lot of money. Maybe he won't stand up after all."
00:28:36 - 00:29:35 (60 sec),"But it's a very sad situation. In the last two years, the cameras on Jim's ranch have captured roughly 1,000 pictures of major drug packers, they call them. For years, these criminals have damaged Jim's property, injured his livestock, and started dozens of fire, which Jim estimates cost more than $2 million dollars in 2017 alone."
00:29:35 - 00:30:09 (33 sec),"Last June, a Border Patrol agent was checking sensors on the Clinton's -- and Chilton's ranch when he was shot multiple times by these sinister drug traffickers. Multiple times. And they don't even think about. By the way, they shoot -- it's not like, Oh, gee, I committed a terrible thing. They don't even think about it. They don't even think."
00:30:09 - 00:30:21 (13 sec),"They wake up the next morning and they couldn't care less. As Jim has said, Every time I leave the ranch, my wife doesn't know whether I'll ever return. I would like to ask Jim to come up and say a few words. Jim, please come up. Thank you. [Applause]"
00:30:21 - 00:30:31 (9 sec),"Mr. President, we need a wall. [Applause] I would say we need a wall all around all the length of the border. We've got to stop the drug packers bringing drugs in to poison our people. And I would say to Speaker Pelosi, walls are not immoral. [Applause]"
00:30:31 - 00:30:50 (19 sec),"In fact, I've traveled around the world, and the biggest wall I've ever seen is around the Vatican. Now, you can't tell me that the wonderful priest and officials of the Roman Catholic Church, including the Pope, are immoral. They have a wall. Why can't we? [Applause]"
00:30:50 - 00:31:11 (20 sec),"Thank you, Jim. [Applause] Thank you, Jim. And I'm sorry for your problems, but we'll get it straightened out. The government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: The Democrats will not fund border security, our safety, our national security. People come from many countries."
00:31:11 - 00:31:34 (23 sec),"When I was at the wall the other day, Border Patrol said they have 150 people they caught that day who weren't from Mexico. I said, That's a strange statement. They said, No, these are the people that weren't from Mexico. And I was surprised. Three were from Pakistan. Four were from another Mid-East -- two Mid-East countries."
00:31:34 - 00:32:00 (26 sec),"And many of them were from other countries, including China -- countries all over the world. A hundred and fifty of the people, as he said, were not from Mexico. Now, they caught many, many more, but that's a 150 people coming from companies that -- you know, really, countries that you wouldn't believe. They will not approve the measures we need to keep America safe -- the Democrats."
00:32:00 - 00:32:18 (18 sec),"We can't do that. We can't do that because this is of paramount importance to our country. And again, I could take it nice and easy. I could enjoy myself. I could relax. I've been in the White House because I think it's very important to be there. And other people went on a nice, wonderful vacation over the weekend."
00:32:18 - 00:32:44 (26 sec),They had a great time. I would have loved to have been with them. I didn't like the look of it. I would have loved to have been with them. But we have a very big problem. This should have been done by other Presidents. Just like the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem should have been done -- it was promised by many other Presidents. [Applause]
00:32:44 - 00:33:07 (23 sec),"Just like we're doing the job on North Korea, just like we're doing the job with China -- we're getting it done. We're getting it done. We're getting it all done. But it would have been nice if other administrations were able to do it. But we have to do the border. In the meantime, the USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown."
00:33:07 - 00:33:30 (23 sec),"We thank you for your support and patriotism. And we fight to defend our nation. We are fighting very hard to defend our nation. And many people that aren't getting a payment, that aren't being paid, have let us know in the strongest of terms -- a big amount -- they said, Sir, what you're doing is of paramount importance."
00:33:30 - 00:33:56 (25 sec),"Do the job right, and we are with you, 100 percent. You'd be surprised at how many people have said that. And it's not easy for them, but it's a lot of people. [Applause] So I'm asking all of our citizens to call your Democrat lawmakers and ask them to pass a bill that secures our border, protects our country, and now reopens our government."
00:33:56 - 00:34:17 (21 sec),"Because as soon as they do that, we reopen our government. You would think that would be a very simple task. On every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers. We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible. I saw what was going on in Canada -- the way you were treated."
00:34:17 - 00:34:41 (24 sec),"Horrible. And they treated their farmers great. Great. We changed it with the new trade deal we made with Mexico and Canada. And opening up new markets to export -- many, many new markets are being opened up. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And the farmers got hit probably as hard as anybody."
00:34:41 - 00:35:18 (37 sec),"We're reversing harmful federal intrusion. And to keep family farms in the family, we have virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Small business owners and corporations and others -- small business -- it was a terrible thing that was happening, where your parents -- you love your parents -- they're farmers -- they love their farms."
00:35:18 - 00:35:34 (15 sec),"Everybody loves their farm. The kids -- they want to grow up on the farm. They want to someday run the farm, own the farm. And they couldn't because they had very large estate taxes to pay. So they go out and borrow money, and then it turned a little bit bad. And all of the sudden, they'd end up losing the farm because they had to pay the estate tax."
00:35:34 - 00:35:53 (19 sec),"We got rid of it, folks. So if you love your children, you'll like me. If you don't love your children, and you weren't going to leave the farm to them, it probably doesn't matter too much, okay? [Laughter] Does anybody here not love their children? Wow, that's a lot of people -- not one? Okay, you don't want to say."
00:35:53 - 00:36:09 (15 sec),"That's all right. [Laughter] That's like a lot of the people that went to the polls; they voted for Trump. [Laughter] They said, We don't want to talk about it. Then we won. We won two years ago. In November, we won. [Applause] And everybody is trying -- they're still trying to figure out what happened."
00:36:09 - 00:36:37 (28 sec),"We don't have to talk about it. We know what we're doing. We're ensuring that ethanol remains a vital part of America's energy future, with E-15. And we're making it available year round -- all 12 months. That was a big, big difference for the farmers. [Applause] Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst -- your senators -- a lot of great people were very strong on that."
00:36:37 - 00:37:00 (23 sec),"And it also creates additional, because, if you noticed, I think we saw $1.75 for gasoline today, coming in. I like to do that; I'm one of these guys. [Applause] I'm riding in this incredible car, and I'm driving, and I'm looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas. How many other Presidents -- you think Hillary Clinton would have done that?"
00:37:00 - 00:37:20 (20 sec),"I don't think so. I don't think so. [Laughter and applause] I'm in the Beast -- the world's most expensive car. It's like being in an army tank that goes 50 miles an hour, right? I'm in the Beast and I'm looking at gas stations. I say, Fellas, slow up. I can't see. [Laughter] They say, $1.75. That didn't happen by accident, folks."
00:37:20 - 00:37:41 (21 sec),"That didn't happen by accident. People think it does; it doesn't. Nothing happens -- very few, very little happens by accident. Nobody else would have done what we did for the farmers, with the estate taxes and so many other things. In the two years before my election, agricultural exports dropped by nearly $23 billion."
00:37:41 - 00:38:13 (32 sec),"Remember that: Before I got here, it was heading south. A lot of people say, Oh, gee, how are we doing? It was going bad. If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office. They were less. Now they're up nearly $14 billion. In December, just a few days before Christmas, I was proud to sign the Farm Bill."
00:38:13 - 00:38:49 (36 sec),"We got it done. That wasn't easy either. [Applause] That was not easy. Senators, Congressmen, thank you. That group did it. [Applause] That was not an easy one, John and Bill, was it, huh? That wasn't easy. But we got it done. The first to be passed, on time, in over 30 years. Got it done. And I've authorized Secretary Perdue to be strong on work rules for the Food Stamp program, through regulations allowed by the bill."
00:38:49 - 00:39:12 (24 sec),"So I know you have a great Secretary. He'll do what's right. The Farm Bill delivers for our farmers on a wide range of key priorities. On critical farm programs, such as crop insurance, you will have the support you need to plan for the future. It increases the amount farmers can borrow so you can expand and improve your businesses."
00:39:12 - 00:39:37 (25 sec),"It also secures the $600 million commitment we made to build a modern, effective, rural broadband across America's heartland. You're not well serviced. [Applause] That's something the great, great middle part of our country has been complaining about for a long time. You're not properly serviced. You will be now."
00:39:37 - 00:40:08 (31 sec),"You will be now. That bill is a great bill for the farmer. Last year, when I spoke to you, we had just passed our historic tax cuts. Here with us today is Kalena Bruce from Stockton, Missouri. Kalena is a rancher, and also an accountant for local farmers. Under our new tax plan, which lowers rates for small businesses and doubles the tax child credit -- so important, that child tax credit."
00:40:08 - 00:40:30 (22 sec),"You know who fought for that? A young woman named Ivanka Trump. That's all she wanted. Dad? Dad? We have to get that passed, Dad. [Applause] I said, Okay, Ivanka. Okay. Okay. [Laughter] It turned out to be so popular. Kalena has seen that many families will save upwards of $4,000 in taxes this year alone."
00:40:30 - 00:40:54 (25 sec),"Kalena, I want to thank you and all of those incredible people that you represent. And just keep up the great work. Where is Kalena? Where is Kalena? She's around here someplace. Hi, Kalena. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. [Applause] We're also leading the most sweeping regulatory reform at any time in our history."
00:40:54 - 00:41:21 (27 sec),"The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled back almost $400 million in regulatory costs last year alone. And this year, they're projected to more than double those savings. We're saving farmers and ranchers from one of the most ridiculous regulations ever imposed on anybody in our nation: the Waters of the United States rule."
00:41:21 - 00:41:59 (38 sec),"[Applause] Disaster -- other than the title. Such a beautiful title. It was a total kill on farmers, on builders, on everybody. It was a total kill. Sounds so nice. In fact, I looked at John Kennedy, when I signed that. I said, John, I'm going to get killed for this one. Because what we did was take something -- the Water of the United States. How beautiful is that?"
00:41:59 - 00:42:19 (20 sec),"And yet, everything inside was a total kill on you -- and other businesses, by the way. [Applause] And we didn't get killed, did we, John, huh? We didn't. They love it. So many people have come -- and, you know, the time when I signed that bill, I had ranchers, farmers, and some homebuilders behind me. And these are tough people."
00:42:19 - 00:42:38 (19 sec),"They were strong, tough men and women. And half of them were crying because we basically -- our government stole their property. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't build. They couldn't do anything. They were crying. I said, What are you crying about? The one guy -- I don't think he cried in his whole life."
00:42:38 - 00:43:00 (22 sec),"I don't think he cried when we was a baby. He was crying. [Laughter] He said, Sir, you gave me back my life. You gave me back my property. They took it away -- environmentally, took it away. And you're going to do the right thing. In the audience today is Val Wagner from Monango, North Dakota. Val -- [Applause]. [Laughs] It's a good place."
00:43:00 - 00:43:22 (22 sec),"[Laughter] You have a great new senator, by the way. [Applause] A great new senator. Really great. Val and her husband would love to expand their farm for their four boys, but under the Waters of the United States rule, they would have to pay tens and of thousands of dollars in fines because of the prairie potholes on their land."
00:43:22 - 00:43:48 (25 sec),"Do you all know what prairie potholes are? Yes, you do. I don't, but it sounds bad. [Laughter] To Val and to every farmer, we are going to keep federal regulators out of your -- out of your tanks -- your stock tanks, your drainage ditches, your puddles, and your ponds. And you know exactly what I'm talking about."
00:43:48 - 00:44:21 (34 sec),"You could have a pond -- a little pond -- and they consider it a lake. [Applause] And you're regulated as though it were a lake. We're going to get government off your backs so you can earn a living and support your families doing what you love. And I know what you love. Farmers love what they're doing. [Applause] We also passed legislation to rebuild our water infrastructure, including our nation's inland waterways, which carry more than 60 percent of our agricultural products."
00:44:21 - 00:44:48 (27 sec),"We are replacing one-sided, unfair trade deals. We have so many nations -- it's a one-sided deal. With China, every year, for many years, we're losing $375 billion -- not million, billion dollars. We're working on that very strongly. You see what's going on. We're doing very well. We have the European Union -- they don't treat us right."
00:44:48 - 00:45:05 (17 sec),"They treat our farmers terribly. You can hardly sell into the -- they have barriers and they have tariffs that are massive. But with the farmers, they don't want your product. We're working with them; they have to treat us fairly. We're losing $151 billion a year with the European Union. It sounds so nice, right?"
00:45:05 - 00:45:21 (17 sec),"The European Union. And then the press gets angry. They say, Donald Trump is not treating the European Union fairly. Well, that's because they're not treating us fairly, folks. I want to be nice. In fact, they said my poll numbers are very bad in Europe. I said, They should be. [Laughter] No, seriously."
00:45:21 - 00:45:59 (38 sec),"They said, When he started off, he had 87 percent. That means you could be the king of any country. Now, they [Inaudible] because I'm representing our country; I'm not representing those country -- you know, one of those [Inaudible]. [Applause] True. It's true. They said, His poll numbers have tanked. And I said, Oh, damn it. What's going on? Damn it. And then I said, Oh, it's in Europe."
00:45:59 - 00:46:24 (25 sec),"That's okay. [Laughter] No, we get along well with them. And they're a lot of great people and great leaders. But, look, I'm not blaming them. I don't blame China. I mean, China -- $375 billion a year, we lose. It's really more than that, but that's like the conservative number. I think it's $504 [Billion]. But I'm giving you conservative because I don't want to be criticized for using wrong numbers, right?"
00:46:24 - 00:46:43 (19 sec),"[Laughter] But I don't blame China. I was in China making a speech, and President Xi -- who's a friend of -- great guy. But he represent them; I represent us. And he's sitting over here. And I'm talking to this massive crowd of people. And I'm talking about how China is bad, bad, bad. And I'm saying, Boy, this is -- this could be dangerous. [Laughter] I'm in China."
00:46:43 - 00:47:14 (30 sec),"I'm in Beijing doing this. And I'm saying, I don't like this. But I looked at him, and I realized -- actually during that speech -- it's not his fault or their fault. It's our fault for allowing that to happen. It's our leaders' fault. [Applause] Over the last 15 years, we've seen a continual decline in the U.S. share of agricultural trade all throughout the world."
00:47:14 - 00:47:30 (16 sec),"You know that. It was all going in the wrong direction. It's changing now. Wait until you see what happens. If we do the right deal with China, you're talking about massive -- they're already backordering, right? They're already back. I told them. I said, You got to start ordering. You're going to order. They're going to order, and they've already started."
00:47:30 - 00:48:05 (35 sec),"We're turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American farmers, ranchers, and, in fact, put America first. That's what I'm interested in: America first. [Applause] We just opened Argentina to American pork exports -- pork -- for the first time in a quarter of a century. They needed something; I said, You have to open it up to pork. And they said, Okay. I said, Why didn't you do it before? They said, Nobody ever asked us. [Laughter] A lot of it is that."
00:48:05 - 00:48:30 (24 sec),"You would be amazed. Nobody ever asks. India and Morocco have both opened their markets to our poultry exports. We do so much for them. It's incredible. Japan opened its market to U.S. exports of potatoes from Idaho -- [Applause] -- and lamb from the great state of Texas, yes. No, they just opened up. We asked them."
00:48:30 - 00:48:51 (22 sec),"We said, You got to open up. Sorry. U.S. beef has been shipped to Brazil for the first time since 2003. They're going to have a great new leader. They say he's the Donald Trump of South America. Do you believe that? [Applause] And he's happy with that. If he wasn't, I wouldn't like the country so much."
00:48:51 - 00:49:21 (30 sec),"But I like him. And we opened China to American beef for the first time in many, many years. We've taken -- [Applause]. You know that. But that was before the trade deal. Don't even worry about it. This is -- that's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. We've taken the toughest-ever actions to confront China's unfair trade practices that hurt American farmers and ranchers."
00:49:21 - 00:49:59 (38 sec),"This includes China's theft of trade secrets from American agri-business. I couldn't believe how complicated your business is -- with the seeds and the genetic farming. It's incredible. People don't know this. But your secrets were being stolen by China, and, in all fairness, other countries. We want a fair deal for American farmers -- removing China's arbitrary bans on agricultural imports, safeguarding our intellectual property, and providing fair market access to all American producers."
00:49:59 - 00:50:35 (36 sec),"We have also made history by finalizing an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the USMCA. A whole different world. A whole different world. [Applause] NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made by a country. It killed our country. This landmark trade deal will increase exports of wheat from Montana, dairy from Wisconsin, chicken from Georgia, and products from farmers and ranchers all across our country."
00:50:35 - 00:51:03 (28 sec),"As part of the USMCA, Canada agreed to give fair treatment to American wheat farmers. They will now grade American wheat just like they grade their own wheat. [Applause] Which, to me, doesn't mean much, but, to farmers, it means a lot. That's what they tell me. I said, What can we do? They said that would be a big thing -- on wheat."
00:51:03 - 00:51:25 (22 sec),"Even the NFL -- you know, the NFL, for many years, was having a hard time with Canada, having to do with the Super Bowl. I heard about it, and I asked about it. And it was a lot of money, but it was tiny compared to the overall deal with Canada and with Mexico. So, as one of the things, I said, You got to treat the NFL fairly. You know, it's a great American company."
00:51:25 - 00:51:45 (20 sec),"And we had the dispute over the National Anthem, and that seems to have worked out properly, which is great, which I give them credit for now. And I said, Listen, when you go to Canada, you're going to ask for this thing because they're not treating our company right. Any company -- I don't care, but that was the NFL."
00:51:45 - 00:52:23 (38 sec),"A big company. A great American company. I said, You're not treating them well. We asked for it; in one minute, we solved a problem that they've been working on for many years. Total success. And they called up, and they thanked me. But it's something that I want to do for American companies. It's easy, it's short, it took a few minutes, and we got it. They were fighting for years."
00:52:23 - 00:52:59 (36 sec),"Canada also agreed to end unfair trade practices that hurt American dairy exports. Also here today are Cris and Gary Peterson, and their son Ben and daughter-in-law Nicki. More than 140 years ago, Gary's great-grandmother began their farm in a tremendous state -- I love this state. Remember when they say, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin? That state hasn't been won by a Republican in so long."
00:52:59 - 00:53:24 (25 sec),"Bill, you don't remember any wins there, right? That was a long time ago. That was even before your time. Right, Bill? A long time. And they said, Donald Trumpâ¦ Remember that? Was that a great evening or what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. [Applause] We love Wisconsin. Today, the Petersons have more than 900 dairy cows."
00:53:24 - 00:53:52 (28 sec),"Like so many of our great farmers, the Petersons have faced a number of threats to their farm and to their entire way of life. For years, NAFTA made it difficult for dairy farmers like the Petersons to export milk, ice cream, cheese, and many other dairy products. Under the USMCA, the Peterson family will finally have the level playing field that they should have had for many years."
00:53:52 - 00:54:17 (25 sec),"They have it now. Together, we urge Congress to support American agriculture, stand up for American workers, and hopefully they will approve the USMCA quite quickly. You know, the one thing I worry about -- it's almost -- no matter how good something is, they might not want to approve it, but they'll approve it. This one -- I think it's going to be very tough for them not."
00:54:17 - 00:54:43 (26 sec),"But I think that -- I hear it's in very good shape. And it replaces something that has been so bad to our country. This is a great deal. As we reverse the damage of decades of unfair trade, we are also providing up to $12 billion in relief to protect our farmers from unfair foreign retaliation. And you saw that recently with Sonny Perdue, where we were helping out during a very unfair period of time when people were actually trying to affect our election."
00:54:43 - 00:55:05 (22 sec),"Nobody brings that up. In this case, it was China. I haven't heard too much about that. Have you heard anything about that? But they were. And we helped our farmers out. No one understands better than our great farmers that the tough choices we make today reap rewards for centuries to come. More than 200 years ago, this very city was at the center of America's negotiations during the legendary Louisiana Purchase."
00:55:05 - 00:55:38 (32 sec),"No one knew how it would all turn out, but President Thomas Jefferson acted decisively for the American people. After months of negotiations, we got what no one ever imagined possible. Not only did we gain New Orleans, we doubled the size of the United States; we secured new parts and ports -- new parts of the map and globe that we never thought, and new ports, very importantly for American agriculture; and we made our nation the greatest farm country on God's Earth."
00:55:38 - 00:56:21 (43 sec),"And it remains that. And it's now, for the first time in a long time, getting better. [Applause] Our nation was founded, settled, and built by farmers. [Applause] From the fields of Pennsylvania to the hills of Tennessee -- [Applause]; from the plains of Missouri -- [Applause] -- to the Big Sky of Montana -- [Applause]; and from the marshes of Florida -- [Applause] -- to the fertile valley of California -- [Applause] -- farmers have always led the way."
00:56:21 - 00:56:58 (37 sec),"[Applause] The American farmer embodies the timeless values of America. You believe in hard work and self-reliance. You follow the rules, obey our laws, and respect our great American flag. [Applause] You support our communities, raise loving families, teach your children right from wrong, and you are always loyal to this magnificent nation that we so love."
00:56:58 - 00:57:30 (32 sec),"Now you have a government that is loyal to you, finally, in return. [Applause] Because we know that government's first duty is to our own citizens. We are fighting for the American farmer, and we are fighting for the American Dream, and for products made and grown with pride right here in the USA. It's what we're fighting for."
00:57:30 - 00:58:00 (30 sec),"[Applause] We are defending a cherished legacy, and we are preserving a beautiful way of life passed down from mothers and fathers to sons and daughters, from generation to generation. You are the keepers of this noble tradition. You are the guardians of this majestic heritage. We are standing up for the men and women who work the fields, till the soil, and harvest the land."
00:58:00 - 00:58:48 (48 sec),"We are protecting your rights, your freedoms, and our glorious Constitution. And we are doing it all with love in our hearts, joy in our souls, and trust in our God. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. To all of the farmers here today and across our country, the greatest harvest is yet to come. The future for America's farmers is bigger, better, bolder, and brighter than ever before."
00:58:48 - 00:59:02 (14 sec),"I just want to thank you all for being here. I'm so honored to have had this kind of a turnout, this kind of a record. I want to thank the American Farm Bureau for the incredible job they do."
00:59:02 - 00:59:26 (24 sec),"I'm proud to be a great friend of the farmer, of the rancher, of the people who so nobly do what you do. God bless you all. God bless our farmers. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. [Applause]"
00:00:00 - 00:00:29 (29 sec),"My fellow Americans. Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country."
00:00:29 - 00:01:02 (33 sec),"America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources, and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl."
00:01:02 - 00:01:40 (38 sec),"Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings."
00:01:40 - 00:02:09 (29 sec),"Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now. This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase."
00:02:09 - 00:02:34 (25 sec),These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims -- by far -- of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.
00:02:34 - 00:03:03 (29 sec),"This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security."
00:03:03 - 00:03:38 (35 sec),"These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission, and keep America safe -- in fact, safer than ever before. The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy."
00:03:38 - 00:04:10 (32 sec),"Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes, so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home. Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier."
00:04:10 - 00:04:44 (35 sec),"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress."
00:04:44 - 00:05:10 (25 sec),"The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They change their mind only after I was elected president."
00:05:10 - 00:05:37 (28 sec),"Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security."
00:05:37 - 00:06:05 (27 sec),My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.
00:06:05 - 00:06:34 (29 sec),"Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security. Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside."
00:06:34 - 00:07:00 (26 sec),The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized. America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border.
00:07:00 - 00:07:28 (27 sec),"The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history."
00:07:28 - 00:08:03 (35 sec),"In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors, were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl. Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration."
00:08:03 - 00:08:48 (45 sec),"I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? For those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered, and totally broken."
00:08:48 - 00:09:20 (32 sec),"To every member of Congress: pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen: call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve."
00:09:20 - 00:09:35 (14 sec),"When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country, and that is what I will always do, so help me God. Thank you, and good night."
00:00:00 - 00:01:27 (87 sec),"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation."
00:01:27 - 00:02:19 (53 sec),"The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican Agenda or a Democrat Agenda. It is the agenda of the American People. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first."
00:02:19 - 00:03:13 (54 sec),"There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the Majesty of America's Mission, and the Power of American Pride."
00:03:13 - 00:03:58 (45 sec),"In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade -- the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6th, 1944, fifteen thousand young American men jumped from the sky and sixty thousand more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny."
00:03:58 - 00:05:21 (83 sec),"Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon."
00:05:21 - 00:06:39 (78 sec),"Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle-class standard of living for the entire world to see."
00:06:39 - 00:07:58 (80 sec),"Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this Great American Adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our Middle Class bigger and more prosperous than ever before."
00:07:58 - 00:08:50 (52 sec),"But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future."
00:08:50 - 00:09:41 (51 sec),"The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades."
00:09:41 - 00:10:12 (30 sec),"In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom -- a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started."
00:10:12 - 00:10:49 (37 sec),"Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
00:10:49 - 00:12:42 (113 sec),"Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history -- 157 million."
00:12:42 - 00:13:57 (75 sec),"We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty â and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try."
00:13:57 - 00:14:58 (61 sec),My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American Energy -- the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.
00:14:58 - 00:16:59 (121 sec),"And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is Strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before."
00:16:59 - 00:18:06 (67 sec),"On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone -- almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation."
00:18:06 - 00:19:02 (56 sec),"It just doesn't work that way. We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate -- some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country."
00:19:02 - 00:20:05 (63 sec),"Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans."
00:20:05 - 00:20:59 (55 sec),"And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking Criminal Justice Reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path."
00:20:59 - 00:21:58 (59 sec),"She had a big impact on that prison population -- and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing -- and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice's sentence -- when I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing -- Alice is here with us tonight."
00:21:58 - 00:23:20 (82 sec),"Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. Inspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community."
00:23:20 - 00:23:59 (39 sec),"The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, states across the country are following our lead. America is a nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses."
00:23:59 - 00:25:10 (71 sec),"Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of All Americans: welcome home. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis."
00:25:10 - 00:26:06 (56 sec),"Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our Southern Border. Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business."
00:26:06 - 00:26:46 (40 sec),"As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our Southern Border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught."
00:26:46 - 00:27:21 (35 sec),"This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our Southern Border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws."
00:27:21 - 00:28:33 (72 sec),"Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration."
00:28:33 - 00:29:24 (51 sec),"Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."
00:29:24 - 00:30:20 (57 sec),Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel. 1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
00:30:20 - 00:31:06 (45 sec),"Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our Southern Border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City."
00:31:06 - 00:31:42 (36 sec),"We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads and families -- no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured."
00:31:42 - 00:32:26 (44 sec),"Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison."
00:32:26 - 00:33:44 (78 sec),"To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings."
00:33:44 - 00:34:39 (55 sec),"We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking."
00:34:39 - 00:36:19 (101 sec),"Elvin says: ""If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job."" Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars. Special Agent Hernandez please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement -- and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our Southern Border."
00:36:19 - 00:37:11 (52 sec),"It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall."
00:37:11 - 00:38:01 (50 sec),"It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings."
00:38:01 - 00:39:13 (72 sec),"The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime -- one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe."
00:39:13 - 00:42:02 (169 sec),"As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before -- and exactly one century after Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than ever before."
00:42:02 - 00:42:37 (35 sec),"As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount -- reversing decades of calamitous trade policies."
00:42:37 - 00:43:21 (43 sec),"We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion dollars of Chinese goods -- and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars."
00:43:21 - 00:44:09 (49 sec),"But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us -- I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs."
00:44:09 - 00:44:41 (31 sec),"Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried -- until now."
00:44:41 - 00:46:17 (97 sec),"Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- or USMCA -- will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure."
00:46:17 - 00:47:32 (75 sec),"I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill -- and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs -- and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions."
00:47:32 - 00:48:35 (63 sec),"Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American Patients."
00:48:35 - 00:49:59 (84 sec),"We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American Freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach."
00:49:59 - 00:51:06 (67 sec),"My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Tonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer."
00:51:06 - 00:52:06 (60 sec),"Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10 year old girl, Grace Ee-line. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer."
00:52:06 - 00:53:00 (54 sec),"Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 dollars for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: ""Last day of Keemo."" Grace -- you are an inspiration to us all."
00:53:00 - 00:54:20 (80 sec),"Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask Congress for $500 million dollars over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child."
00:54:20 - 00:55:03 (43 sec),There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth.
00:55:03 - 00:56:01 (58 sec),"These are living, feeling, beautiful, babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb."
00:56:01 - 00:57:08 (67 sec),"Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security. Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military -- with $700 billion dollars last year and $716 billion dollars this year."
00:57:08 - 00:58:19 (71 sec),"We are also getting other nationsto pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO -- but now we have secured a $100 billion dollar increase in defense spending from NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System."
00:58:19 - 00:58:54 (36 sec),"Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms."
00:58:54 - 01:00:03 (69 sec),"That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't -- in which case,we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula."
01:00:03 - 01:00:41 (38 sec),"Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one."
01:00:41 - 01:01:50 (69 sec),"Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Gwydo. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom -- and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair."
01:01:50 - 01:02:36 (46 sec),"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence -- not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
01:02:36 - 01:03:32 (57 sec),"One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism -- not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel -- and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem."
01:03:32 - 01:04:28 (55 sec),"Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American Heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion dollars in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach."
01:04:28 - 01:05:31 (63 sec),"Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home."
01:05:31 - 01:06:37 (66 sec),"I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor -- and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban."
01:06:37 - 01:07:32 (55 sec),"As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people."
01:07:32 - 01:08:23 (51 sec),"18 years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole -- and last month American Forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole."
01:08:23 - 01:09:33 (70 sec),"My administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country."
01:09:33 - 01:10:33 (60 sec),"We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants Death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish People. We must never ignore the vile poison of Anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an Anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh."
01:10:33 - 01:12:02 (88 sec),SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery -- but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.
01:12:02 - 01:13:56 (114 sec),"He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall -- more than 7 decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp."
01:13:56 - 01:15:03 (67 sec),"Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: ""It's the Americans."" A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau [Dah-kow] Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks."
01:15:03 - 01:16:26 (83 sec),"To me, Joshua recalls, ""the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky."" I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchick. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the Beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American Soldiers who helped liberate Dachau [Dah-kow]. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth."
01:16:26 - 01:17:47 (81 sec),"Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight -- seated side-by-side, here in the home of American Freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation. Very much appreciated. Thank you very much. Thank you. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war."
01:17:47 - 01:18:44 (57 sec),"They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America -- they did it for us. Everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before."
01:18:44 - 01:19:41 (57 sec),"Think of this Capitol -- think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure Civil Rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent Republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California."
01:19:41 - 01:20:24 (43 sec),"Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come."
01:20:24 - 01:21:00 (35 sec),We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our inheritance -- or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.
01:21:00 - 01:21:37 (38 sec),"This is the time to re-ignite the American Imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future -- our fate -- and our choice to make."
01:21:37 - 01:22:24 (47 sec),"I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep Freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's Destiny -- that One Nation, Under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world."
01:22:24 - 01:22:45 (21 sec),"Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and Goodnight."
00:00:00 - 00:00:26 (27 sec),"Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, Kevin. Do we love Kevin? Wow, what a job. What a job. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Where is Kevin sitting? He's around here someplace. Kevin, Thank you. Collects so much money. What do you say $23 -- $23 million? That's not bad. I mean, you are the minority, I hate to say."
00:00:26 - 00:00:48 (22 sec),"That's not going to last long, I don't think. That's not going to last long. It was just a brief little spell. You wanted to take a little break. You shouldn't have done it. I told you that. Don't worry, they blame me. I say, ""What the hell did I have to do with it?"" They said, ""Trump wasn't running."" But you know what?"
00:00:48 - 00:01:13 (25 sec),"We're going to do great. I really believe it. We're going to do great. We're going to take the House back. We are. I feel totally confident about that. We're going to watch those vote tallies. You know, I keep hearing about the election and the -- the various counting measures that they have. There were a lot of close elections that were -- they seemed to, every single one of them went Democrat."
00:01:13 - 00:01:35 (21 sec),"If it was close they say, ""The Democrat -- "" Well, there's something going on -- you got to -- hey, you got to be a little bit more paranoid than you are. Okay. Look, all these beautiful people. These beautiful Republican congressmen and women. But we have to be a little bit careful because I don't like the way the votes are being tallied."
00:01:35 - 00:02:07 (32 sec),"I don't like it and you don't like it either. You just don't want to say it because you're afraid of the press. You're afraid of the press. But we have to be careful. And I have to tell you, though, that this is my third one of these and this is really something. It's thrilling to be here tonight with my many great friends and fellow patriots to support incredible Republican members of Congress -- and you are incredible and you've gone through a lot and you're tougher and stronger than ever."
00:02:07 - 00:02:30 (23 sec),"And I'll tell you, I have never been more unified with you than I am right now for some reason. I don't know what it is. It's true. You helped us on the border, which turned out that you're right on that one. That was when it was a little bit less in vogue than it is today. Now everybody's saying, ""I told you there was an emergency."" But you were there right from the beginning."
00:02:30 - 00:02:49 (18 sec),"I appreciate it. I -- I really mean it. I don't think I've ever been closer to you folks, the people in this room, than I am right now, more so than I was even a year ago -- and it was pretty good then, too. But you're fighting every day for our citizens, our safety, our rights, and our God given freedom."
00:02:49 - 00:03:15 (26 sec),"I especially want to thank the rest of this terrific House Republican leadership team, including Republican Whip, the bravest man in this room, a man who played second base in a game where a shot was hit to him. He had zero range. You know, the Yankees had a guy Bobby Richardson, they say he had the widest range of anybody."
00:03:15 - 00:03:41 (26 sec),"He could get a ball anywhere. Go back to shortstop. He was a second baseman. He had the greatest range of everybody. Steve Scalise had the least range of anybody in the history of second base. And I watched that game and I said, ""Oh, my God, look,"" a shot was hit to second. It was hit hard. A really hard ground ball and he got down, he blocked that sucker."
00:03:41 - 00:04:04 (23 sec),"He then picked it up and he threw it to first. I said, ""Is this a movie we're watching?"" The first pitch and Steve Scalise. And let me tell you, Steve Scalise has courage. I was with him that night and his incredible family, his wife, and he wasn't looking so good. And in a short while -- and the doctor said he wasn't looking so good."
00:04:04 - 00:04:45 (41 sec),"It wasn't such a great prognosis. And I'll tell you what, he fights better than anybody and he's my friend and he's your friend. Steve's Scalise. Where is Steve? Where is Steve? Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Steve. Great guy. I'm glad you're on our side, Steve. Okay. And thank you very much and congratulations and to your family."
00:04:45 - 00:05:13 (28 sec),"Amazing what's happened with you. A person who is tough and smart and somebody that fought very hard, loyal. I did something for a man named Scooter Libby, who was not treated fairly in the eyes of many. I've heard this for many years, was not treated fairly. And Liz and her father -- and they came out early for me. Actually, her father came out like almost immediately for me, and it was interesting because I didn't know him."
00:05:13 - 00:05:29 (16 sec),"I liked him, I respected him, but I didn't know him really. But he came out very early. It was a very important moment, actually, for me because who the hell was supporting me? Everyone thought I was just playing games, right? They said, ""He doesn't really mean this. He's just having fun."" You call this fun?"
00:05:29 - 00:05:55 (26 sec),"It's fun. You get phony witch hunts and you get all the others. This is a lot of fun, folks. Have a good time. ""Have a good time, Donald,"" as I wave goodbye to Fifth Avenue. Great time. But I am having a great time because we're doing a lot. We're doing more than anyone's ever done in a short period of time."
00:05:55 - 00:06:21 (26 sec),"We're doing it together. And I am having a good time -- because we're producing for people. But Liz Cheney was so dedicated and -- and the loyalty. That was just an honor for me to do it because we want to take care of our people that got hurt, our people that got wounded. They got wounded. Just like Steve got wounded."
00:06:21 - 00:06:44 (24 sec),"This was a different kind of a wound. And we took care of them. And she was so happy and her father was so happy because they don't forget. Those are good people. So, Liz, thank you very much. Where is Liz? Where is Liz? Thank you, Liz. I mean that, too. Dedicated. It's called loyal people. We like loyal people."
00:06:44 - 00:07:06 (21 sec),"And our -- and our NRCC chair, Tom Emmer. Tom. Thank you, Tom. Great job. I watched him speaking from back, they have a beautiful camera setup and I looked at my people I said, ""This guy's like central casting."" You couldn't pick a better guy in Hollywood. There's no actor that could do it better. Really, thank you, Tom."
00:07:06 - 00:07:28 (22 sec),"Thank you for the great job more importantly. And a special thanks to the chair of this evening's dinner -- and I've agreed to go to the Caterpillar place where they make those beautiful D10s. I said, ""Are they making the D12 yet?"" ""No, they make that in a different location."" I said, ""Well, Darin, I want to go there then."
00:07:28 - 00:08:04 (37 sec),"I want to see what a D12 looks like."" But we're going, no, we're going to Caterpillar. We'll be there soon. And that's a great company and Darin LaHood does a fantastic job of representing that area. They love him. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be there with Darin. I'll be there. Finally, to all of our wonderful supporters here tonight who pour your time, your energy, your resources, and your heart into defending our great nation, your commitment has never been more important than it is right now and we thank you."
00:08:04 - 00:08:26 (21 sec),"And we are, all together, putting America First. Something you haven't heard for many, many decades, America First. We're putting America First. That's what we're doing. And you see that in our deal with China. you're going to see that in a lot of different things. They're all coming online right now. You're seeing it in a lot of different ways."
00:08:26 - 00:08:47 (22 sec),"It's amazing. You know, we ran on a theme, ""Make America Great Again"". And a lot of people are saying that may have been the greatest theme ever in politics. I think it is that. And it wasn't -- Ronald Reagan had a small thing called, ""Let's Make America Great"". That was good. I don't like it as much. And he sure as hell didn't use it as much."
00:08:47 - 00:09:08 (20 sec),"We had -- we've sold millions and millions of hats. Now you go to a rally everybody has the red hat ""Make America Great Again"". Maybe I can have a little help from you. So we have to make a decision pretty soon because we've done a lot for the country. The stock market's up almost 50 percent. We've gotten rid of the great regulations."
00:09:08 - 00:09:34 (26 sec),"Kevin and everybody have told you -- and the great tax cuts with the legendary Kevin Brady and his group. And we've done all of these things. Where is Kevin? I was actually going to introduce him later, but I'll introduce him right now. Where's Kevin? Thank you, Kevin. What a job this man's done. What a job he's done."
00:09:34 - 00:09:58 (25 sec),"Thank you, Kevin. You really have. But we have to make a decision -- the theme for the next campaign. So we've been here by that time three, three and a half years, we're going into the war with some socialists. And it looks like the only non-sort of heavy Socialist he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists."
00:09:58 - 00:10:23 (25 sec),"They got to him. Our former vice president. He's -- I was going to call him, I don't know him well, I was going to say, ""Welcome to the world, Joe. Are you having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?"" But we're going to be running against somebody that's going to go as far left as possible. They're going to go out there."
00:10:23 - 00:10:48 (25 sec),"And so we have to come up -- do we say it seriously, let me know, do we say, ""Keep America Great?"" My theme was going to be ""Keep America Great"" because we've made it great. And we really have. I mean, we -- China is down 38 percent, Kevin, because of tariffs, okay. See, look at Kevin. You're not unhappy about that."
00:10:48 - 00:11:10 (22 sec),"And we're up 50 percent. And the world is not doing well. Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing well. But we're doing well. We're setting records. We should have another record very shortly in the stock market. I think we have 22 Records, 22, where the stock market hit new highs, 22, 100 percent hours."
00:11:10 - 00:11:26 (16 sec),"We have everyone, 22. And now we're going to have another one it looks like. It was looking a little bit bleaker two or three months ago, but that was artificial, it was artificially caused. But it looks like we're going to have some more. We're going to have a lot more. But I have to decide, do we make a change in the theme?"
00:11:26 - 00:12:00 (34 sec),"So you'll tell me because you'll clap. So we have the greatest theme, I think, really of all time, ""Make America Great Again. ""MAGA"". ""MAGA"". ""MAGA Country"", right? MAGA County. How about the guy from Chicago? The actor that nobody ever heard of, nobody ever -- I said, ""Who the hell is that?"" He said, ""He got taken out by MAGA Country."" I said, ""What the hell was that?"" I guess that's a hate crime, right?"
00:12:00 - 00:12:25 (26 sec),"He got taken out by MAGA Country. But we have ""MAGA"" and we do have ""MAGA Country"". We have people that are so in love with us. We have the greatest base, I believe, in the history of politics or I wouldn't be here. With all the things I've done they never wavered. They never wavered. Can you believe? Anybody else they'd be down to 2 percent right now, and we just had our best -- we just had 51 percent and 54 percent."
00:12:25 - 00:12:57 (31 sec),"And they say you can add 10 percent -- because 10 percent of the people love us, but they're ashamed to say, ""That I'm voting for the president."" I don't care, they're ashamed. And I said, ""Am I supposed to like that?"" I do. We'll take it any way we can get it, right, fellas? Anyway, we can get it. Actually in the one poll, and we have some great pollsters unless it work for CNN, that -- those are -- that's fake news."
00:12:57 - 00:13:24 (27 sec),"You know, polls can be fake news, too. But we have one poll where the pollster said, ""Anybody that says, 'I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to tell you. I don't want to even discuss it -- '"" And they also added another two words, when they call up and they say these two horrible words -- anybody in that category it's a 100 percent vote for Trump."
00:13:24 - 00:13:45 (21 sec),"And what they've done is they don't count that. But now this one counts that, it's 100 percent. We're going to have a great election. The question is, do I go with ""Make America Great Again"" or do I go with ""Keep America Great"" because we made it great in theory. So are you ready? Let's go. Let me hear it. And -- and it is hard."
00:13:45 - 00:14:04 (18 sec),"You know, I was seeing the other day, they were saying it's -- it's probably the greatest theme in the history of politics. I think it is, ""Make America Great Again, MAGA"". How do you give that up for a new one? ""KAG"". ""KAG"". ""Keep America Great. KAG"". I don't know. Maybe it catches on. You never know. You know what?"
00:14:04 - 00:14:42 (38 sec),"First with MAGA I never thought MAGA was going to catch on. And now MAGA, everything's MAGA. I even say just whenever I do a tweet, that's -- boy that has kept us in business, those tweets, huh? Haven't they? It's my only form of defense because the press is 94 percent against us, 94 percent. So, who likes ""Make America Great Again""? And you people are pros, most of you, not all of you."
00:14:42 - 00:15:25 (43 sec),"I see a couple of people I know they have not done well in this business. In fact, they're sitting outside of those doors trying to get in. Who likes ""Keep America Great""? Okay, so ready? ""Make America Great Again"". Or ""Keep America Great"". I don't know. It's -- it's, honestly, I love the idea of ""Keep America Great"" because you know what it says is we've made it great now we're going to keep it great because the Socialists will destroy it. You know, we're doing great but they can destroy what we've done with the steel industry."
00:15:25 - 00:15:49 (24 sec),"Look at what's going on with the steel industry in your district, also, by the way, along with Caterpillar, they're building steel mills, 38 steel mills all over the land, renovation and -- and a lot of new ones. A lot of new ones. Because we decided to put the tariffs on dumped steel, mostly from China, what it's done is beyond anybody's -- it's like one of the hot -- hot things."
00:15:49 - 00:16:06 (17 sec),"And by the way, this country needs steel. We've got to have steel. You know, there are certain things you don't have to have, like, you know, making the suit, you don't have to have, you have to have steel. We need it for defense. You have to have aluminum. And it's incredible what happened to those industries."
00:16:06 - 00:16:26 (20 sec),"So we will make the determination. And honestly, I get a good vibe on both, to be honest. I love the concept. We made it great and now we're going to keep it great, but I hate the concept of throwing away the most successful theme, I think, probably in the history politics. I mean, there's something a little stupid about that, right?"
00:16:26 - 00:16:48 (22 sec),"Let's take MAGA and throw it out. So I have a feeling we maybe we'll try and use both. How about that? We'll try and use both because they're both good. You know. Hillary had a thing like ""Stay Together"" or some crap like that. I think she paid $1.9 million for the genius that gave her the line. I can honestly tell you I didn't pay."
00:16:48 - 00:17:11 (23 sec),"That was made up by me. That was made up by me. But they paid a lot of money. And then the first night, remember, we said, ""It's all about her,"" and then changed the theme the next morning. So that didn't work out too well. Her theme wasn't too good. It wasn't a success. But after two years of Republican leadership, and -- and I have to tell you, we are truly winning again."
00:17:11 - 00:17:35 (24 sec),"Our country is winning again and our country is respected again. And it's, I say, respected like rarely before and we're hitting a new mark. But I say it's respected like rarely before. And with your help, we're restoring the bonds of loyalty and trust between our citizens and their government and we're returning power to where it belongs, with the American people."
00:17:35 - 00:18:09 (35 sec),"To liberate our citizens from bureaucracy we've slashed almost 30,000 pages of job killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record no matter how long a president was in office. Let me see what I look like, huh? Good. I don't see much of a bald spot there. I'm very -- I'm always afraid to look in those cameras."
00:18:09 - 00:18:30 (21 sec),"And again, I want to thank -- and -- and he is a special man. He's a friend of mine, but -- And I introduced him a little earlier, but I'm going to introduce them again because Kevin Brady, and so many of the other fantastic Republicans that passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country and they're for the working families."
00:18:30 - 00:18:52 (22 sec),"We don't get credit for the working families part, but it's the largest tax cuts. And businesses are flowing back into our country because of those tax cuts and because of regulation cuts. So Kevin, again, thank you very much. Really an incredible job. Thank you to everybody that worked with all of us, you know that right?"
00:18:52 - 00:19:14 (22 sec),"We doubled the Child Tax Credit and we virtually ended the unfair Estate Tax, also known as the Death Tax on small businesses and farms. I tell people when I'm in farm country, I said, ""You know, now if you have a farm -- ,"" they used to leave it and the kids would have to go out and borrow a lot of money because they make an income but it's hard."
00:19:14 - 00:19:33 (19 sec),The land is sometimes worth more than the income. And they go borrow money at the end up losing it to a bank a couple of years later. It's -- -not going to be worried about any longer. Now they don't have the Death Tax. They don't have what's known as the Estate Tax. We got rid of it. Kevin did that with a whole group of very good people.
00:19:33 - 00:19:57 (24 sec),"And that's a big deal. That's a big deal. People are very happy. I always say, jokingly, ""So now if you love your children you can leave your farm or your small business to your children and they don't have to go borrow money and take a risk. If you don't leave your children -- if you don't love them, if you don't just really love them it doesn't matter because you're not going to leave it to them anyway."
00:19:57 - 00:20:22 (25 sec),"So this tax doesn't mean a damn thing. This tax won't help you much."" But most of them leave it to their children, I guess. To bring back American jobs we slashed the business tax rate down from one of the highest anywhere in the developed world, down to a number that nobody believed that we could get down to. We were at, if you really add it up, we were over 40 percent."
00:20:22 - 00:20:46 (25 sec),"It was an impossible situation. And you know, so many things are in that deal like bringing back money. Billions and billions of dollars is pouring back into a country that could not get back here. It was impossible, not only because of the high tax rates, nobody would bring it back -- over 40 percent, but also because of the bureaucracy which we killed in our tax plan."
00:20:46 - 00:21:10 (24 sec),"So billions of dollars. Apple recently announced $230 billion is going to be brought back into our country from overseas that they would never have even thought of bringing back and they're going to spend it building new facilities here. That's a lot, $230 billion. And we're fixing broken trade deals to protect the American workers."
00:21:10 - 00:21:29 (19 sec),"And we are standing up to China's chronic trading abuses and theft of intellectual properties and so many other things that they've done to us. I don't know how you people allowed this to happen for so many years. You've been here longer than me. But they really have, they've taken advantage of our country."
00:21:29 - 00:21:49 (20 sec),"And you know what? I respect them for it. I say it. We should have been doing that to them. I was in China making a speech. President Xi, who is a strong man, I call him King, he said, ""But I am not King, I am president."" I said, ""No, you're president for life and therefore, you're King."" He said, ""Huh. Huh."" He liked that."
00:21:49 - 00:22:11 (22 sec),"So I call him King. I get along with them great. But I was really hitting him hard about how they've hurt our country. And I had 5,000 Chinese people, I'm China, I'm in Beijing doing this, can you believe it? And I'm looking down, he's getting angrier and angrier. And then I saved it. I said, ""You know, I don't blame you."
00:22:11 - 00:22:38 (27 sec),"I blame the leaders of our country for allowing it to happen."" And it's really true. We should never have allowed that to happen. And we're getting a lot of it back. You're going to see it. And your farmers, all of you representing farm territory -- You know, I was with the Vice Premier about two weeks ago, and I said, ""You got to do me a favor of goodwill,"" because we have such a strong country right now, economically, stronger than anybody by far."
00:22:38 - 00:22:55 (17 sec),"You know, they were catching us. They would have -- they would have caught us within a short period of time. They we're catching us. Within two years, by the end of my term, if you had a normal president, I don't want to say that negatively, I think I'm very normal, but if you had a normal -- you know what I mean."
00:22:55 - 00:23:16 (21 sec),"In other words, if you had a stiff as president -- which most of them are, I hate to say -- they would have caught us. But right now it's going to be a long time before they catch us. A long time. I told you, they're down 38 percent, we're up 50 percent. That made a lot of difference. It's like day and night."
00:23:16 - 00:23:44 (28 sec),"But we really have to be strong with these nations because these nations are taking advantage, not just China, everybody has a trade surplus on us -- almost every nation in the world. When I took over we lost eight -- I said, ""How are we doing on trade? I want to break down,"" my first meeting. They said, ""Sir, we're down $807 billion."" I said, ""You got to be kidding?"" No, seriously, I thought they were joking, right?"
00:23:44 - 00:24:08 (24 sec),"We were down $807. We're losing over $800 billion in trade. We're starting to turn it. We have the USMCA. I hope you guys can get it approved. I mean, the problem we have -- is that you have a very hostile group. You have a very, very hostile group on the other side, and they don't want to see us have success and the USMCA is a great deal."
00:24:08 - 00:24:30 (22 sec),"It's great. Again, I said, ""If you don't do this we're going to tariff every product coming out of your country at 25 percent."" And every time I had a problem I would just take -- you know, especially cars. I had a little plastic car on my desk and I'd have the leaders come over and I just take the car out, put it on the front of the desk, they say, ""Okay, we agree."" Because the big thing is the cars."
00:24:30 - 00:24:55 (25 sec),"Canada's sending us tremendous numbers of cars. They're practically un-taxed, and yet they don't take our agricultural product, in many cases, and in many cases they charge 297 percent tariffs and it's very unfair. Canada's very, very tough. You know, we love Canada. We think of the beautiful song and the ice hockey games, Oh, Canada, isn't it beautiful?"
00:24:55 - 00:25:23 (28 sec),"But in the meantime, they knock the hell out of us on trade and they have been doing it for a long time. And they're very tough. And they're not at all nice about that situation. But we've made them nice. We've made them nice. And they're not happy about what happened. But our farmers are going to be able to sell now into Canada, which they were restricted from doing and -- and they're going to be able to sell into a lot of places."
00:25:23 - 00:25:50 (27 sec),"And the Vice Premier said when I said, ""Give us a token of affection."" He said, ""We will immediately by 10 million tons of soybeans."" And I looked at Sonny Perdue, who's doing a fantastic job, as you know, Secretary of Agriculture -- I said, ""Sonny, is 10 million tons of soybeans a lot? It sounds -- "" He said, ""That's a lot."" And they started buying 10 million."
00:25:50 - 00:26:22 (32 sec),"So the farmers are so incredible -- and I saw them interviewed last week. They had a couple of farmers on. We love the farmers. I'll tell you. I'm never going to forget the farmers. They -- they sort of got me here, wouldn't you think? And they said, ""Well, you know -- "" because China and various of these countries that were rightfully doing numbers on them because we have no choice what they've done to us. But they're going to start buying at numbers that you've never seen before."
00:26:22 - 00:26:43 (21 sec),"But farmers said, ""We know how badly China has taken advantage of this country. And we may be getting a little bit hurt right now but we're with the president all the way."" They have every single farmer, every person I've seen they have these focus groups, every farmer has said the same thing. And you know, the amazing thing about farmers?"
00:26:43 - 00:27:08 (25 sec),"We had a little bit of a soft patch and I called in a group of 15 or 20 representative farmers and I wanted to give them help, I wanted to give them aid. And they looked at me and said, ""We don't want aid. We don't want it."" And I said, ""What do you mean?"" Because I'm so used to having people come in, wanting help, wanting aid, wanting whatever it is they want."
00:27:08 - 00:27:30 (21 sec),"And these people didn't want it. They just wanted me to make a fair platform. And I said, ""I'll never forget this meeting. I will never forget it,"" because again, I meet with a lot of different groups and they're always asking for an advantage. Okay, I'm not blaming anybody. These farmers didn't want it. They said, ""We don't want that, sir."
00:27:30 - 00:27:51 (22 sec),"We don't want any help. We just want a -- really a level playing field."" I thought it was incredible. I've told that story so many times. So we love our farmers. Let them know we're very close, because you are going to have -- In fact, when I asked China -- and I'm doing that, that'll be the end of the -- if we get there and you know, let's see what happens."
00:27:51 - 00:28:14 (22 sec),"Who knows? I think we're doing very well. They need the deal more than we do. You see what's -- they need the deal. And they getting hurt badly with the -- you know, they're paying 25 percent on $50 billion worth of technology stuff and they were going to pay 25 percent on another $200 billion. But I started them at $10 because I'm nice."
00:28:14 - 00:28:52 (38 sec),"And then we were dealing well, this was three, four weeks ago. You remember. And they said, ""Would it be possible for you not to raise the 10 percent to 25 percent?"" which would automatically kick in? I said, ""Yes,"" because you know it's a little hard to negotiate with them when we start raising it. But after that, they have $340 billion left that I haven't even text and their bullets are gone because we do $600 billion worth of purchases from them, and they do $97 billion worth of purchases from us. Not exactly great."
00:28:52 - 00:29:16 (25 sec),"But now they were paying for that. And they were paying big. One thing, as an example, on cars, if they sold a car to us we bring it in for no tax. It's 2.5 percent, but basically, when you do certain paperwork and check the wrong boxes you pay nothing. It's stupid. When we buy a car from them, and we buy a lot of them, believe it or not, it's a 40 percent tax."
00:29:16 - 00:29:34 (18 sec),"So they get 40 percent, we get nothing, other than that it's been a very good deal. I get a call two months ago, toward the beginning of the negotiation, that they're bringing the 40 percent down to 15 percent. I said, ""That's good, but it's still not zero. It's still not what we have."" You know, it's good."
00:29:34 - 00:29:54 (20 sec),"I'm not thrilled. I got a call from -- and but that's coming down. It's all coming down. I got a call from Prime Minister Modi of India. They're one of the highest taxing nations in the world. They taxed us 100 percent. Look, he's nodding, you know what I'm talking about. They charge us 100 percent tariffs on goods."
00:29:54 - 00:30:20 (26 sec),"So they send a motorcycle -- and they make a lot of them -- Indian cycles. They send them to our country, we charge them nothing. We send a Harley Davidson to India and they charge us 100 percent. Not fair, okay. Not reciprocal. It's not fair. And for those of you, like Sean, and like -- where's Sean? Where the hell is my guy from Wisconsin?"
00:30:20 - 00:30:56 (37 sec),"He's so great. Where is he? This guy's a champion. Him and where's Jim? 128 -- 128 and 1. Where the hell is Jim Jordan? Where the hell is he? Is he here? 128. Where is he? This guy, NCAA, What a lousy location. Holy -- are you kidding me? Wait, stand up again. I can't see you. It's too far away. I can't believe it. Wow, Jim, I've just lost all respect for Jim."
00:30:56 - 00:31:17 (20 sec),"That's it. One hundred twenty eight and one in wrestling, NCAA Wrestling Champion. And you know when you're that -- when you're that good, don't kid yourself, folks. A lot of us up here, not just here, a lot of it's right up here. And he's a warrior and Sean's a warrior. And Sean now is working on the Reciprocal Trade Act."
00:31:17 - 00:31:40 (23 sec),"If they charge us, we charge them, very simple. They charge us, we charge them. And I think you're doing great on it, Sean, and I appreciate it, man. Great job. But he's the tree climbing, you know, these characters to go up the trees then they come down. He said, ""No, going up isn't the hard part, it's coming down because if you miss you're dead."" And he said he's missed about four times."
00:31:40 - 00:32:04 (25 sec),"But he's a five time world champion going up a tree. Did anybody know that? See, to me that means something because being a champion is something -- And that's one that is tough stuff and dangerous stuff. So listen, I appreciate your help, Sean. It's incredible. That's incredible. I'm still more impressed with a championship stuff, but that's -- So we've ended the war on American energy."
00:32:04 - 00:32:31 (26 sec),"The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And that all happened over the last two years. Big difference. Hillary wanted to put up wind. Wind. If you -- if you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value."
00:32:31 - 00:32:55 (25 sec),"And they say the noise causes cancer. You told me that one. Okay. You know, the thing makes it -- it's so -- And of course, it's like a graveyard for birds. If you love birds you'd never want to walk under a windmill because it's a very sad, sad sight. It's like a cemetery. We put a little -- we put a little statue for the poor birds."
00:32:55 - 00:33:25 (30 sec),"It's true. You know, in California, if you shoot a Bald Eagle they put you in jail for five years and yet, the windmills wipe them all out. It's true. They wipe them out. It's terrible. And I told the other day at CPAC, great people at CPAC. We had an incredible thing. I had nothing to do. It was early on a Saturday morning I had just gotten back from dealing with Kim Jong-un. We had to walk."
00:33:25 - 00:33:42 (17 sec),"He wasn't ready for deal. That's okay, because we get along great. He wasn't ready. I told him, ""You're not ready for a deal."" That's the first time anybody has ever told him that and left. It's never happened to him before. Nobody's ever left. But I said, ""You're not ready for a deal, but we'll make it deal."" We have a good relationship."
00:33:42 - 00:34:09 (27 sec),"We have a good relationship. But I told a story about CPAC, the woman, she wants to watch television and she says to her husband, ""Is the wind blowing? I'd love to watch your show tonight, darling. The wind hasn't blown for three days. I can't watch television, darling. Darling, please tell the wind to blow."" No, wind's not so good."
00:34:09 - 00:34:25 (16 sec),"And you know, you have no idea how expensive it is to make those things. They're all made in China and Germany, by the way, just in case you -- We don't make them here, essentially. We don't make them here. And by the way, the carbon and all of the things flying up in the air, you know, the carbon footprint?"
00:34:25 - 00:34:54 (29 sec),"President Obama used to talk about the carbon footprint and he'd hop on Air Force One, a big 747 with very old engines, and he'd fly to Hawaii to play a round of golf. Now, you tell me, the carbon footprint. But that's the way it is. We have the greatest energy in the world. They wanted to take it away from us. They don't like that we have it. We've really discovered it over the last very short period of time."
00:34:54 - 00:35:15 (21 sec),"I've made it readily accessible. We're approving pipelines in Texas that would have taken 20 years. I'm getting them done in about six months. You guys all know that the Texas guys. And by the way, if they're not good, if there's something wrong, if it's going to hurt our water, if it's going to hurt our air, if it's going to -- we're not going to approve them."
00:35:15 - 00:35:34 (19 sec),"But you're going to know in 12 months instead of in 20 years, at the end of 20 years you start off as a young man or woman and now you're getting ready to retire and they're getting ready to vote on your project, right, whatever the hell it may be. You know, highways, Elaine Chao is doing a great job, by the way, as our Secretary."
00:35:34 - 00:35:56 (22 sec),"Great job. But highways, in many cases, would take 20 or 21 years to get approved. Think of it. In some cases, not even a highway, it's like a roadway. And I have a down now to two years. We got rid of so much of the waste and the stupidity. And you know, a lot of this happened because of consultants, environmental engineers, they call themselves."
00:35:56 - 00:36:17 (22 sec),"I have -- I've heard many of them. I've lost plenty of money with those guys. And I used to see him up at Albany. I'd say, ""How come you're here? Why are you here? You represent me. Why are you here?"" They're trying to get a bill passed that makes it harder to get permits and my guy is there trying to get the bill because I have to pay them more money that way, my consultant."
00:36:17 - 00:36:47 (30 sec),"So we took down highways from, in many cases 20 years, till probably -- we want to get it down to one year and then maybe get rejected but you'll get it rejected quickly. You're going to know. It's like Jack Nicklaus is a friend of mine. He said standing over a four foot putt, he never missed them, but he told me Chichi Rodriguez, great putter, he get up, he was a character and he'd just putt."
00:36:47 - 00:37:06 (19 sec),"Get up, bing. Get up, bing. It wouldn't take any time. Get up, bing. He had an expression, ""Miss it quick."" You ever hear that expression? He was a character. ""Miss it quick."" I'd get up, ""Miss it quick."" But he didn't miss too many. But that's what we're doing. We're going to make sure that you get it and if it doesn't work we're going to let you know."
00:37:06 - 00:37:36 (30 sec),"There was a highway, a small highway in a state where some friends are in this room. It is 21 years. It was going to cost $5 million 21 years ago. Now it's going to cost $900 million and it took 21 years to get it approved. And it used to be a straight line. Right? So if somebody's a little tipsy, they had too many drinks, which is a bad thing, at least they could drive straight."
00:37:36 - 00:38:03 (27 sec),"Now in order to get away from nesting turtles, rattlesnakes, and everything else, that highway is the craziest looking sucker you've ever seen. It's twice as long as it was supposed to be. My father and I would have designed it a straight path, point to point, right? And but it took -- and it cost, you know, I mean, literally, almost hundreds of times more than it was supposed to cost."
00:38:03 - 00:38:24 (20 sec),"And it's dangerous. People are running into the -- they don't know how, but they're running into things that they're not supposed to. So we're straightening things out. There are many, many stories like that. The great aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, I go to see it and the catapult system, you know, the catapult, that's what's throws the plane off."
00:38:24 - 00:38:47 (23 sec),"So the aircraft carrier, there's a slight problem. It was supposed to cost $3 billion. It ended up costing about $16 billion right now. It wasn't on my watch. But it's getting close. The President Gerald Ford. Big. The largest ship ever built they say. It's a massive ship. So I get on there but they're having trouble with the catapult system because it used to be steam."
00:38:47 - 00:39:13 (25 sec),"You've seen it where the planes go off steam, old-fashioned, right? Old-fashioned. So they've decided to go magnetic -- never been done before -- and electronic. So it's very, very complex. They have these brilliant guys from MIT, where my uncle was a professor, by the way, for 40 years, brilliant guy, Dr. John Trump."
00:39:13 - 00:39:45 (33 sec),"A lot of people find it hard to believe that I had a professor -- one of the smartest people in the history of MIT, in my blood. You'd be surprised. A lot of things are surprising in life. But you have to go to MIT to figure out how this damn thing works. So I get to the boat. ""How's it going?"" ""Well, it's okay, sir, but we're having a little problem with the catapult system."" You know, that's not like so good."
00:39:45 - 00:40:21 (36 sec),"I mean, we have an aircraft carrier and you can't send planes off the damn thing. Historically, that has not proven to be a good thing for aircraft carriers. So -- so I said, ""Let me see -- "" I didn't want to see the admirals. You get tired of the admirals because this was a problem. I said,"" Let me see the catapult people."" They said, ""Sir, you don't really want to do that."" I said, ""Yeah, those are the people that know what the hell they're doing."" This thing is $900 million over budget to throw the planes off."
00:40:21 - 00:40:51 (30 sec),"And we could have had steam and it would have been done and we would have saved hundreds of millions of dollars. So I get the catapult guys, five guys come over. ""Yes, sir."" ""What do you do?"" ""Sir, I've been a catapulter. By the way, he's more proud of being a catapulter than Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady, and all of you big, high ranking Republicans are doing what the hell -- They -- they would be so bored doing what you're doing."
00:40:51 - 00:41:22 (31 sec),"Dealing with Democrats all day. That's not fun. But I said, ""So what do you do?"" He said, ""I'm a catapulter, 20 years. Yes, sir. What would you like to know, sir?"" ""Very simple question. What's better, an electric catapult or steam?"" ""Sir, steam is better."" I said, ""It's better."" I said, ""Why is it better?"" ""Well, for one thing the electric goes faster, sir."
00:41:22 - 00:41:49 (27 sec),"But it takes you two and a half minutes to bring the plane to the site. No matter what you do it's still the same two and a half. So we don't have to send the plane off every second. By the time the steam builds up we have plenty of time left. That's number one, sir. I can give you 10 other reasons but another one, sir, if the steam breaks I can fix it myself with a wrench."
00:41:49 - 00:42:10 (21 sec),"If the electronics breaks, sir, we have to send for Albert Einstein -- to try and fix it. We can't figure this damn thing out."" I never saw -- this is what happens. This is what happens. This is what happens. I hate to say it, when they make airplanes so damn complex that pilots can't fly him this is what happens."
00:42:10 - 00:42:33 (23 sec),"Now, up to a point you want to go. But we have to be careful. We're spending money on things and it's almost like they do it just to do it. And we want to be careful. We want to be smart. So we're getting that problem fixed, but it's a hell of a problem. We've confirmed 53 District Court Judges and 37 Circuit Court Judges -- who are going to interpret the Constitution as written."
00:42:33 - 00:42:52 (20 sec),"Anybody not like that here? Not too many people in this room. I can tell you a lot of people in another room across the way. Along with two outstanding Supreme Court Judges, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and as you know, Brett Kavanaugh -- who was put through a grinder like nobody has ever been put through a grinder."
00:42:52 - 00:43:17 (25 sec),"That was so unfair. That was so unfair. And Congress passed, and I'm very proud of this -- where's Greg? Greg. Greg, where are you? We worked hard on this. Greg. Greg. Right. You know what I'm going to say, Greg, because this is a great thing and I hope nobody in this room has to do it. But you know, Right to Choose."
00:43:17 - 00:43:47 (30 sec),"Right. Right. We have a right, a right. And we did something else with Greg and with everybody, we passed Choice for our military, Choice. So we have in one case, Choice, we have another, Right To Try. And I don't know if the people know what even Right To Try -- I kept saying to myself, as I was a civilian -- you don't want to use it. You don't want to use it. But I've had friends over the years, they're very ill, terminally ill."
00:43:47 - 00:44:10 (23 sec),"And if they have money they travel all over the world looking for a cure. If they don't have money they go home and there's nothing they can do. And Right To Try, which Greg and everybody was so incredible with, and we got it done, right? That was an easy. You'd think it was easy. But you know, the country had a problem because they didn't want to be sued if it doesn't work."
00:44:10 - 00:44:41 (30 sec),"The insurance companies had a problem. The drug companies had a problem because they didn't want it on their record. So we said, ""Well, I'll tell you what, we won't put these people that are so terminally ill, so sick, we won't put them on the record."" They said, ""We like that. We have a separate category."
00:44:41 - 00:45:19 (39 sec),"We like that."" And then the insurance companies had a tremendous problem. But the country did too, so I said, ""Here's what we do, they have to sign a document that exculps, that gets rid of all liability to our country. Because you know, they don't make it and then they sue our country. And I could never understand why they didn't get this passed because the law was we don't want to hurt people."
00:45:19 - 00:45:59 (40 sec),"So we don't want to give them a cure. We don't want to hurt people. And I'll tell you what, and for all of the people in this room, and every one of you who's here, you can feel proud because we have had such success. We have saved lives already and this is only seven months ago that we signed it. We've saved lives already with people going -- and what it does, is it really does, I mean, it's the ultimate test for a drug or for a possible cure."
00:45:59 - 00:46:28 (29 sec),"What's better than this? It's been a tremendous success and we got it done. It's something nobody talks about, but it's something that a lot of people respect -- and it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy. So thank you, Greg. That was a great job on that. And we pass VA Accountability. So not only VA Choice. VA Choice."
00:46:28 - 00:47:00 (32 sec),"They're standing in line for weeks and weeks in many cases, weeks and weeks, think of it. And now, rather -- these are great veterans. They stand on line, and now they go, they see a doctor, we pay for it. It doesn't matter. Number one, we do save money. It doesn't matter. We're saving lives. People are ill."
00:47:00 - 00:47:15 (16 sec),"By the time they get to the doctor they are terminally ill. And we're saving lives. But we also have done so many other things for our veterans. And if you notice, there's not a lot of complaints coming out of the VA for the first time. How long has it been since you've seen a VA that's really been well run?"
00:47:15 - 00:47:33 (18 sec),"They're doing a phenomenal job. But Accountability is great, where if they treat our veterans badly -- we have now Accountability. We say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired."" We fire them. You couldn't fire him. They could steal. They could be sadists. They were sadists. They were hurting our veterans."
00:47:33 - 00:47:59 (26 sec),"We couldn't do anything about it. And we also passed, just now, some of you in the room were there with me, a little while ago, criminal justice reform. And I'll tell you, a lot of people are very happy about that. A lot of people. And thanks to our bold agenda, we enacted with House Republicans, America now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
00:47:59 - 00:48:34 (35 sec),"We're the hottest in the world. Wherever I meet a president, a prime minister, anybody, they say, ""Congratulations on your economy."" And since our election, we've created more than 5.3 million new jobs, including half a million jobs and that number is going up to about 618,000 jobs very soon, these are manufacturing jobs that President Obama said will never happen."
00:48:34 - 00:48:58 (24 sec),"""You'd need a magic wand. It's not going to happen. Well, it's happening. We have the magic wand. And more than five million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps because we have jobs, now. Think of that. The numbers are staggering, five million off of foods. And after years of stagnation wages are rising fast and the lowest paid workers are making the biggest gains."
00:48:58 - 00:49:30 (32 sec),"We've done more things than we promised. Many more things. Like this one, African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment, and you know this because you've heard me say it and other people say it, and veteran unemployment, that's a great one, have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:49:30 - 00:49:59 (29 sec),"I mean, how do you beat that? When they talk about African American and what they want to do, I say, ""Well, I have not much to say, except that we've just hit the absolute lowest unemployment rate for African Americans in the history of our country. That's all I have to say. Goodbye, everybody."" We won the debate, right?"
00:49:59 - 00:50:21 (22 sec),"We won the debate. It should be easy. It will be interesting to see. But don't underestimate the power of Socialism to get a vote. It's what happens over a 10-year period when the country is destroyed -- but they don't care about that. When they say, ""We're going to give you a free education. We're going to give you free health care."
00:50:21 - 00:50:45 (24 sec),"We're going to not have you pay your loans for college. We're going to give you free everything. Everything is free,"" it's very seductive to people. It's not going to be so easy like you think. Now, in 10 years it's going to be easy when the country goes to hell because that's what happens, the country goes to hell."
00:50:45 - 00:51:12 (27 sec),"It happened many times. Look at Venezuela. I mean, this was the richest country in that whole -- I mean, outside of us, it was one of the richest countries in the world and now they have no food, they have no electric, they have nothing. It's sad. And that's Socialism. But when you're standing up on a stage, and a guy said, ""We're going to wipe out all costs for education."
00:51:12 - 00:51:40 (29 sec),"We're going to wipe out all healthcare. We're going to give you single payer."" They don't say that you're going to wipe out 180 private plans that people love. But it's not as easy as people think. People think it's easy. It is easy in 10 years, it's not easy now, because a lot of folks are going to say, ""Hey, wait a minute, man, if I vote for Trump, I agree the economy is good, but this guy's giving me everything."" Not that easy."
00:51:40 - 00:52:04 (23 sec),"So we have to work. We can never take it for granted. We have to explain how bad it really is. We have to do that. But this is a time of extraordinary opportunity for our nation, extraordinary. That's why, in my State of the Union Address, I asked new Democrat majority in the House to work with us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure."
00:52:04 - 00:52:22 (19 sec),"And I think we're going to have something, maybe, we could do it bipartisan there, bring down the cost of healthcare, and bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Bring down the cost. Thank you. I love that you're clapping for that because we have to talk quickly about health care to have this power in this room."
00:52:22 - 00:52:49 (27 sec),"How often do you get that? And we are going to finally secure our nation's borders. It's happening right now. And I said to Mexico last week -- you know, they have the strongest immigration laws in the world. They don't have judges. Somebody gets on their land, they say, ""Get out of here, now."" Somebody touches our land, we bring them into court, you need Perry Mason to represent them."
00:52:49 - 00:53:09 (20 sec),"They're here for years. They never come back for the trial. They say, ""Let's bring them into court. We'll bring them in. Well, you just stepped on a property. Bring them in. Be gentle. Bring them into court."" And it's called Catch and Release. It may be the dumbest program in the history of the world. You catch them and you release them."
00:53:09 - 00:53:28 (19 sec),"Oh, wonderful. We've done a great job. And then, ""You're going to come back, sir, in four years from now. January 14th, you're going to come back and we're going to give you a trial to see whether or not you can stay. But in the meantime, we're releasing you into our country."" Now, only two percent come back for the trial."
00:53:28 - 00:53:49 (21 sec),"Okay. And those are not the smartest ones, to be honest with you. The ones that come back or not the smartest ones. The 98 percent are much more than the two percent that come back. It's terrible. But I said to Mexico, ""Listen, you have the strongest immigration."" They don't have courts. They don't have Catch and Release."
00:53:49 - 00:54:10 (21 sec),"They don't have Chain Migration. They don't have Visa Lottery, a lottery. You pick a lottery. ""Oh, you're going to the United States. Congratulations."" The country does this. Do you think they put their best people in those lotteries? What the hell were you people thinking when you approved these deals? They say in all fairness, it is purely -- that's a Chuck Schumer deal."
00:54:10 - 00:54:31 (21 sec),"That was when they had enough muscle. They got this stuff passed. It's incredible. Think of it. They put names and you pick a name. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to announce so and so,"" I don't want to use names because I'll get in trouble because it's always somebody going to leak this whole damn speech to the media -- to the Fake News so I won't use the name that I'm thinking about."
00:54:31 - 00:54:57 (25 sec),"Congratulations. And then you find out he's a stone cold killer, served many years in -- These are the people they give us. What do you think? Do you think they're going to give us their finest? They don't give us -- and we take them in, ""Congratulations."" Crazy CNN, they had a reporter, they're walking up -- I mean, how bad -- I mean, how bad."
00:54:57 - 00:55:17 (21 sec),"Now they're saying, ""We were never against him with respect to collusion. We were just reporting the news."" Did you see that? That's their new theory? You know, that they weren't -- in other words, that they will fair. Yeah, they were fair. But they're interviewing this group of people, ""And what are you coming to the United States for?"" A woman says, ""Well, I'm coming for my daughter."" ""Okay, that's fair."
00:55:17 - 00:55:45 (27 sec),"What are you coming -- "" Then they go to this man, a little rough looking, ""And what are you coming for?"" ""Asylum."" ""Ah. Why?"" ""I murdered someone."" ""Oh."" The woman goes like, ""What? You murdered."" Did anybody see that? ""I murdered someone,"" he said. Right? You saw it. And she's like, ""Oh, man. Okay, back to headquarters, please."" You know, because they're trying to say how good everybody is, that these are wonderful people."
00:55:45 - 00:56:19 (35 sec),"And some of them are wonderful people. Remember when I made my first feature in Trump Tower coming down the escalator with our great First Lady that everybody loves? Everybody loves our First Lady. And I talked about different things. And I mentioned the word rape. And everybody thought it was a great speech and then about two days later, it was like sort of a delayed reaction, two days later, they said, ""He said rape! He said all sorts of -- "" Let me tell you, and I took heat."
00:56:19 - 00:56:43 (24 sec),"Do you remember the first six months? Man were they killing me in that speech. It went from being a great speech to being a disaster. And now you look at that speech and you see what's happening and that speech was so tame compared to what really is happening. That trek up from Guatemala, and Honduras, and El Salvador, it's one of the great, dangerous treks anywhere."
00:56:43 - 00:57:13 (30 sec),"And Mexico has now, because they don't want the border closed, because Mexico makes a hell of a lot of money off us. They took 30 percent of our car business. I wasn't here. The new USMCA will stop that. No more car companies are going to Mexico when they sign this deal. No more car companies. That was the most important thing for me. So now, Mexico, I said I'm closing it and I really wanted to close it, but now Mexico is saying, ""No, no, no."" The first time in decades."
00:57:13 - 00:57:32 (19 sec),"We will not let anybody get through. And they've apprehended over 1,000 people today at the -- at the Southern border, their Southern border, and they're bringing it back into their country. I said, ""Why the hell didn't somebody do that in the first place?"" But they don't want the border closed. And you know who else doesn't want the border closed, the Democrats?"
00:57:32 - 00:58:02 (30 sec),"They don't want the border closed. And I agree, it's going to be a big toll. But trade, and commerce, and making money for our country, it's all very important, but to me the most important job I have is the security of our country, even more important than those other things that I talk about all the time -- it's the security of our country."
00:58:02 - 00:58:28 (25 sec),"Instead of choosing greatness for America, House Democrats responded with radicalism, resistance. ""Resist"", that's their theme. ""Make America Great Again"" is ours, theirs is ""Resist"". You don't know what the hell they're resisting. They go around saying, ""Resist,"" and they do resist. Revenge, crazy hoaxes like we just went through, and ridiculous conspiracy theories."
00:58:28 - 00:59:12 (44 sec),"We have -- just incredible when you see what is coming out. And while Republicans are working every day to empower the American people, the Democratic agenda is all about themselves. That's all they think about is themselves. Okay? It's a disgrace what's going on. It's a disgrace. I said to somebody that's been here a long time, you people would know better than anybody, some of you that have been here, ""Has it ever been this bad?"" And they said, ""Well,"" they said, ""Yes, it was."" They said, ""During the Clinton impeachment hearings it was worse."" They said, ""There was another time in the 1880s when it was worse."" A couple of people were shot, you know."
00:59:12 - 00:59:33 (21 sec),"Even new people wouldn't do that. And the Civil War, who could forget? I would say the Civil War was bad. And by the way, speaking of the Civil War, where is Doug Collins? You're another warrior? Where's Doug Collins? Where the hell is Doug? Man, he's up there fighting. Doug. Thank you, Doug. Warrior. Where's Mark Meadows, another warrior?"
00:59:33 - 01:00:00 (27 sec),"Where's Mark Meadows? What the hell is -- Oh, don't tell me he's got one of those bad seats. Are you with Jim Jordan? That's the Freedom Caucus. What the hell happened to you guys? They're great guys. They are. Everybody in this room as far as I'm concerned. Nearly 100 House Democrats are promoting the biggest Socialist takeover in U.S. history."
01:00:00 - 01:00:24 (24 sec),"That's what's happening. The Green New Deal, it'll cost $100 trillion. Nobody has any idea what that means, $100 trillion. I have wealthy friends they say, ""Write out $1 trillion."" They have no idea. They just keep going. They say, ""Nobody has any idea."" The Democrats are also proposing a massive government takeover of healthcare that would ban private health insurance."
01:00:24 - 01:00:54 (30 sec),"And that's a tremendous thing for us to run on. Because people want -- we have 180 million people that want that. The Democratic plan would destroy American healthcare, bankrupt our country, oh, forget it, not even close, and take away your private doctors. Now, I'm only afraid that we're going to be too hard on the Green New Deal and they're not going to do it, because I want them to do it. We don't want to have them knock it out before we get to run against it so let's take it easy."
01:00:54 - 01:01:31 (37 sec),"I'm -- I'm actually saying, ""It's a wonderful thing."" The Green New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29-years -- old. A young bartender, wonderful young woman, the Green New Deal. You know, but it's crazy. You know, the first time I heard I said, ""That's the craziest thing."" You have senators that are professionals that you guys know that have been there for a long time, white hair, everything perfect, and they're standing behind her and they're shaking, they're petrified of her, ""We support the Green New Deal."" How about the woman from Hawaii, the senator from Hawaii -- highly nice woman, right?"
01:01:31 - 01:01:58 (27 sec),"Oh, I'm glad I didn't say it. I'm going to get great points from my wife for not saying that -- but she was so angry to men, right? Remember, she was screaming at men? And -- and then they asked her about the Green New Deal. ""I love it."" They said, ""Yeah, but you don't allow airplanes anymore so you can't get to Hawaii."" ""Oh, we have to work on something."" So somebody jokingly said, ""We'll build a train to Hawaii,"" and she actually thought it was a decent idea."
01:01:58 - 01:02:23 (24 sec),"So now she supports it because she thinks they're going to build a train to Hawaii. But they really believe this stuff. And you know, it's like, it's the craziest thing. They believe it. And we will have to do something but don't do it too early, please. Don't kill it because we want to be able to run against it. If they beat me with the Green New Deal I deserve to lose."
01:02:23 - 01:02:50 (27 sec),"It's true. And just to finish up, and -- and this is so important, and -- and you know, I'm doing this almost as let's get together and talk because we have to win. We have to take back the House. We have to. There's no reason to have lost it. And what really lost it and really helped us lose it was healthcare because we didn't have an alternative."
01:02:50 - 01:03:07 (17 sec),"We just said, ""Well, let's not talk -- "" Somebody came out the other day, they asked a Republican, two weeks ago, health care and he turned off the mic, ""Well, I'm going home now."" You can't do that. You got to confront it. We'll be the party of healthcare. Republicans should not run away from healthcare."
01:03:07 - 01:03:29 (22 sec),"You can't do it. You're going to get clobbered. And I have an idea and I think it's great. I spoke with Kevin about it. I spoke with a lot of your really top people, smart people, and they love it. I spoke with the Senate about it. I spoke to Mitch. Mitch didn't like it, but then he found out when we're taking the vote, right after the election."
01:03:29 - 01:03:56 (28 sec),"He said, ""Oh, I like that idea."" And I understood why he didn't like it at the beginning because it's been a tough subject. It's been a subject stay away. If we stay away from that subject we're going to lose. We're going to lose. We can't stay away. It's too important. It's too important, because the Democrats -- You know what?"
01:03:56 - 01:04:21 (25 sec),"We have the border. We have, if you look at it, we have the immigration but we have a lot -- we have the crime. We have the police. We have the military. We have so much. They have health care right now. We have to take that away from them. We take that away -- we take that away we will not even come close."
01:04:21 - 01:04:43 (22 sec),"So here's the concept, we have to protect and cannot run away from a thing called preexisting conditions. We can't do it. You're going to get clobbered. A friend of mine is running in a certain state. I'm not going to embarrass him. He's got a 20-point lead. He's running for governor. 20-point lead, it's over."
01:04:43 - 01:05:16 (33 sec),"About a month later I say, ""Hey,"" the election hadn't take place -- taken place, I said, ""How is it going out there? How's he doing?"" ""Sir, he's 20 points down."" ""Wait a minute. He was 20 points up. What are you talking about?"" ""No, sir, right now he's 20 points down. He's getting killed."" I said, ""Why?"" ""Because he wanted to terminate preexisting conditions."" Well, that was a poll."
01:05:16 - 01:05:59 (43 sec),"This is a guy, he ended up getting clobbered. He had an easy race. He was already buying the carpet for the mansion. Not our mansion, a different mansion. I guess that didn't work out too well. And I'll never forget, five governors sitting in front of me, I was making a speech, very conservative governors, and I said, because I hadn't really taken a position and, but I -- I think we have to go with the preexisting, and I'm making a speech, ""And we will support, and the Republicans cherish preexisting conditions."" And these five Southern guys down there, they're looking me, ""What the hell was that all about?"
01:05:59 - 01:06:19 (21 sec),"What?"" And I told him, I said, ""We have to support it. We should support it. We're doing the right thing. And if you don't support it, you have no chance of winning. I mean, I just want to be blunt, you have no chance of winning."" The Democrat plan will be devastating to the people with preexisting conditions."
01:06:19 - 01:07:22 (63 sec),"We have great talking points. The Republican Party will be the champion of preexisting conditions. You have to do it. Some of you like it, some of you don't, but you're going to have to like. Not only for politics, it's the right thing. We want to be the party of great health care. I am, right now, working with people, and here's the key to all of it, I'm right now working with people in this room, knowledgeable leaders in Congress and with experts in the administration, I have a couple of people, one in particular who is a total health care genius, this person knows more about healthcare and loves the subject, loves it, to come up with a great health care plan that is far less costly to the people, not to the government, to the people."
01:07:22 - 01:07:45 (23 sec),"Far less costly than Obamacare with the deductibles that are far lower. The deductibles are so high that nobody gets to use it unless you're in serious condition so serious that, frankly, the last thing on your mind is health care. I will be asking that this be my first vote immediately after the election."
01:07:45 - 01:08:06 (21 sec),"We are going to regain the House because of health care and other things, the border, the military, the police. They're for open borders and crime. We're for great borders and merit-based immigration, merit-based, so they can help our country and help our companies that are all moving into our country and need people to work."
01:08:06 - 01:08:31 (25 sec),"We're going to keep the Senate and we're going to keep the presidency and we're going to bring back the House. So essentially, what I'm saying is we're going to come up with a health care plan. We're not going to vote on it until after the election. We'll all promise it's going to be our first vote because we blew it the last time."
01:08:31 - 01:08:55 (24 sec),"Man, I was fed a bill of goods. I want to tell you, some of you, I'm still a little bit angry, but not all of you. Wasn't even your fault. But we should have done it when we had the position. But we're going to get it back and it's got to be a better plan. So we're going to give a great health care plan."
01:08:55 - 01:09:23 (28 sec),"And we're going to go and campaign on that plan with the understanding that if we win it's going to be much less expensive than Obamacare and much more usable in terms of deductibles. And what's going to happen is we're going to promise the people that if you vote for us and if they vote for you, all of you running, that we're going to vote for this."
01:09:23 - 01:09:49 (26 sec),"It's going to happen but we have to get back the House. You know what? You're going to win back the House. I think it's going to be one of the strongest things you have because people don't like Obamacare. We forgot about it. We had a very, very unfortunate vote by somebody. We were close. We were so close."
01:09:49 - 01:10:04 (15 sec),"One vote away. One vote away. But it didn't work. But this is going to be something, I think, that has even more potential. It's going to be a better plan. I already know what they're doing with it. And we're going to -- we're going to use it. We're going to campaign on that plan. And it's so much better than Obamacare."
01:10:04 - 01:10:23 (20 sec),"Now, here's your alternative, turn off whatever they talk about health care. ""I don't want to talk about it. Oh, it's a bad -- "" because, you know, I know it's a tough subject. But we have a great advantage here. And we vote right after the election. It's going to get a lot of people elected and you're going to be doing the right thing."
01:10:23 - 01:10:41 (18 sec),"Additionally, we'll be knocking the Democrats Socialistic, single payer health care plan with all of the disasters floors, including all of those great Americans that are going to lose their plan. Remember, ""You can have your doctor. You could have your plan."" I mean, so many lies, so many lies. So you're going to be campaigning against very negative things."
01:10:41 - 01:11:05 (24 sec),"You're going to win your elections because of health care. And a lot of people were upset with me because I announced this like a week ago, and I didn't want to waste my time by calling people. I didn't want to call the leaders, other than Kevin. I'd be afraid to call Kevin. But I didn't call people. They said, ""What?"
01:11:05 - 01:11:33 (28 sec),"What? I don't know anything about it."" I blame myself a little bit. But now they love it. They really like it. You're going to get elected because of it and you're going to be doing the right thing. It's a great incentive for the voters to vote for you. So instead of when they ask you a health care question and say, ""I'd -- I'd rather not answer that question."" ""But what about preexisting -- "" ""Ah, ah, Alice, take me home, Alice."
01:11:33 - 01:11:59 (27 sec),"They're asking me about preexisting -- Alice, please take me home."" And then you get clobbered. You got a plan that's a much better plan. And it's going to be your first vote when you get back to Washington. The radical Democrats are also aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth, right."
01:11:59 - 01:12:20 (21 sec),"Whoever heard of this stuff? I had it in the debate. I never use the term ripped. It was my term. And people that had been working on this on our side for years said it was an incredible moment. I didn't know about -- I didn't use that term. I never heard of that term. I thought of it during the debate, because Hillary Clinton was so staunch on abortion and rights of abortion."
01:12:20 - 01:12:41 (21 sec),"And I said, ""According to Hillary, in the ninth month you can rip -- "" that's where it came up. Does anybody remember that debate? They say that was like a big moment. You can rip the baby out of the womb and kill the baby. But now it's gotten worse. Because this maniac, the governor from Virginia, he comes up and says, ""Now the baby is born."
01:12:41 - 01:13:11 (30 sec),"And you wrap the baby gently and then you talk to the mother and dependent on what the mother says you execute the baby."" Can you imagine, whoever heard of it? I never even heard of this one. I've heard of ninth month, which is horrible. I've heard of fifth month and fourth month, but this is the baby is now born and the mother will make a decision as to whether or not that baby will be, essentially, executed."
01:13:11 - 01:13:30 (19 sec),"And he said that. He said that. And he said some other things that were unrelated to that which were bad. And believe it or not, which were covered even more so than that, which I couldn't believe that it was. His other thing, you know what that was, was covered more importantly in the media than that. And what can be more important than that?"
01:13:30 - 01:13:48 (18 sec),"That's why I've called on Congress to pass legislation banning the late-term abortion of children who can feel the pain in their mother's womb. And, you know, it's always been a very close issue. It's been for many, many years. It's been a 50/50 issue. I don't know if you saw, it was so horrible and so extreme what the Democrats in New York, you saw what was happening, they're all applauding."
01:13:48 - 01:14:11 (22 sec),"It was so horrible, so horrible, that you gained 11 points in the poll. This is the first time it's no longer -- it was a 49-51 issue for many, many -- for decades. It never really changed. It would go from 51-49 back and forth. You just picked up 11 points because of how extreme that was. It was so terrible."
01:14:11 - 01:14:27 (16 sec),"Democrats are the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, hoaxes, delusions. Whenever House Democrats are ready to abandon their extremism the Republicans here tonight are ready to work with them to deliver a much better future for all of our citizens. We're willing to work together."
01:14:27 - 01:14:54 (27 sec),"I told Nancy Pelosi the other day, I was with her, it was a nice conversation. Unfortunately, every time we have a great conversation she then goes out and does a news conference and she says I'm a terrible human being. I don't figure that but I guess that's called politics. Every day we're restoring America's strength at home and we are restoring our nation's standing all over this world."
01:14:54 - 01:15:16 (22 sec),"Two years ago ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. I was told that it would take at least two years from one month ago to get the Caliphate at 100 percent. You saw that. My generals, that I got rid of, told me it would take two years to get two percent. I went to Iraq."
01:15:16 - 01:15:57 (41 sec),"I stayed in the White House for almost four months. The only time I left was to go to Iraq. I'll tell you, if you have to get cabin fever getting cabin fever in the White House is still a good place. But I went to Iraq and I met the generals and one general said, ""Sir, we can do it in one week."" I said, ""Wait a minute, they said two years."" They said, ""That's because we're hitting them at a much different level."" And we did it and we now have 100 percent of the ISIS -- it's been completely obliterated."
01:15:57 - 01:16:18 (21 sec),"And that doesn't mean you don't have cells and these crazy people, I got to say it, because you saw it, you can never say, ""We won,"" because if you say, ""We won,"" and then somebody blows up a store, some crazy maniac. But we just beat the hell out of them. And we're trying to now beat them at the Internet because there's nobody better at the Internet than them."
01:16:18 - 01:16:42 (24 sec),"I don't know if you saw recently I put some social media that they're losers, that they're dead. That if you join them you will be killed just like they're killed. We got to beat them at their own game, folks. It's not a very nice game. And they don't surrender. When we had them, I was telling Kevin McCarthy, when we had them four or five days ago, they were cornered."
01:16:42 - 01:17:08 (26 sec),"They don't know what it is to be cornered because they always had free reign. They're not -- they don't have free reign with me. And we flew over with brand new F-18s, Super Hornets, and they're going 2,000 miles an hour over and over for two days. And I said, ""Do these people ever like wave the flag? Do they ever surrender?"" And the General Raisin Cane, his name?"
01:17:08 - 01:17:45 (37 sec),"What's your first name? You know this. ""Sir my first name is Raisin."" This guy's out of central casting, I'm telling you. There's nobody in Hollywood that could look like this guy because he's much tougher. That I can tell you. I said, ""What's your name?"" ""Raisin."" ""What's your last name?"" ""Cane."" I said, ""You mean your name is Raisin Cane?"" ""Yes, sir."" That's the guy that told me. I said, ""So, my people tell me two years."
01:17:45 - 01:18:07 (21 sec),"What do you think?"" ""One week, sir."" I said, ""General, come here. Give me a kiss."" I felt like Joe Biden. But I meant it. See, I meant it, big difference. I meant it. So we knocked them out. And we now have knocked them out. And we have -- but I always say you have some crazy people around, nevertheless."
01:18:07 - 01:18:24 (18 sec),"Together, we're also fully rebuilding the American Armed Forces -- and you're doing that, what you're doing is incredible. Because without that the other things might not matter. It's a rough time of this world. I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal -- and Iran is a different country."
01:18:24 - 01:18:56 (32 sec),"When I first came here, Iran was going to take over the Middle East and there was no stopping him. And I took out of that deal. I terminated that deal and they have gone to hell. That's a different country. They have riots. Their economy is collapsed. It was a horrible, stupid deal. We gave them $150 billion and they used it to fight us. We gave them $1.8 billion in cash, airplane loads of cash."
01:18:56 - 01:19:16 (20 sec),"And I recognized the capital of Israel and we opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem for a $1 billion under budget. $1 billion under budget. We were going to spend $1 billion to build it. I got it done for $400,000. Think of that. So I saved $1 billion. I took a building that we already owned on land that we already owned."
01:19:16 - 01:19:43 (27 sec),"Somebody said, ""What's the difference between that piece of land and the piece that we were going to spend a fortune to buy?"" I said, ""The difference is it's much better. It's a better location. It's a much bigger site."" Other than that, they were very similar. And to support Israel's security just last week, and this has been going on for 58 years, I recognized fully Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights."
01:19:43 - 01:20:08 (25 sec),"58 years, they've been talking. They've had committees, they've had meetings, they've had 32 different meetings and it's talk and they never do it. So we did it. And I'll tell you what, I don't know about the United States, I think we're doing well, but I can run for the prime minister of Israel. That's what they tell me. I think I've been 90 -- I think I'm at 98 percent in Israel."
01:20:08 - 01:20:36 (28 sec),"You'd better be careful, I'll leave here and I'll go run in Israel. The United States has also taking decisive action against the brutal Socialist dictatorship in Venezuela. That's a horrible situation. And America, once again, stands with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, in their righteous struggle for freedom and we're helping them out."
01:20:36 - 01:20:56 (20 sec),"So we're gathered here tonight at a very pivotal moment in our nation's history. That's true. This is a very important moment. You know, we have forces going against this country from within that can destroy this country. If we lose this election -- You know, when I go out to make a speech I meet people."
01:20:56 - 01:21:18 (22 sec),"I don't get to see too many people, but I meet people backstage going on. And they'd say to me, ""Thank you, sir, for saving our country."" They're talking to all of us, by the way. ""Thank you, sir."" A man came up to me a week ago. We were in Michigan. We had a tremendous crowd in Michigan. Right? Is that right?"
01:21:18 - 01:21:45 (27 sec),"That's a good group. Great crowd. And this guy looked like he never cried in his life. He looked like football player, a big strong guy and he was pouring down tears as I'm getting ready to speak. I'm walking by and he was there and he said, ""Sir, thank you for saving our country."" And I used to be surprised because I've been hearing this for a year and a half, I used to be surprised."
01:21:45 - 01:22:16 (31 sec),"You know, it's a big statement and they're oftentimes crying. And they're people that don't cry. These are not criers. These are people that are real stalwarts, not crying. Nothing wrong with crying, but they often are crying. And I've heard it so much. We have an election coming up that if something bad should happen with this election we could lose the country, we really could, because these people are stone cold crazy."
01:22:16 - 01:22:41 (25 sec),"What they want to do to our country would be overwhelming. It would be horrible. So we have no choice, we have to win. We really have to win. Now, it could be the start moving in a different direction, but I don't think so. It looks like they're only moving one way. The majority of American people support our common sense agenda."
01:22:41 - 01:23:05 (24 sec),"And Americans do not want to risk their prosperity or our prosperity. They don't want to risk their children's future. They don't want to risk their wealth. They don't want to risk their 401ks, where they're up 50, 60, 70, 80 percent. I talk about it all the time. They feel like financial geniuses. They've never been there before."
01:23:05 - 01:23:31 (26 sec),"And we're going to explain to them that your 401k will disappear. You're not going to have anything. We have a lot of great things going. So the Democrat program of radical Socialism and open borders, if we are good, and if we are smart, and if we do our job, it cannot work. It's not going to work. Because our people are doing too well."
01:23:31 - 01:23:51 (21 sec),"The choice has never been clearer, the Republican Party is the party for all Americans. We really are. We have changed this party so dramatically, folks. I -- I say all of us, not just me. I've been -- I've been important. You've been just as important. We're now the party of the American worker. Did you ever hear?"
01:23:51 - 01:24:21 (30 sec),"When I started doing this we were like the party of the rich person and we will losing and there were not enough rich people. We're now the party of the American family and we're the party of the American dream. It's true, you are. In South Carolina, when I was going against a lot of different people, there were 12 people left, and I'll never forget somebody came down and said, ""You have no idea what you've done."
01:24:21 - 01:24:41 (20 sec),"Thousands and tens of thousands of people are joining the Republican Party. This has never happened."" They've never seen it before. And this happened in New Hampshire. It happened to all over. It happens in Florida. It's happening now in Florida. I mean, I don't like to talk about leads to early, but we have an incredible lead in the state of Florida."
01:24:41 - 01:25:12 (31 sec),"We have an incredible lead in the state of Ohio. We have a great lead in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in South Carolina. I mean, we have leads. Now, you always have to be very careful because you have, on occasion, seen leads disappear, but we're not going to let that happen. Because we have the far better ideas, the far better platform, and I know many of the people in this room, we have the far better and more talented people."
01:25:12 - 01:25:48 (36 sec),"You are the people I'm talking about. And we believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe in religious liberty. The right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms."
01:25:48 - 01:26:14 (26 sec),"We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we believe in the words of our national motto, ""In God We Trust"". We're not going to lose that. We're not going to lose that. People want to play with that. They're not playing with that one."
01:26:14 - 01:26:50 (36 sec),"They want to play with that, you know that. We're not playing with that one. ""In God We Trust"". We fight on behalf of hardworking citizens who pay their taxes, follow our laws, raise their children, protect our communities, and made this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth. And we're doing better now than we've done in decades, and decades, and decades."
01:26:50 - 01:27:23 (33 sec),"This land is our home. These American patriots have always been loyal to our country and we will forever be loyal to them, forever. Every day for the next 19 months we will keep on fighting, we will keep on working, and we will keep on winning, winning, winning for the American people -- and for yourselves, and for yourselves, and your families."
01:27:23 - 01:28:11 (48 sec),"With your help, on November 3rd 2020 Republicans are going to win the House, we are going to win the Senate, and we are going to, again, win the White House. Thank you. And together with the love, prayers, and devotion of everyone in this really warm and incredible room, and millions of patriots across our land, we are going to Make America Great Again."
01:28:11 - 01:28:31 (20 sec),"We are going to make America greater than it's ever been before. And we are going to do it not just for you, not just for your friends, we are going to do it for all Americans. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you, everybody."
00:00:00 - 00:00:29 (29 sec),"We love that song, but let's get going. Right? I want to thank you all, and I want to thank, especially, Melania -- she works so hard -- and those moving words, even though it is from your wife, so she's maybe a little bit prejudiced in that way. But I will say that she is a hard worker and has a profound commitment to building a drug-free future for America's children."
00:00:29 - 00:00:59 (30 sec),"We're going to do it too. We're going to do it. Made a lot of progress. Today, I'm honored to join the thousands of leaders -- and that's what you are: leaders -- from across the country for the 2019 Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. Very important. Everyone here today is united by the same vital goal: to liberate our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction and to end the opioid crisis once and for all."
00:00:59 - 00:01:34 (35 sec),"It's happening. It's happening. That's happening. I want to recognize the founder of Operation UNITE for his unwavering community service, for his incredible commitment, and to address this critical issue: Congressman Hal Rogers. A friend of mine for a long time. And I want to thank you very much, Hal, wherever you may be. Thank you."
00:01:34 - 00:02:00 (26 sec),"Thank you, Hal. Good job. Very dedicated guy. We're also grateful to Operation UNITEâs President and CEO, Nancy Hale. Thank you, Nancy. And thanks also to an outstanding public servant, a man who works day and night. No matter when I need him, he's there. I'll call him at the strangest hours."
00:02:00 - 00:02:24 (24 sec),"He's always there working. Secretary Alex Azar. It's really great, Alex, what you're doing. Thank you. And CDC Administrator, Dr. Robert Redfield, who is helping us to eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2030. And we're there; we're going to be able to do that. People are shocked. Please, stand up, Doctor. So important."
00:02:24 - 00:02:48 (24 sec),"I said that recently in a speech: We will eradicate AIDS by 2030. We've made such incredible progress. And they didnât know what I was talking about. They couldnât believe it. They came up to me after the speech, Doctor. They said, ""Do you mean that?"" That's right -- we're going to have it eradicated by 2030. Thank you very much, Doctor."
00:02:48 - 00:03:10 (22 sec),"Very important. Also with us is the Lieutenant Governor of this great state, a friend of mine and a man who -- he's worked so hard with Brian. The combination of Jeff Duncan and Brian has been pretty much unbeatable. They're doing a fabulous job. Jeff, thank you very much. Jeff, where are you? Jeff? Jeff, thank you."
00:03:10 - 00:03:36 (27 sec),"Stand up, Jeff. Great job. Really great job. And, Mrs. Duncan, thank you very much. And the Georgia Attorney General, Chris Carr. Chris, thank you. Tough guy. And he's in there fighting for us. I know that. As well as members of Congress: Rick Allen, Drew Ferguson, Barry Loudermilk, and Jody Hice."
00:03:36 - 00:04:02 (26 sec),"We have them all. We have them all. Thatâs a pretty unbeatable group. Weâve been doing okay together, havenât we? Huh? Weâve been doing good. To all of the people in this room who serve every day on the frontiers and frontlines of this crisis -- and a crisis it is -- you have earned the gratitude of our entire nation."
00:04:02 - 00:04:33 (31 sec),"You may not even know it, but our nation loves you and they love what youâre doing. Thank you very much. You are the first responders who bring patients back to life. You are the law enforcement officers who bring drug traffickers to justice. You are the doctors, nurses, and counselors who give struggling citizens the hope and solace and strength to build a brighter and brighter future."
00:04:33 - 00:05:05 (32 sec),"And you are the families and faith communities who help thousands of Americans overcome addiction for a new life of freedom. My administration is deploying every resource at our disposal to empower you, to support you, and to fight right by your side. And thatâs what weâre doing. We will not solve this epidemic overnight, but we will stop -- thereâs just nothing going to stop us, no matter how you cut it. I know some of the people in this room."
00:05:05 - 00:05:30 (25 sec),"Nothing stops you. Nothing stops you, I can tell you. We will never stop until our job is done, and then maybe weâll have to find something new. And I hope thatâs going to be soon. But we will succeed. We have results that are unbelievable; numbers that I heard, two weeks ago, that I was shocked to hear."
00:05:30 - 00:05:56 (26 sec),"Weâre making tremendous progress. Each year, more than 70,000 precious American lives are lost to the opioid and drug crisis. And, in my opinion, the number is much higher than that. To protect all Americans, my administration declared the opioid epidemic a nationwide public health emergency. A big step."
00:05:56 - 00:06:36 (40 sec),"Since then, we have secured a record $6 billion in new funding to combat the opioid crisis, and thatâs the most ever. And weâre going for even bigger numbers this year. Last year, we provided $90 million to prevent youth substance abuse, and I signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act -- the largest-ever legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in our nationâs history."
00:06:36 - 00:07:13 (37 sec),"Itâs the largest ever. Following the recommendation of my Surgeon General and many others, last year the distribution of the overdose-reversing drug, naloxone, increased by over one million units. Pretty amazing stuff. To expand access to treatment, recovery, and other crucial activities and services, all throughout our nation we have given opioid response grants to states, totaling a record $2 billion."
00:07:13 - 00:07:35 (22 sec),"We are now allowing states to use Medicaid funds to pay for residential treatment facilities, and theyâre being built all over the country. In my first year in office, the number of patients receiving medication-assisted treatment at community health centers increased by 64 percent. No other President did that."
00:07:35 - 00:08:31 (56 sec),"No other President. We have no choice. We have no choice. We passed the CRIB Act to expand treatment for mothers and their babies who are born physically dependent on opioids. For our nationâs veterans, we are improving pain management, with over 43,000 fewer veterans on opioids since January 2017. Think of that -- 43,000. Twenty-three thousand [Forty-three thousand]. And, by the way, for the veterans, 45 years theyâve been trying to get it. As you know, just recently, I signed Veterans Choice, where a veteran can go, and if the wait is going to be days or weeks or months -- which it used to be -- they go out and see a private doctor."
00:08:31 - 00:09:02 (31 sec),"Take immediate care. We pay for it. We take care of it. And it's been an incredible -- it's new and it's been incredible, the difference it's made. And just months ago, I signed bipartisan criminal justice reform into law. Among other critical changes, the FIRST Step Act provides addiction treatment to Americans in prison."
00:09:02 - 00:09:43 (41 sec),"And I'm pleased to report that, in just four months, more than 16,000 inmates are participating in new drug treatment. And criminal justice reform -- I have to say, people are getting out of prison. And since our founding, they were having an impossible time getting a job. But because our economy is doing so well, perhaps the best it's ever been in our history -- best unemployment numbers in history, best everything."
00:09:43 - 00:10:07 (24 sec),"Because of this -- because of this, prisoners getting out are signing in; they're getting jobs. And I can tell you that those employers -- because I speak to a lot of them -- are thrilled. They had no idea. I'm so proud of that. So, the great economy has made it much easier. They get out, and then they have to prove themselves."
00:10:07 - 00:10:26 (19 sec),"They never got a chance to prove themselves. Now they prove themselves, and they are doing a spectacular job. Not all of them, but there's nothing ""all"" about any of us. But they are doing a spectacular job. So I want to thank all of you. And I want to thank -- Congressman, I want to thank you for helping me with that, because you were very instrumental."
00:10:26 - 00:10:52 (26 sec),"Thank you very much. Thank you. The Department of Labor is expanding federal efforts to help recovering Americans find a great job in our soaring economy. As a result of our historic economic boom also, we are lifting up all Americans from all walks of life, including those who have endured the pain of addiction."
00:10:52 - 00:11:09 (17 sec),"They're getting a second and third and, in some cases, a fourth chance. And they're making it. They're making it. And they really have something to live for. Some of them say, ""We love getting up in the morning. We love going to work. We love our job."" And if they don't like the job because of what's happened, it's a miracle."
00:11:09 - 00:11:35 (26 sec),"All over the world, they're talking about what's happened with our economy. If they don't like their job, they have choice also, like the vets. They have choice. It's choice of going out and finding a different job that they like better. Big impact. Last year, a record 73 percent of the new jobs went to people who were out of the workforce and are now coming back to work for the first time in many years."
00:11:35 - 00:12:03 (28 sec),"And these newly employed citizens are joining 5.5 million more workers who have found jobs since the election, driving our national unemployment rate to its lowest level in 51 years. And, as you know, and you've heard me say it, African American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country."
00:12:03 - 00:12:30 (26 sec),Asian American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country. Hispanic American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country. People that graduate without a high school diploma -- it's a big group -- lowest in the history of our country. Women -- sorry -- lowest in 61 years. [Laughter] But we'll soon have the record.
00:12:30 - 00:12:55 (25 sec),"We will soon have the record. We're going to have that record, too. We're all Americans. We are all one family. And we know that we are strongest when no one is left behind. My administration is committed to ensuring that every citizen can live with dignity and purpose and proudly pursue the American Dream."
00:12:55 - 00:13:43 (48 sec),"Critical to this effort is my administrationâs strong support for faith-based initiatives. America is a nation that believes in the power of prayer and the strength of fellowship, and we believe in the grace of God. And we're proud of it. Here with us today is Dr. Monty Burks. Nineteen years ago, Monty turned his life around when two women of prayer from his hometown church helped him to get on a path to recovery."
00:13:43 - 00:14:08 (25 sec),"Now Monty works for Tennesseeâs -- what a great state -- Department of Mental Health and is Director of their Faith-Based Recovery Initiative. Monty, please, come up and tell us a little bit about your work."
00:14:08 - 00:14:33 (25 sec),"In awe, honor, and humbled. The opposite of addiction is relationship. That simple equation is what helped me find my freedom. Criminal justice intervention led me to treatment, which led me to recover, which put me on this podium. I've been blessed to serve under Commissioner Williams -- and Commissioner Varney past before."
00:14:33 - 00:14:48 (15 sec),"They took a chance on a broken and bruised person who had been touched by the system, but they knew that I had a purpose, and my purpose was to use the pain that I'd went through to help other people not have to go through the same thing that I'd went through. You see, recovery is real. We do recover. We do recover."
00:14:48 - 00:15:17 (29 sec),"To me, the paradigm shifts with the faith community. Our governor, Bill Lee, supports the faith-based community being the catalyst to change, to control the narrative, to explain how people and recovery can come back and be fruitful and change the paradigm themselves, in their own communities."
00:15:17 - 00:15:38 (21 sec),"Employers trust the faith community. We go back to work not just for a job but for a career, so we can go back and lead as peers so those who were behind us crying in the wilderness will have a second chance to stand before a podium like this and tell you that, yes, recovery is real. We do recover."
00:15:38 - 00:16:06 (27 sec),"Secretary Azar, I want to thank you for your work with HHS and the Office of Faith-Based with Shannon Royce and Heidi. And they spread the word and the message about faith-based recovery and treatment across the state. Today, this is my pulpit, and I have to say this: Someone in a program hears me right now and says, ""I can, because you did."
00:16:06 - 00:16:20 (14 sec),"I can, because he did."" That's right. Yes, you can. Look in the mirror. There is your miracle. I want to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me this space to stand beside you. I want to thank God for you and the First Lady and your support of the recovery community. Thank you."
00:16:20 - 00:17:11 (51 sec),"Wow, that's great, Monty. And he had this beautiful speech written down in his iPhone -- this is the new way of doing it -- [Laughter] -- and he never looked at it once. [Laughter] That's a pretty good job. Thank you very much, Monty. Appreciate it. Fantastic. My administration has also embarked on an unprecedented effort to shut down online criminal networks, crack down on illegal international shipments, and stop the deadly flow of drugs into our country."
00:17:11 - 00:17:37 (26 sec),"In the past two years, Customs and Border Protection seizures of meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl at the southern border are up 45 percent and going up much higher. We are seizing it all over. You probably saw the numbers today. We are detaining, capturing -- call it anything you want -- more people than ever before."
00:17:37 - 00:18:07 (30 sec),"Some of those people are not people we want in our country. And I will say Border Patrol has been incredible. There's never been a march up that border like there is today, up throughout Mexico. Mexico is starting to detain and bring back to their country, where they came from. But a lot of it is drugs, and drugs are being gotten by us. We are stopping the drug flow as much as we can."
00:18:07 - 00:18:27 (20 sec),"Soon, we're going to have a wall that's going to be a very powerful wall. It's under construction. The media doesnât like talking about it. The media doesnât like talking about it. It's one of many things we're doing. But when that wall is finished, we intend to have almost 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year."
00:18:27 - 00:18:52 (25 sec),"We're probably ahead of schedule a little bit. That'll have a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country. And we have many other things, including the finest equipment that that you can buy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the best drug detection equipment you can have. And I always say this: Because as good as that equipment is -- and itâs genius -- the greatest equipment in the world is a dog."
00:18:52 - 00:19:13 (22 sec),"Dogs -- a certain type of German Shepherd in particular. Dogs do a better job than 400 million dollars' worth of equipment. Can you believe that? Only the dog lover would understand that, right? No, it's true. I said to the Border Patrol the other day -- they were giving me a little bit of a rundown on the equipment."
00:19:13 - 00:19:32 (18 sec),"And, you know, itâs hundreds -- weâre close to 500 million dollars' worth of equipment at the ports of entry. I said, âHow does this compare to those great dogs I saw?â They say, âSir, honestly, the dogs are better.â [Laughter] I said, âYou got to be kidding.â Itâs incredible, and they showed me, and itâs actually incredible."
00:19:32 - 00:19:57 (25 sec),"But we also have a lot of dogs, and theyâre great dogs, and we cherish them. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which enters our country through our southern border. Weâre doing everything to empower ourselves so that we can keep this poison out of our communities and away from our children."
00:19:57 - 00:20:17 (20 sec),"You're going to see some very, very big differences in the coming months. Weâre capturing people that you wouldnât believe. And if you remember, when I announced that famous run, when I came down -- Iâm sure nobody saw this. When I came down the escalator with Melania and her white dress -- I donât think anybody saw that -- [Laughter] -- but I made a very strong statement about the border and I was criticized."
00:20:17 - 00:21:04 (47 sec),"They said, âOh, itâs not that bad.â Well, let me tell you, that statement was peanuts compared to reality. Peanuts. It was small-time, compared to reality. But we are confronting reality and confronting the grave security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border. And thatâs why Iâve declared a national emergency, which is exactly what it is. And weâve secured historic funding to strengthen border security, including the equipment, including the wall, including more Border Patrol agents -- including many other things that you donât even have to know about and some you donât want to know about."
00:21:04 - 00:21:37 (33 sec),"Congress must also act to fix, however, our horrible, obsolete, weak, pathetic immigration laws. We could solve the entire problem -- I say â45 minutes,â but it could go a lot quicker than that; letâs bring it down to 15 minutes -- if the Democrats would agree to do certain basic, commonsense things with respect to our laws."
00:21:37 - 00:21:55 (18 sec),"And I do think that thereâs pressure being put on them, and I think that some of them really do want to do the right thing. Iâve spoken to some recently, and you might be surprised at whatâs going to happen. But they see whatâs going on at the border. Itâs very easy to see. And theyâre seeing the drugs and theyâre seeing the human trafficking."
00:21:55 - 00:22:16 (20 sec),"The human trafficking has -- itâs like never before in our history. And this is a world problem, and itâs happening all over the world, but for us, itâs through the southern border. Today, weâre grateful to be joined by Virginia State Police Senior Special Agent Tom Murphy, who has been chasing down drug traffickers for decades."
00:22:16 - 00:22:50 (34 sec),"In recent years, he has seen a surge of cheap heroin being trafficked from Mexico, which is now being laced with ultra-lethal fentanyl. Tragically, a year and a half ago, Special Agent Murphyâs own son died from an overdose of this kind of deadly drug. And it is deadly. Special Agent Murphy, Americaâs heart breaks for you and for all of the families that have suffered so needlessly."
00:22:50 - 00:23:10 (21 sec),"No other family should have to experience the pain and the sorrow that youâve endured. Would you please come up to say a few words? Please, Special Agent. Thank you."
00:23:10 - 00:23:35 (24 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President and First Lady, for this time and opportunity to speak. Both professionally and personally, Hal has touched my life and my familyâs life. I worked for the State Police of Virginia for 31 years, assigned to a narcotics division drug enforcement section for 23 of those 31 years. I sat in your seat four years ago, at this same conference."
00:23:35 - 00:24:08 (34 sec),"While I was here four years ago, my son Jason was battling drug addiction. His story is one thatâs all too common today. He grew up with ADD, depression, and was medicated at a young age. Prior to 18 years old, he started self-medicating with marijuana. He knew at 18 years old he had to move out of the house because Dad is Dad, and Dad is a police officer, and you canât do that at home."
00:24:08 - 00:24:34 (26 sec),"Well, on his 18th birthday -- on the day he turned 18 -- he moved out of our home. He would later tell me it's the worst decision he's ever made in his life. When he did so, about a year or two later, he had a work-related injury where he severed four fingers from his hand. He was introduced to opioids, which was my greatest fear."
00:24:34 - 00:25:12 (38 sec),"I would see him around town, and my wife -- you could his physical decline. He'd been arrested a couple of times for possession and distribution to continue his habit. Twelve days before Christmas -- December 13th, 2017, 12 days before Christmas, he passed away of a heroin and fentanyl overdose."
00:25:12 - 00:25:52 (40 sec),"People talk about stigma associated with opioids, heroin, drugs. There is a stigma, and the stigma needs to stop. If you want to think about stigma, think about a family that's been though it professionally and personally. And my family has. And that's only one family of 70,000 in 2017 who lost a loved one because of opioids and heroin."
00:25:52 - 00:26:21 (29 sec),"The stigma needs to stop. You need to share your story. I wear two bracelets every day since my son's death. On my right wrist is a purple bracelet to honor those who have fallen from drug overdose. It has his name on it and date and birth and date of death. On my left wrist, I have two: Thin Blue Line and I've got another one that simply states, ""Every overdose is someone's child. Don't judge. Educate."""
00:26:21 - 00:27:01 (39 sec),"So that's why we're here and that's why you're here. You took the first initiative, maybe, if you're here for the first time, to collaborate, to brainstorm, to strategize, to figure out this problem collectively. But the message I want to convey today is: Don't judge. There are 70,000 different stories that happened in 2017. You heard my son's. His name was Matthew Jason Murphy. Thank you."
00:27:01 - 00:28:13 (73 sec),"Thank you. You know, I think I can say with surety that your son, your boy, is looking down right now at you and he's very proud of his father. Very, very proud. Thank you. We are making great progress to stop fentanyl from coming into our communities. As a result of my negotiations with President Xi of China -- doing a very big trade deal -- they've announced that next week they will implement new measures to prevent Chinese fentanyl -- which is most of it; almost all fentanyl comes from China -- from being shipped to the United States."
00:28:13 - 00:28:42 (29 sec),"And furthermore -- and I appreciate this, from President Xi -- they've agreed that they're going to make it a major crime. It's not a crime now. It's down as an industrial drug. And they're going to make it a crime, and they're going to charge people with the highest level of crime. And, in China, unlike in our country, the highest level of crime is very, very high."
00:28:42 - 00:29:18 (36 sec),"It's the ultimate. You pay the ultimate price. So I appreciate that very much. Since I signed the STOP Act into law, our amazing Customs and Border Protection officers have stopped over six times more packages from reaching American doorsteps. It's a big deal. Right here, in Georgia, Customs and Border Protection officers at the seaport in Savannah recently discovered an estimated 19 million dollars' worth of cocaine in a shipment of Colombian pineapples."
00:29:18 - 00:29:47 (29 sec),"Today, we're proud to be joined by two officers who helped find those deadly drugs: James Long and Derrick Nobles. And thank you both for your courageous work. Where are you, folks? Where are you? Come on. Come on up here. Come up. Please."
00:29:47 - 00:30:04 (17 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you all for having us here, first of all. And again, thank you for all your support. It's been a -- it's been a long road, and we're glad to have the President behind us. I'm glad to have you all behind us on the law enforcement side and the community itself, because you all are our biggest help with finding this."
00:30:04 - 00:30:10 (6 sec),"It's like finding a needle in the haystack, on most days. But again, thank you all every day for your support. Thank you."
00:30:10 - 00:30:39 (29 sec),"Thank you. Thank you both very much. Great job. So many incredible people that I've met doing exactly what you're doing. To all of the Customs and Border Protection officers, DEA agents, and state and local law enforcement that are here today: We love you, we support you, and we are with you all the way."
00:30:39 - 00:31:07 (28 sec),"All the way. You know, we had billions of dollars of military equipment, which the previous administration, for their own reason, was not willing to give up to law enforcement. And I decided that we will. This was beautiful, great, strong, powerful equipment, safety equipment. You know exactly what I'm talking about."
00:31:07 - 00:31:26 (19 sec),"And we gave billions and billions of dollars throughout the United States to law enforcement. And it's had a tremendous impact because -- I don't know if it's for that reason. Probably not. It's probably because of the great men and women involved. But the numbers are way down. Crime -- way down. So, thank you all very much."
00:31:26 - 00:32:03 (38 sec),"Appreciate it. My administration is also taking aggressive action to reduce the over-supply of highly addictive prescription drugs. The Department of Justice has prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in cases involving opioids. And earlier this week, the United States filed criminal charges against the sixth- largest drug wholesaler for illicit distribution of opioids -- because we are holding big pharma accountable."
00:32:03 - 00:32:30 (26 sec),They should be accountable. And they didn't give to my campaign. I don't want their money. [Laughter] They gave to a lot of other campaigns; that's the problem. But we are holding them -- I couldn't care less. They've got to do what's right. Doing a lot of things. We're also working very strong on drug pricing.
00:32:30 - 00:33:07 (37 sec),"It's coming way down. For the first time -- for the first time in 54 years, drug prices went down this year. They went down a little below even. That's a big thing. First time in 54 years. And I give great credit to you, Alex, for that. You and your whole group of wonderful people. Alex was a very, very successful executive at one of the biggest of the companies, and he understood the system better than anybody."
00:33:07 - 00:33:31 (24 sec),And we're lucky to have him. He has done an incredible job. Thank you very much. Many drug companies are giving European countries a better deal than they give their own country. And that has to stop. We've already informed them that's stopping. We are making sure that our great seniors on Medicare will share in the discounts given to other countries.
00:33:31 - 00:34:02 (31 sec),"And you know what that means. The sophisticates out there that do this for a living, you know exactly -- that's a big deal. Sounds like big deal, but it really is a big deal. At long last, we're stopping the drug companies and foreign countries from rigging the system -- I know all about the rigging the system because I had the system rigged on me. [Laughter and applause] I think you know what I'm talking about."
00:34:02 - 00:34:25 (23 sec),"Unfortunately, that will be your sound bite tonight, but that's okay. [Laughter] System was rigged. But rigging the system against our great seniors. And to help doctors and scientists develop non-addictive painkillers, we have nearly doubled funding for opioid and pain research. Thank you very much, Doctor."
00:34:25 - 00:34:58 (33 sec),"Come on. Stand. He gives away more money than any human being on Earth. Thank you. Great. Such an important -- if we can find that answer, that's going to be a big -- that's going to solve most of the problem, I suspect. How close are we? [Laughter] He's saying, ""Okay."" [Laughter] You'll get it. You'll get it. One year ago, we pledged to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third."
00:34:58 - 00:35:31 (33 sec),"Already during my time in office, we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent. That's a pretty amazing number. Pretty amazing. And I'm glad to report today that drug overdose deaths are down in the various states that we polled and checked -- the ones hardest hit by the opioid crisis: New Hampshire, West Virginia, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Ohio."
00:35:31 - 00:35:56 (25 sec),"And they're very steeply down in three of those cases. An amazing achievement. When I campaigned in those states, that was the biggest thing. And nobody would think it. Unless you're really involved, nobody would think it. Over the last two years, our National Prescription Drug Take Back Days have collected nearly 3.7 million pounds of prescription drugs."
00:35:56 - 00:36:31 (34 sec),"Thatâs seven times the weight of Air Force One -- a very nice plane that's parked about 10 minutes away. [Laughter] A very, very big, big, heavy plane. Think of that: seven times. And the next drug take back day is this Saturday. It's great. And finally, we know one of the most important steps to ending the opioid crisis is to prevent young people from ever using drugs in the first place."
00:36:31 - 00:37:07 (36 sec),"Our massive public awareness campaign about the horrific suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58 percent of young Americans. Where's Kellyanne? Kellyanne, stand up. Kellyanne Conway. She's done a great job. I keep saying, ""Kellyanne, where are those ads?"" Because, you know, if you do it properly -- and we've had some great ones, great ads -- young people looking at these ads, they won't start."
00:37:07 - 00:37:51 (44 sec),"I think, in many ways, you don't see the result for four or five years, but in many ways, that's one of the most important things we can be doing. So we're doing that and we're spending a lot of money on that. I think it's very important. When they look out, and somebody comes to them and wants to sell them drugs and they start thinking about what they just saw on television, or wherever they may have seen it, it's going to be a little harder for them to make that sale, and that's okay with me. It's the way we want it. And I'm very encouraged that in my first year in office, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 100,000 fewer teens started abusing prescription painkillers."
00:37:51 - 00:38:15 (25 sec),"One hundred thousand. Here with us today is Alex Elswick and his mom -- wonderful mom -- Shelley. As a young adult, Alex overcame addiction and is now -- with his mom, they founded an organization to help families in crisis. Alex and Shelley, would you come up and share your story? Thank you. Please."
00:38:15 - 00:38:24 (9 sec),"Well, good afternoon."
00:38:24 - 00:38:26 (2 sec),Go Cats!
00:38:26 - 00:38:57 (31 sec),"[Laughs] Go Cats. My name is Alex Elswick, and I'm a person in long-term recovery. And many of you already knew that, but perhaps what you didn't know is that this is my mom. And we're a family in long-term recovery. And I could tell you all about how my addiction was ""Groundhog Day"" in hell -- lived over and over and over again."
00:38:57 - 00:39:26 (29 sec),"But we've heard enough of death and destruction for a few years now. I'd rather tell you how grateful I am to be here and how grateful I am that I get to work every day alongside my mom and my friend, Amanda Fallin-Bennett, doing the work with Voices of Hope to help people in recovery stay in recovery. And I'd like to use this time to say a big ""thank you"" to every single individual in this room who works tirelessly every day to improve the lives of people like me. Because Monty said it best: We do recover and we recover together. So thank you all for being voices of hope."
00:39:26 - 00:40:20 (53 sec),"And thank you both. As Alex and Shelley remind us, our greatest resource in the fight against drugs is the heart and the might and the soul of the American people. We will prevail because of the courage, commitment, and compassion of heroes like all of you in this room today. You're incredible people. You are Americaâs true source of strength."
00:40:20 - 00:40:49 (30 sec),"So let us resolve that, together, we will support, cherish and care for our fellow citizens through every step and every challenge on their road to recovery. We will reach out to anyone who is hurting or lost or struggling, because every American deserves to know the glory of hope, the joy of belonging, and the blessings of healing."
00:40:49 - 00:41:22 (33 sec),"We will stand proudly behind our devoted doctors and nurses and medical professionals who work so hard, and they do so much. We will honor and celebrate the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you. We love our law enforcement. I don't know if you know it, but over the last two and half years, law enforcement has become hot."
00:41:22 - 00:41:48 (26 sec),"They were having a little problem, right? But they're hot. People are loving their law enforcement more than ever before because we respect you at the highest level. We respect you. And the job you do is incredible -- and dangerous -- but it's incredible. We will strive to give every child a loving home, and every home a thriving future."
00:41:48 - 00:42:18 (30 sec),"We will renew the bonds of family and faith that link us together as citizens, as patriots, and as Americans. We will not let up. We will not give in. And we will never, ever give up on saving American lives. We will end this terrible menace. We will smash the grip of addiction. We will make our cities safe, our communities strong, and our future brighter than ever before."
00:42:18 - 00:42:40 (22 sec),"As one united nation, we will work, we will pray, and we will fight for the day when every family across our land can live in a drug-free America. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:53 (54 sec),"Thank you very much, El Paso. Thank you very much. Thank you. I am very, very thrilled to be here in the great State of Texas -- right on the banks of the legendary Rio Grande, where by the -- well, I don't know, you heard, right? Today we started a big, beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande. Right smack on the Rio Grande."
00:00:53 - 00:01:53 (60 sec),"I love this state and I love the people of this state. We've had a great romance together. You know, that. It's been a great romance and we're only getting stronger together. That's what's happening. Wow, look at all the press back. You believe that? [Audience Boos] This is like the Academy Awards used to be, used to be. They've gone down a long way since they started hitting us a little bit, right?"
00:01:53 - 00:02:38 (45 sec),"They've gone down. That was a long -- that was a long fall, but there they are. Last week I was honored to stand in the House Chamber to deliver the State of the Union -- and I asked both parties to come together to choose greatness for America. Since taking office two years ago our economy is now the hottest economy anywhere on Earth."
00:02:38 - 00:03:16 (39 sec),"Our military, which desperately needed funding, we went $700 billion and $716 billion, is More powerful than ever before. That was not a good situation. It was tired and depleted. Our great warriors were not taken care of. Now they're taken care of again the way they should be. And America is winning again."
00:03:16 - 00:04:11 (54 sec),"Isn't that nice? We're fighting for all Americans, from all backgrounds of every age, race, religion, birthplace, color, creed. We're fighting for ourselves. We're fighting for all Americans. And what is it, America first? Remember, it's America first. [Audience chants USA] Our agenda is not a partisan agenda, although some people say it is. [Audience member calls out We love you] Every once in a while it does become that way."
00:04:11 - 00:04:53 (42 sec),"Right? It's a mainstream, common sense agenda of the American people. It's where we want to be and where we want to go. And despite the fact that the media refuses to acknowledge what we've done and how well we're doing it -- [Audience Boos] -- a new poll just came out as I was coming on and it shows -- I don't know how you can do this, I don't think I've had a good story in years. [Audience laughs]"
00:04:53 - 00:05:17 (24 sec),"I don't get good -- I used to get great press until I decided to run for office. And we have done together, an incredible job. And a new poll just came out today Rasmussen, one of the most respected polls, one of the polls that got the election right, so I have to remember that, you know what the number is, 52 percent, with no good news."
00:05:17 - 00:05:50 (33 sec),"Explain that. Explain that. Explain that. How do you get that when you don't get good press? I guess 93 percent of the stories are negative. No matter what we do, they figure out a way to make it bad. [Audience Boos] Like, I'll give you a quick example. When I came in, North Korea was -- it looks like it was going to war."
00:05:50 - 00:06:22 (31 sec),"You know that. It was going to happen, bad things. Now you have no missile launches. You have no rocket testing. You have no nuclear testing. I have a good relationship, maybe even a great relationship. We have tremendous sanctions on North Korea. But we have our hostages back. We have -- remains are coming back."
00:06:22 - 00:06:47 (25 sec),"Remains. And our presidents have been dealing with North Korea for many, many decades, many, many decades. And on a nuclear way over the last 20, 30 years and all I hear is, ""Can't you move faster?"" You know what? I left Singapore 15 months ago, they've been negotiating for 85 years or something. So now their complaint is, ""What's taking him so long?"" I heard one of our great geniuses from a previous administration telling me how to negotiate with North Korea when they got taken advantage of like nobody I've ever seen before. [Audience Boos]"
00:06:47 - 00:06:56 (9 sec),"So some day, with all of us, this is all of us -- and those hats are beautiful, by the way -- Someday -- True. Someday they're going to appreciate us all. And I'm going to Vietnam, to Hanoi, in the near future, 27th and 28th of February, to have another summit and hope we -- hopefully we do as well with the second summit as we did with the first."
00:06:56 - 00:07:07 (10 sec),"I hope so. Now, we're delighted and I'm delighted to be joined this evening by the Texas leaders. You have great leaders, great people, great help to me -- that are at the forefront of this incredible American Revolution. You know, there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. We have to understand."
00:07:07 - 00:07:28 (22 sec),"There's never been. If you would say, as an example, that tonight, 69,000 people signed up to be here. Now, the arena holes 8,000, and thank you fire department, they got in about 10, thank you fire department, appreciate it. But if you want to really see something go outside, tens of thousands of people are watching screens outside."
00:07:28 - 00:07:48 (19 sec),"Tens of thousands. And we were all challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz. [Audience Boos] And then they said, ""You know what? Hey, you're supposed to win in order to run. By the way, we, I, we, I'm one and one, I'm one for one. Think of it. We had one election, we won, now we're going to be 2 for 0 and everything's going to be perfect."
00:07:48 - 00:08:05 (18 sec),"But a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name, he has -- he challenged us. So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too good. In fact, what I do, what I would do is I would say, ""that may be the end of his presidential bid,"" but he did challenge us. So I want to introduce some great people."
00:08:05 - 00:08:35 (29 sec),"Your Governor, Greg Abbott. Greg. Where is he? Where's Greg? Thank you Greg. And a great governor and a great friend of mine. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Thanks Dan. Thank you Dan. Look at him in the corner, so shy. Thank you Dan. Great job, Dan. Attorney General Ken Paxton. Thanks, Ken. And Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller."
00:08:35 - 00:09:05 (30 sec),"Thank you, Sid. Thank you, everybody. Thanks, Ken. Great job you do. And we're especially grateful to your wonderful Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Great Senators. [Audience Chants USA] And we have a lot of your Congress men and women. We have a lot of them. Are you already? And they're terrific. And they've been with us all the way."
00:09:05 - 00:09:35 (30 sec),"Pete Olson. Pete. Thanks, Pete. Thank you, Pete. Michael Burgess. Thanks Michael. John Carter. Brian Babin. And Randy Weber. Thank you very much. We are in the midst of an economic miracle. That's what's happened. You look all over the world and you study and you see what's going on. You can look at China."
00:09:35 - 00:10:22 (47 sec),"We have a team right now in China, they want to make a deal very badly. Those tariffs are costing them a lot of money and they're going into our Treasury, remember that, we're filling up with billions of dollars. And did you see the, you know, I haven't been here very long, the trade deficit really went down very big this last month, and people are saying, ""Whoa."" I told you so. That's what I do. That's what I do. And we don't want China to have a hard time."
00:10:22 - 00:10:49 (27 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. I -- I can only tell you this, we're going to make great deals on trade. We're going to make great deals on military. When we defend another nation that's rich they have to help us out. Do we agree? They have to help us out. And they're doing it. They're doing it. You saw South Korea, they were paying us $500 million a year."
00:10:49 - 00:12:15 (86 sec),"I say you got to do more. You got to give more. Anyway. Now they're up to almost $900 million, that was like a do phone calls. I said -- I said, ""Why didn't they do this before?"" They said, ""Nobody ever asked. Nobody asked."" You pick up almost $500 million a year, nobody asked. We're defending rich countries, they've got to help us out, folks."
00:12:15 - 00:12:31 (16 sec),"They've got help us out, sorry. And you know what? They're going like us more and maybe more importantly, they going to respect us. Since the election, we have created 5.3 million new jobs, including more than a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing was dead? They said manufacturing was dead, the previous administration."
00:12:31 - 00:12:51 (20 sec),"You'll never have it. You need the magic wand. That's what they said. We obviously, we found the magic wand. And by the way, those numbers is small compared to what's happening, compared to all of the companies that are moving in. The unemployment -- [Audience Boos, chants USA] Thank you very much. Thank you."
00:12:51 - 00:13:18 (27 sec),"The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have reached the lowest level in the history of our country. [Audience chants Trump] Okay, thank you. Thank you. Are you all right? Everything okay? Please. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And women have filled almost 60 percent of the new jobs created last year, which were a record number."
00:13:18 - 00:13:41 (23 sec),"We passed massive tax cuts for working families and we canceled a record number of job killing regulations. That's why your oil and gas is coming back. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate. And to give critically ill patients access to life saving treatments, we did something that they haven't been able to do for a long time, we passed Right To Try."
00:13:41 - 00:14:07 (26 sec),"Right To Try. That's an incredible thing, Right To Try. You know, we have the greatest doctors and research in the world, and if somebody was terminally ill they traveled to Asia, they traveled to Europe, they'd travel all over the world, if they had the money. If they didn't have the money, they'd just go home, there was nothing they could do. And I said, ""Wait a minute."
00:14:07 - 00:14:30 (22 sec),"We have drugs in the pipeline that are showing tremendous progress. If somebody is terminally ill let's let them have access to our drugs. Let's let them have access."" And it's much tougher than you would think. But we got it and people, you will not understand, nobody understands, the lifesaving effects, it's incredible what's going on. They are getting better."
00:14:30 - 00:15:35 (65 sec),"People are getting better that were thinking they were going to die. It's right to try, I love it. I always wondered why we didn't do it before? Now, the people in Texas won't care much about this, but the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on Earth. I didn't think you'd care about that."
00:15:35 - 00:15:57 (22 sec),"I didn't think Texas would care about that. And listen to this, and Texas oil production is now at the highest level it's ever been. And only for the great oil professionals in the room, we're getting those pipelines approved so fast you'll be able to practically double up on oil production, oil and gas."
00:15:57 - 00:17:06 (69 sec),"They're getting approved at record levels and record time, that means more money, more security, and more independence for our country -- it's very simple. Another one they said could never get passed, they've been trying to do it for 40 years, we passed VA Choice, Veterans Choice. So that now, rather than waiting online for five days, for nine days, for three weeks -- [Audience Boos, Chants USA] Where do these people come from?"
00:17:06 - 00:17:34 (28 sec),"Where do they come from? They go back home to Mommy. They get punished when they get home. [Audience chants Build that wall] Now, you really mean finish that Wall, because we've built a lot it, steady and slowly. But before we get to the Wall, so VA Accountability and VA Choice. Accountability, we couldn't fire anybody from the Veterans Administration."
00:17:34 - 00:17:56 (22 sec),"We couldn't fire anybody. They could treat our veterans badly. We had to take it. Now, you get rid of them. And VA Choice, they'd wait online for days and weeks, they couldn't see a doctor. Now, they go out, they have a choice. They get a private doctor. They have things taken care of and we pay their bill."
00:17:56 - 00:18:29 (33 sec),"They've been trying to get those two things fixed for many, many decades, many years and we got it fixed. We also passed the Farm bill for wonderful farmers, ranchers, and growers. Just got it. We just got it passed and that was it easy but we got it passed. We had to do it. Our farmers are great. So we just get that done, farmers, ranchers, growers."
00:18:29 - 00:18:50 (21 sec),"And we passed historic legislation to combat the Opioid Crisis. [Audience chants Trump] Thank you. [Audience Boos, Audience chants hey, hey, hey, goodbye, as an audience member is removed from the coliseum] Thank you. Is there any place that's more fun to be that a Trump rally, is there any place? You know, they all said, ""Mr. President, we loved the tone of your State of the Union speech."" Some people said it was a great speech."
00:18:50 - 00:19:29 (39 sec),"Some people said, ""Really a great speech."" I said, ""But if I ever did that in El Paso, Texas, it wouldn't work here too well,"" do you agree? Nice and calm. No, that's not what you're looking for. This is more fun. This is more fun. And we just signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. Nobody thought that was going to be happening."
00:19:29 - 00:19:48 (19 sec),"In my address last week, I asked lawmakers in both parties to cross the aisle and join together for the common good for all Americans. Democrats have to stop being so angry. They're angry. And they've got to start being partners to keep this -- really, look, is just an incredible miracle that's going on? We want to keep it going."
00:19:48 - 00:20:10 (22 sec),"Keep it going, and it will keep going. It will keep going. There's so much to celebrate in our country, the economy, the military, so many things we've done scientifically. The world is trying to copy what we've done, they're not going to be able to do it. Not anymore. They were catching up fast, now they're going in the wrong direction."
00:20:10 - 00:22:05 (115 sec),"Wrong direction. Unfortunately, many of the Democrats in Congress responded to my call for bipartisan cooperation by instead choosing really -- hey, look, did you ever see anything -- radical resistance, it's the radical left. But maybe it'll change. [Audience Boos] Maybe it'll change. It all has to do with 2020 and the election."
00:22:05 - 00:22:19 (15 sec),"But I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of ""Let's hop a train to California."" [Audience Boos] Of you're not allowed to own cows anymore. You know, a lot of problems. A lot of problems. But nobody's ever had this. And by the way with us, we handle it. No president should ever have to go through what we've gone through in the first two years."
00:22:19 - 00:22:35 (15 sec),"It's a hoax. It's a disgrace, and it should never be allowed to happen again. A hoax. Just recently, as an example, Senator Richard Burr, from the great State of North Carolina. He's chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and they've been investigating this Russia hoax for two years. [Audience Boos] Think of it. They've interviewed over 200 people."
00:22:35 - 00:22:55 (20 sec),"They've studied hundreds of thousands of documents and pages and Richard just announced that they found no collusion between Donald Trump and Russia collusion. The fact is, that the real collusion was between Hillary and the Democrats and the other side with Russia, that's where the collusion is. That's where the collusion is. [Audience chants Lock her up] That's starting to make a lot more sense."
00:22:55 - 00:24:44 (109 sec),"But that's where the collusion is, with the Democrats, and with Russia, and with others. And by the way, there's also collusion between the Democrats and the fake news right here. [Audience Boos] And they know it better than anybody. Too many Democrats are focused on tearing down their opposition instead of building up our country."
00:24:44 - 00:25:27 (43 sec),"They're trying to impose some of the most extreme measures and policies ever put forward by our Congress. And by the way, I don't think anybody in this room wants to pay 70, 80, 90 and 95 percent tax. Does anybody want to pay a 90 percent tax? [Audience Boos] You know, you look at what we've done with jobs, what we've done with the economy, how low your taxes are, the lowest they've been almost from the beginning, who the hell wants to change what we're doing now?"
00:25:27 - 00:25:52 (25 sec),"We are a hot, hot country. Last week they introduced a massive government takeover that would destroy our incredible economic gains. They introduced the so-called Green New Deal. [Audience Boos] It sounds like a high school term paper that got a low mark. [Audience laughs] It would shut down American energy, which I don't think the people in Texas are going to be happy with that. [Audience Boos]"
00:25:52 - 00:26:14 (22 sec),"It would shut down a little thing called air travel. [Audience Boos] How do you take a train to Europe? [Audience laughs] You know, this -- this crazy senator from Hawaii, they said, ""Do you like it?"" ""Yes, I like it very much."" Oh, really, how are we getting to Hawaii on a train? [Audience laughs] She didn't think about that one but she's thinking about it. She'll figure it out."
00:26:14 - 00:26:42 (27 sec),"They want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home, and put millions of Americans out of work, spend $100 trillion, which by the way, there's no such thing as $100 trillion, you have to spend $100 trillion -- And remember this, no other country except us is going to do it. That's a little problem, too."
00:26:42 - 00:27:17 (35 sec),"While the world's real polluters, like China, would get many of our companies and factories, they'd just move into China, move into other parts of the world. That's the way the system works. It's not going to happen folks. Don't worry, it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. $100 trillion. Let's spend $100 trillion."
00:27:17 - 00:27:46 (29 sec),"Let's rip down every building in New York City and rebuild it environmentally slightly better. To pave the way for socialism, Democrats are calling for massive tax hikes and the complete elimination of private health care. Many of us have private health care. That means you can stand on line for five days as you wait for a doctor that is not nearly as talented as your doctor."
00:27:46 - 00:28:10 (24 sec),"Remember? ""You can keep your doctor."" Remember that? 28 times, ""You can keep it."" That didn't happen. It turned out to be alive. Hey, where are the fact checkers? You know, some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact checkers. 28 times, ""You can keep your doctor."" That didn't turn out to be what he said."
00:28:10 - 00:29:31 (81 sec),"They're coming for your money and they're coming for your freedom and it'll never happen and it won't even come close, folks. Democrats are also pushing extreme late-term abortion. [Audience Boos] Allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. What's that all about?"
00:29:31 - 00:29:48 (18 sec),"So in Virginia, the governor, he's got a little publicity lately. [Audience laughs] I like it. It keeps us out of the papers. I like it. I'd like to find a few more guys like this one. He almost moon walked. His wife stopped him, ""Darling, that would be inappropriate."" I want to see somebody trying to imitate Michael Jackson in the moonwalk."
00:29:48 - 00:30:18 (30 sec),"This would not have been a good scene. His wife saved him, darling, this would be inappropriate."" I think she was right. But the governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable. And then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby."
00:30:18 - 00:30:53 (34 sec),"Execute the baby. [Audience Boos] Incredible. Millions of innocent, beautiful babies are counting on us to protect them and we will. That is why last week I go I called on Congress, with your great congressman over there -- thank you, fellas -- to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion."
00:30:53 - 00:31:13 (20 sec),"And that certainly is extreme. Many people never even heard of it. I mean, have you ever even hear of anything like this? [Audience calls out No] Democrats must also address the double standard on full display in Virginia. By the way, that state's going to go Republican pretty soon, I'm pretty sure -- because the Democrat Party has never been more outside of the mainstream."
00:31:13 - 00:31:36 (23 sec),"They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders, and crime. [Audience Boos] This weekend, some Democrats even proposed a measure that would force the release of thousands of criminal illegal aliens -- [Audience Boos] -- including dangerous felons convicted of rape, sex trafficking, violent assault, and even murder, into our country."
00:31:36 - 00:32:06 (31 sec),"Can you believe this? [Audience Boos] Their proposal would put a hard cap on the number of illegal aliens that are brave ICE officers, we love our ICE officers -- can detain and thus remove, forcing thousands of criminals to be set free into United States communities. I don't think so. Okay. I don't think so. And I want to thank our ICE offices."
00:32:06 - 00:32:51 (45 sec),"What they put up is incredible and that includes Border Patrol and that includes law enforcement. Let's face it. Law enforcement, we love them. They keep us safe. In the last two years alone, ICE officers have made 200, listen to these numbers, 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 40,000, 40,000 larcenies 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 12,000 vehicle thefts, 11,000 robberies, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 murders. [Audience Boos]"
00:32:51 - 00:33:10 (19 sec),"-- murders, murders, killings, murders. [Audience chants Build that wall] We will. We will. If we cut detention space, we are cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country. Slashing ICE tension is the first step of many for the far left, I call them the radical left We will never abolish ICE."
00:33:10 - 00:33:44 (34 sec),"They want to abolish ICE. We're never going to abolish ICE. So let me say very clearly to those pushing this ridiculous and radical agenda, I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country. And I will never abolish or in any way mistreat our great heroes from ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement, never."
00:33:44 - 00:34:12 (28 sec),"We will always stand with those brave men and women. We will always be with them. We're going to take care of them just like they take care of us, remember that. Now, I have to tell you, as I was walking up to the stage they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we're building the Wall anyway."
00:34:12 - 00:35:10 (58 sec),"They say that progress has been made, interesting. Just now. Just now. I said, ""Wait a minute. I got to take care of my people from Texas. I got to go. I don't even want to hear about it."" I don't want to hear it. So I don't know what they mean ""progress is being made significant"". Now, what did happen is the Democrats were being hit really hard on the concept of releasing criminals into our society, that has not been playing well."
00:35:10 - 00:35:35 (25 sec),"So maybe progress is being made, maybe not. But I had a choice, I could have stayed out there and listened or I could have come out to the people of El Paso in Texas. I chose you. I chose you. So -- so we probably have some good news. But who knows? Who knows? We'll -- we're -- we're setting the stage folks."
00:35:35 - 00:36:22 (47 sec),"You know what it's called, right? It's called with setting the stage. We're setting the table. We're doing whatever we have to do the walls being built, it'll continue. It's going at a rapid pace. The Rio Grande, it's happening, go check it out. We proudly welcome those who come lawfully, and support our values in the United States, and that want to strengthen our society and help us with all of the companies moving into the United States, moving back, they left us now they're moving back, many of them, in some cases, maybe all of them, but they all want to come back because the United States is where the action is, very simple. [Audience chants USA]"
00:36:22 - 00:37:00 (38 sec),"It's where the action is. And it is -- we're most proud of the fact, you look at the car companies, they're moving back. They're going into Michigan. They're going into Pennsylvania. They're going back to Ohio. So many companies are coming back. And by the way, that's why I want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit."
00:37:00 - 00:37:29 (29 sec),"Through merit, so they can help us build our country. Make America Great Again, pretty soon we're going to be saying, Keep America Great, Keep America Great. Pretty soon. Pretty soon, congressman, Keep America Great. We'll have to switch over. Tell me, tell me, the campaign's sort of started because you have these people that nobody ever heard of, they're all running for office."
00:37:29 - 00:38:19 (50 sec),"I said, ""Who is that?"" ""Well, that person was a mayor of a city that was defeated."" Well, how about Beto, Beto was defeated to, right? [Audience Boos] But he suffered a great defeat. Watch what the news does tomorrow, though, they won't mention the disparity. They won't mention the disparity tomorrow. They'll say, ""Beto O'Rourke,"" That's his last name, right, O'Rourke?"
00:38:19 - 00:38:58 (38 sec),"Beta O'Rourke had a wonderful rally of about 15 people. [Audience laughs] No, when they get honest, when the media starts becoming honest, and maybe they will, because we've done something that's never been done before, we have suffered a totally dishonest media and we've won and it's driving them crazy."
00:38:58 - 00:39:36 (38 sec),"It's driving them crazy. It's driving them crazy but look at them, they still come. I've never said anything like it. But illegal immigration hurts all Americans, including millions of legal immigrants, by driving down wages, draining public resources, and claiming countless innocent lives. You see what's going on, folks."
00:39:36 - 00:40:37 (61 sec),"You know what's going on. They give you all of these phony stats they say, ""Oh, it's the same. It's the same."" It's not the same. It's a bad situation going on and we've stopped it. We are taking out thousands and thousands of people from MS-13, we're bringing them to hell out of our country, thousands. But if we had proper border security, including a very powerful wall, we wouldn't have to work so hard and it would be a lot safer and a lot better."
00:40:37 - 00:41:13 (36 sec),"My Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration, while modernizing our legal immigration system, which has been in terrible shape for many, many decades to prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves for them actually and contribute to our economy, people that come in on merit, merit, merit -- instead of random lotteries and chain migration."
00:41:13 - 00:41:39 (26 sec),"Chain migration, that's another beauty. [Audience Boos] We want a merit based system for entry, this will improve living conditions for all Americans living here today, both immigrant and U.S. born, everybody's going to be happy. And we need the people to take care of these companies that are moving. Our unemployment rate, real unemployment, 3.6, 3.7 -- and going down, had a little blip because of a thing called the shutdown."
00:41:39 - 00:42:47 (68 sec),"But remember, it went up to 4.0. I said, ""Boy, that's -- "" Do you know how low 4.0 is? Do you know anybody else, any other president that would have said, ""Please give me 4.0, please?"" [Audience laughs] We had a little blip, it went up from 3.7 to 4.0, just quickly. But you know what? If we didn't do that shutdown we would not have been able to show this country these politicians, the world, what the hell is happening with the border."
00:42:47 - 00:43:19 (33 sec),"That was a very important thing we did. And the fact is, illegal immigration is a heartbreaking human tragedy. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the very long and dangerous journey north up to our country. Sex traffickers, these are the worst human beings on Earth, exploit our porous border to sell young girls and women into modern day slavery."
00:43:19 - 00:44:21 (62 sec),"You wouldn't even know that, nobody knows that. And by the way, do you think they come in through the ports of entry? [Audience calls out No] I listen to the Democrats, let me nice, just say the Democrats, I won't be specific, and they say, ""Oh, everything comes through the port."" They don't do that. They drive out where there's no barrier, no wall, they make a left."
00:44:21 - 00:44:56 (34 sec),"Congratulations, you're in the United States. That's all. If you have three women tied up in the backseat of a car, you're not going through, folks, a port of entry where they do look in the backseat, at least, right? Drugs pouring through the border kills tens of thousands of innocent Americans a year, including heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, and so many others."
00:44:56 - 00:45:31 (35 sec),"They come through the Southern border. We have a drug problem over the last 6, 7, 10 years like we have never had before. We can have such a big cut in the numbers, in the percentages, if we get the Wall built -- if we have a strong Wall with other things, but we need the Wall and it has to be built and we want to build it fast."
00:45:31 - 00:46:02 (30 sec),"The number of illegal immigrants crossing our borders is so large that we've know where to hold them. We have to build -- they want buildings, they want jails. They want, these people, how about the word caravan? [Audience Boos] Caravan, I think that was one of mine, but it looked like a caravan. Where you have thousands and thousands of people coming from Guatemala, from Honduras, and El Salvador, and they march up through Mexico."
00:46:02 - 00:46:26 (24 sec),"And by the way, if we didn't have walls in those areas, in some cases that we put up, in many cases where we reinforced, in many cases where our great military helped us with barbed wire -- you would have people pouring in. They don't pour in. The problem is our laws are so bad that there's no way we can quickly remove them."
00:46:26 - 00:46:59 (33 sec),"Other countries say, ""Get out of here."" We have to bring them through a court system. We sign their names, they touch our land, we sign them up, we explained to them, ""Please come back in six years for court,"" and only the dumbest people show back up. Nobody ever shows up. Nobody comes back in, like 2 percent."
00:46:59 - 00:47:33 (34 sec),"They go in to our country. The good news is we have great law enforcement and many of these people, we know where they are, and we're going to get them the hell out. But we have to change our laws. So right now we have a backlog. You won't even believe this. Other countries don't do this. Somebody walks into our country, we bring them to court, we have now a legal -- we need Perry Mason -- [Audience laughs] -- we have a legal case."
00:47:33 - 00:48:07 (34 sec),"Nobody else does that. Other countries say, ""Get out. You can't come in. You're not a citizen of whatever country."" We bring them in. So listen to this, right now we have almost 900,000 cases, 900,000. How many judges are going to take care of -- we're going to have to hire tens of thousands of judges to do that, 900,000 cases."
00:48:07 - 00:48:58 (50 sec),"How stupid is this? This was a system put in place by really dumb people or people that did not have the best interests of our country at heart. And there's no place better to talk about border security, whether they like it or not, because I've been hearing a lot of things,"" Oh, the Wall didn't make that much of a difference."" You know where it made a big difference?"
00:48:58 - 00:49:34 (36 sec),"Right here in El Paso. And I've been watching where they've been trying to say, ""Oh, the Wall didn't make that much -- "" Well you take a look at what they did with their past crimes and how they made them from very serious to a much lesser, you take a look at what the real system is. I spoke to people that have been here a long time they said, ""When that wall went up, it's a whole different ball game."" Is that a correct statement?"
00:49:34 - 00:50:22 (48 sec),"A whole different ball game. I'll give you another example. And I don't care whether a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat, they're full of crap when they say it has it made a big difference. I heard the same thing from the fake news. They said, ""Oh, crime actually stayed the same."" It didn't say the same, it went way down and look at what they did to their past crimes and look at how they recorded those past crimes, it went way, way down."
00:50:22 - 00:50:42 (20 sec),"These people, you know, you'd think did want to get to the bottom of a problem and solve a problem, not try and pull the wool over everybody's eyes. So for those few people that are out there on television saying, ""Oh, it didn't make too much of a difference,"" it made a -- people from El Paso, am I right?"
00:50:42 - 00:51:31 (48 sec),"It's fake news. It's fake. I'm telling you, just fake news. And you know what? You wouldn't even have to know you can say that automatically without even knowing it. It's obvious, it's common sense. Just a few thousand feet, as an example, from where we stand right now on the other side of the border, it's one of the most dangerous cities in the world, Juarez, Mexico."
00:51:31 - 00:52:17 (46 sec),"Well, the people at Juarez agree. Yet, thanks to a powerful border wall and El Paso, Texas it's one of America's safest cities now. Now, listen to the this, so you're talking a few feet away, right, a few feet, got a wall, a few feet away. Last year Juarez had 1,200 murders, El Paso, right next door, a few feet away, had 23 murders."
00:52:17 - 00:52:51 (34 sec),"That's not good either. But 23 compared to 1,200. Walls work, actually there's nothing like them for what we're talking about. We want to stop drugs. We want to stop traffickers. We want to stop criminals from coming in, walls save lives. Walls save tremendous numbers of lives. The biggest proponents of open borders are rich liberals and wealthy donors."
00:52:51 - 00:53:14 (23 sec),"These are hypocrites who oppose security for you while living their entire lives -- I do it too, to be honest with you, I'm guilty. I'm guilty. I also live behind walls, okay. They live behind walls and gates in their guards all over the place. Me too, because I want to be safe and I want to make America safe, if you don't mind. [Audience chants USA]"
00:53:14 - 00:53:43 (29 sec),"So security should not belong only to the rich and to the powerful, safety is the birthright of every American, which is why we must finish the Wall. It's happening. Because walls are not immoral, as it was said, human trafficking is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Drug peddling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes]"
00:53:43 - 00:54:22 (40 sec),"Child smuggling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Sanctuary Cities that get Americans killed, they're immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Open borders are dangerous and immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] My administration has put forward a compromise that really is a compromise, and I hate even compromise on things like this, but it's showing common sense, it's compassionate, and it's going to solve our problem and the cost is a fraction."
00:54:22 - 00:55:27 (64 sec),"When you look at the drugs that are pouring across from Mexico, if it stopped a small percentage, and it won't, it'll stop a large percentage, it would pay for itself in a matter of weeks. That's the kind of numbers you're talking about, a matter of weeks. And by the way, I -- I hate to say this, because we have a very good relationship, but Mexico had the highest number of killings that they've ever had, almost 40,000 people were murdered in Mexico."
00:55:27 - 00:56:13 (46 sec),"Mexico is not too far away, and we need to take care of our people and we're going to do that and it's happening and it's happening a lot faster than anybody thought. And I love that sign. Thank you. What we're proposing includes humanitarian assistance, drug detection at our ports and everywhere else, closing legal loopholes, which is a big problem, and plans for a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier or wall, let's call it a wall, it's better."
00:56:13 - 00:56:52 (40 sec),"This wall will be built in the areas identified by border agents is having the greatest need while safely directing people and commerce to our many lawful ports of entry, which we're beefing up in every way, structurally, with beefing up the ports of entry and mechanically. We have equipment now that can spot drugs."
00:56:52 - 00:57:31 (38 sec),"It's incredible stuff. It's expensive. It's incredible. By the way, there is nothing better than a good old-fashioned German Shepherd. It's hard to believe, right. It's true you know, I -- I was with the people and they're showing me this incredible computerized stuff and where it goes. I said ""Could I -- ""Because Secret Service took me out to the place and they were showing me these German Shepherds, they're unbelievable."
00:57:31 - 00:58:04 (33 sec),"They'll run past all these empty boxes and one of the boxes has drugs in it, deep down in a box and they come to a screeching halt barking at it every time. So I asked the people that sell the machinery, at a lot of money, so I said, ""Let me ask you a question. This stuff is incredible. I'm really impressed."
00:58:04 - 00:58:47 (43 sec),"How does it compare to a German Shepherd?"" The guy looks at and says, ""Sir, honestly, it's not as good."" Can you believe it? A German Shepard. Certain types of dogs, pretty good. You do love your dogs, don't you? I wouldn't mind having one, honestly, but I don't have any time, I don't have -- How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn, would that be -- Right, sort of not for -- I don't know, it doesn't -- I don't feel good."
00:58:47 - 00:59:23 (35 sec),"It feels a little phony-phony to me. A lot of people say, ""Oh, you should get a dog."" ""Why?"" ""It's good politically."" I said, ""Look, that's not the relationship I have with my people. We want -- "" [Audience members yells something about Obama] Yeah, Obama had a dog, you're right. [Laughter] Both parties should come together to finally create a safe and lawful system of immigration."
00:59:23 - 01:00:13 (51 sec),"The American people have waited long enough. We must secure the border, pass Kate's Law -- end Catch and Release, shutdown Sanctuary Cities -- you know, we need Democrat votes to do that -- deport criminal aliens, and keep the coyotes and traffickers and drug dealers the hell out of our country, please. And the Democrats also need to confirm the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are sitting in the Senate waiting for confirmation, people that have given up their lives to work in the Trump administration and the Democrats aren't approving them."
01:00:13 - 01:00:35 (22 sec),"It's a record. [Audience Boos] It's total obstruction. It's a record of the history of our country there has never been -- Some people left the job a year and a half ago, two years ago, to become an ambassador or to work at one of our many great agencies and we can't get Schumer and his friends to approve them."
01:00:35 - 01:01:00 (25 sec),"It's total obstruction. There's never been anything like it. Very, very unfair, very unfair to these people. In many cases, seriously, they've left jobs and they're waiting and waiting and waiting, they're slow walking every single one of them. It's a disgrace. As we fight to protect our borders we must also protect our newfound prosperity."
01:01:00 - 01:01:42 (42 sec),"My administration has taken the toughest ever action to crack down on years of China's abuse and its trade practices have been very unfair. And I have a lot of respect for President Xi, but he's representing China and I'm representing the United States. We're also replacing one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever done, although I happen to think that the WTO is not so good either, we're replacing NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that everybody is loving."
01:01:42 - 01:02:01 (19 sec),"We've got to get Congress to approve it. We've got to get Congress to approve. We'll get it, I think done. I mean, there's such obstruction in Congress, you know, they won't even do things that are good for our country now. They would rather have Trump have a loss than get something that's so good for our country."
01:02:01 - 01:02:20 (19 sec),"Our farmers are happy, everybody's happy. And it's going to be jobs. You know, what it does? It stops companies from moving out. It makes it very hard economically for companies to say, ""Hey, thanks a lot. We're firing everybody, we're moving to Mexico."" Makes it very, very hard. You know, that's been a bone of contention for me for many years."
01:02:20 - 01:02:47 (27 sec),"I've seen 25 percent and more of our automobile business move to Mexico and it's not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. Unless they want to pay nice big fat tariffs to send their cars back into this country We've achieved, and by the way, tariffs had have had an incredible effect. Just ask the folks in China, ""How are we doing with tariffs?"" You ask."
01:02:47 - 01:03:23 (36 sec),"And you ask, ""How are we doing in our negotiations?"" The fact is, and I say it openly, either they treat us fairly or they have to pay for the privilege of coming in and taking our wealth and taking our jobs, it's very simple. It's very, very simple. And if you look back at our country when we were very rich, when we had no debt, when we had no problems economically, you take back -- you take a look, 1888, the Great Tariff Debate, you know the debate was about?"
01:03:23 - 01:03:45 (22 sec),"Our country had so much money they had to debate what the hell to do with all the money because tariffs were bringing in a fortune into the United States. So at a minimum, countries in negotiating with us very seriously because of the fact that they don't want to have to pay to come in and take advantage of our country, that's at a minimum."
01:03:45 - 01:04:23 (38 sec),"Check it out, 188. Have the press check it out. They'll say, ""Donald Trump said 1888."" [Audience Laughs] We've achieved the largest decline in drug prices in 46 years, prescription drugs. And I'm asking Congress to work with me to make prescription drugs affordable for every American family. We just got the largest decrease in drug prices, think of that, and it's not easy, it's not easy."
01:04:23 - 01:04:43 (20 sec),"Because we have middlemen that take care of a lot of people for a lot of years, these middlemen and the drug companies, but even worse, the middleman, and we're cutting the middleman out. they're not going to like be very much. They made a lot of money. But think of that, they're better the first time in 46 years."
01:04:43 - 01:05:15 (32 sec),"And now we're going to phase three, we did one statutorily, we did two statutorily, now we go to phase three, we're getting your drug prices down. We're embarking on bald initiatives to defeat AIDS. Who knew that? We have medicines now that work wonders on AIDS. We're looking to be AIDS-free in not many years as a country and maybe help, also, the world, the world."
01:05:15 - 01:05:48 (33 sec),"So we want to defeat AIDS and we want to feed childhood cancer. We've made tremendous strides. Tremendous strides. In the Middle East, are brave warriors have liberated virtually 100 percent of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Now, you don't hear that from these people. Now, we've taken back -- soon it'll be announced soon, maybe over the next week, maybe less, but it'll be announced very soon -- we'll have 100 percent."
01:05:48 - 01:06:07 (18 sec),"When I took over this country, it was a mess. And if I wouldn't have been elected -- You know, I have so many people, I was just walking up and every time it happens, ""Sir, thank you. Thank you very much."" This guy, he's -- he's like a monster. No, no, it's true. These people. This guy is like a monster."
01:06:07 - 01:06:28 (21 sec),"He's like this monster football -- a big, strong guy. He says to me, he said, ""Thank you very much."" I don't know what they're saying, but that's okay. Now he's this big, strong guy and he's crying. And he said, ""Mr. -- "" I'm walking up and it happens all the time. ""Thank you very much, Mr. President."" I said, ""For what?"" He said, ""You've saved our country."
01:06:28 - 01:06:54 (26 sec),"Our country was going in the wrong direction. You've saved our country. Thank you."" I've had so many people say that. So many people. You know what the truth is though? I didn't save our country, we're now heading in the right direction. It's very tough because we have so many things were fighting, including these people."
01:06:54 - 01:07:17 (23 sec),"But so many people that we're finding, so many people that are either foolish or ill-intentioned. But you know, I didn't save our county, you know saved our country, you saved our country. You saved our country, and God. Because there's never -- nothing like this has ever happened before. And you know what?"
01:07:17 - 01:07:48 (30 sec),"The world is watching and when prime ministers, and when presidents, and kings and queens, they talked to me they say, ""Congratulations on what's happened with your economy, Mr. President, it's incredible."" They're emulating what we're doing. They can't believe it. So we continue to decimate the remnants, because they're always going to be remnants, we can take the area the land, we'll soon have 100 percent, but they're always remnants, they get out, they wrap themselves in bombs."
01:07:48 - 01:08:30 (42 sec),"They're crazy. They're lunatics. But you're always going to have that. But we want to bring, now -- we've got 100 percent. It was so bad when I took over, it was going the opposite direction. Syria, we want to bring our troops back home. It's time. It's time. It's time. And thanks to the extraordinary service of our military in Afghanistan, 19 years we're in Afghanistan, we may now be able to seek a political resolution that, frankly, they've wanted to talk about for a long time."
01:08:30 - 01:08:55 (26 sec),"We've hit them very hard, but it's been 19 years. Think of that, 19 years. We spend more on military in Afghanistan, $50 billion a year, than most countries spend on their entire country, healthcare, education, everything. We spend more than they do. It's time to start thinking smart for our country. What we want to build our country."
01:08:55 - 01:09:33 (38 sec),"We want to spend money in our country. We want to build our roads, and highways, and bridges, and dams. And last month the United States recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and condemned the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. [Audience Boos] Everywhere socialism has been, everywhere it's been implemented, it's produced poverty, misery, repression, and despair."
01:09:33 - 01:10:35 (61 sec),"You take a look no matter where. Yet, there are those trying to implement socialism right here in the United States. So I, again, say to you -- [Audience Boos] -- and I say it for the world to hear, America will never be a Socialist country, never, never. [Audience chants USA] We're born free. We will live free and we will die free."
01:10:35 - 01:11:20 (46 sec),"We will always be free. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and our great rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American way."
01:11:20 - 01:11:41 (21 sec),"We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our incredible history, and always respect our great American flag. We believe that the first duty of government is to be loyal to its citizens."
01:11:41 - 01:12:18 (37 sec),"And we live by the words of our national motto that we are going to keep -- we'll never change this -- In God We Trust. These are the beliefs, traditions, and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as great patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the great State of Texas."
01:12:18 - 01:13:07 (49 sec),"From Houston to Austin, from Dallas to El Paso -- from the Red River to the Rio Grande, the Lone Star State embodies the spirit of independence like maybe no other place anywhere in the world. And you have always embraced the cause of American Freedom like no one else. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo."
01:13:07 - 01:13:46 (38 sec),"This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzalez, armed with a single cannon, stared down a foreign, powerful army and declared, ""Come and take it."" Come on, come on, take it. Texas is the state where generations of farmers, ranchers, oil workers, and pioneers help build up the most extraordinary nation in all of human history."
01:13:46 - 01:14:18 (32 sec),"That's what we are. We were losing track, we didn't lose track getting more, we're just great on that track. Now, just like generations of Texas patriots who came before, you are going to make your stand. That's what we've done, we've made our stand and we've made it together. This is a big group of millions and millions of people that have come together like never before in our history."
01:14:18 - 01:15:31 (73 sec),"This has never happened before. And we've come for safety, for sovereignty, and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America. And together, with the proud and incredible and great people of the State of Texas, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:01:07 (67 sec),"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much, Grand Rapids. It's great to be back. Right here in America's heartland. You know that, right? With the hard-working patriots from the great state of Michigan. By the way we are bringing a lot of those car companies back. Remember I told you they are coming back?"
00:01:07 - 00:01:47 (40 sec),They are pouring back in. They are coming back. They are coming back fast. This has been an incredible couple of weeks for America. The economy is roaring. The ISIS caliphate is defeated 100 percent. And after three years of lies and smears and slander the Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over.
00:01:47 - 00:02:43 (56 sec),"The Special Counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction. I could have told you that two and a half years ago very easily. Total exoneration. Complete vindication. You know, it's interesting Robert Mueller was a God to the Democrats, was a God to them until he said there was no collusion."
00:02:43 - 00:03:52 (69 sec),"They don't like him so much right now. The crazy attempt by the Democrat party and the fake news media right back there -- And the deep state to overturn the results of the 2016 election have failed, the greatest election that we've had in a long time may be right from the beginning. [Audience Chants Trump] This was nothing more than a sinister effort to undermine our historic election victory and to sabotage the will of the American people."
00:03:52 - 00:04:41 (49 sec),"This is the one we want. We want ourselves. We want us and that's what we got. We came from all over to vote. They've never taken it away from us, never. Never. Our movement took on the political establishment, the corrupt media and it's never been more corrupt than it is today. And many special interests, that's why they tried to do everything possible to take us out but we are very tough to take out aren't we? Very, very, very."
00:04:41 - 00:05:43 (61 sec),"The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and eat illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans, many of them. They suffered with an elaborate hoax. They wanted to destroy a movement like our country has never seen before. That's true. Never seen before. And believe me, if these people thought that that wasn't true, they would be writing it. They've never seen anything like it. Nobody has in this country's history and in most countries histories there has never been anything like what we did in 2016 on November 8. We defeated a very corrupt establishment and we kept our promise to the American people and it's driving them crazy."
00:05:43 - 00:06:08 (25 sec),"Today our movement and our country are thriving. Their fraud has been exposed and the credibility of those who pushed this hoax is forever broken and they've now got big problems. And the harm done to our country -- think of what they've done. Think of the time wasted and yet despite this terrible cloud, this phony, corrupt, disgusting cloud we have done more together in the first two years than any administration in the history of our country."
00:06:08 - 00:06:39 (31 sec),"And this group of major losers did not just ruthlessly attack me, my family, and everyone who questioned their lies, they tried to divide our country, to poison the national debate, and to tear up the fabric of our great democracy, the greatest anywhere in the world. They did it all because they refuse to accept the results of one of the greatest Presidential elections, probably number one in our history."
00:06:39 - 00:07:14 (35 sec),"Many, many people were badly hurt by this scam. But more importantly our country was hurt. Our country was hurt and they're on artificial respirators right now. [Laughter] They are getting mouth to mouth resuscitation. Little pencil-neck Adam Schiff. He's got the smallest, thinnest neck I've ever seen. [Laughter] He is not a long ball hitter but I saw him today well, we don't really know."
00:07:14 - 00:07:32 (18 sec),"There could still have been some Russia collusion. Sick. Sick. These are sick people and there has to be accountability because it's all lies and they know it's lies. They know it. They know it. Jerry Nadler, I've been fighting him for many years. He was the Congressman from Manhattan. I built great things in Manhattan."
00:07:32 - 00:08:16 (44 sec),"I had to beat him many, many times. Now I come here, I have to beat him again. Can you believe? I want every record in the history of the Trump organization. Every single sheet of paper. And what do you have to justify? Nothing. It doesn't matter. We will find something somewhere along the line. A mistake must have been made."
00:08:16 - 00:08:56 (40 sec),"These people are sick. Sick. Every single deal. Every single paper. All of the Democrat politicians, the media bosses bad people. The crooked journalist, the totally dishonest TV pundits and by the way they know it's not true. They just got great readings. By the way their ratings dropped through the floor last night."
00:08:56 - 00:09:35 (39 sec),"Did you see that? And our friends Tucker, Sean, Laura through the roof last night. And all of the current and former officials who paid for, promoted, and perpetuated the single greatest hoax in the history of politics in our country they have to be -- I'm sorry. They have to be accountable. Just think of. A fake, dirty dossier millions and millions of dollars paid for it. By who?"
00:09:35 - 00:10:28 (53 sec),"Crooked Hillary Clinton, the DNC and the Democrat party. Think of it. This is what they used. But they failed. They failed in one way. Can you believe it? Maybe I got lucky. Maybe I got lucky because the fake news they wouldn't put it on. Even they didn't be leave it. Think of it, they spent millions of dollars and the deal was they get it published or printed all of these horrible lies, all now totally exposed as fake."
00:10:28 - 00:11:02 (33 sec),They were going to get it printed just before the election and they couldn't get any of the media to print it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. You never know. You never know. You lose a few vote and that could be the difference but they wouldn't print it so I will tell you on that score I give the media a lot of credit.
00:11:02 - 00:11:33 (31 sec),"It came out after the election and everybody had a big, fat yawn. [Laughter] And I heard about Russia. I'd be running, I'd be hearing -- they'd say something about Russia. I'd say Russia, what does that have to do -- ? This went on. Little -- and then all of the sudden I hear were you involved with Russia?"
00:11:33 - 00:12:08 (35 sec),"I say Russia? What the hell does Russia have to do with my campaign? It's true. Russia. Russia. You know I go up to Wisconsin where she didn't go, she was told you know many, many years, decades, since a Republican one although Bill Clinton said he was in Wisconsin and you'd better get up there, there are a lot of signs up saying Trump Pence, a lot of signs."
00:12:08 - 00:12:28 (20 sec),"A lot of those signs. You'd better get up there darling. And they said no, no, no. Don't worry about Wisconsin because you know Wisconsin the pollsters say we're doing great. They don't come to a place called Michigan. Have you ever heard of Michigan? Michigan. And Bill Clinton said you know I was in Michigan, you'd better get to Michigan."
00:12:28 - 00:13:23 (55 sec),"It's not looking good. They have so many of those damn signs. Every place I look they have the sign on somebody's lawn. You'd better get up to -- know, Michigan hasn't been lost in decades by the Dems. By the Dems. Hasn't been lost. And if you remember this was my last stop. This was it. And I'll never forget this was a spur of the moment because I heard crooked Hillary and Bill, Barack Obama and Michelle -- they were all headed here, right, at the last moment."
00:13:23 - 00:14:04 (41 sec),"They had a tiny, little crowd and I had I'd like to say more but I can't have more than this because every seat is gone and outside you have 25,000 people. And I remember leaving and I said so she's got 500 people and I had 32,000 people including the people outside. I will tell you we have more tonight because outside we have even more than we did then."
00:14:04 - 00:14:32 (28 sec),"And I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning so it's now election day. In fact I actually said am I allowed to do this? It's 1 o'clock in the morning. I had made six speeches and when I heard she was coming I said you know what, what the hell. [Laughter] So it was spur of the moment, last second. We called and we had 32,000 people including all of the people outside."
00:14:32 - 00:15:07 (35 sec),"She had [Inaudible]. I said so let me explain. Let me ask. So she's here at prime time 730, I'm here at one in the morning. She has 500 or 600 people, I have 32,000. Can you explain why am I going to lose Michigan? Why? Why am I going to lose Michigan? Why am I going to lose the great state? I was asking my people."
00:15:07 - 00:15:45 (38 sec),"I get home at 4 o'clock in the morning and I told our great First Lady, soon to be first lady -- and she's doing a great job. They love her. I said you know I have this incredible crowd and I didn't start speaking until 1 o'clock in the morning. I said how the hell could I lose Michigan and guess what we didn't lose Michigan."
00:15:45 - 00:16:32 (47 sec),"And you know what, we didn't lose Wisconsin either. And the fact is we won a lot of places that night. We won Pennsylvania. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won Florida. We ran the East Coast. We won Iowa, you'd better believe Iowa. We love Iowa. We won. We won a lot. We won a lot. Well, we 306 to 223. Would you say that's good?"
00:16:32 - 00:17:11 (39 sec),"I say that's good. Because of here. Remember they said there is no way -- . The day of the election I'm saying you know this is pretty lousy. It's all fake news. You know they are trying to put it in your head. They go there is no way to 270. In other words I needed 270 to win. There is no way for Donald Trump, I wasn't President."
00:17:11 - 00:17:53 (42 sec),"Then, I was a little short of President There is no way on CNN for Donald Trump, remember the red board? It was so red; the red was killing -- they were dying. There is no way for 270 for Donald Trump. It will be a very short evening for Donald Trump there just is no way and they were right. We didn't get 270. We got 306. But in this country -- [Audience chants Four more years] But in this country, we cannot criminalize political differences, political differences."
00:17:53 - 00:18:20 (27 sec),We do not abuse the law enforcement and intelligence power to target our political opponents when they spy on me. Whoever heard of this? They spied on me. They spied on our campaign. Who would think that's possible? The single greatest political hoax in the history of our country and guess what? We won. It's a beautiful thing.
00:18:20 - 00:18:45 (25 sec),"It's a beautiful thing. We love to win. They tried to take something great away from people that came from all over. I always say, they came from the valleys, they came from the mountains, they came out of the damn rivers. I don't know what you were doing in the river but they came from the cities. They came and they came and they didn't even know these people existed."
00:18:45 - 00:19:08 (23 sec),"They are hard-working. They are successful, they are the smartest people, they are the toughest people, they are the most loyal people. They are. They are the smartest. Remember this about yourself. You know I always hear the easily, the release. Well, I always said they said it. I said it here my last night."
00:19:08 - 00:19:42 (34 sec),"I always say they say the easily. They are the elite, I am not. Well, I have a better education than them, I'm smarter than them. I went to the best schools, they didn't. Much more beautiful house, much more beautiful apartment, much more beautiful everything. And I'm President and they are not, right? And then they say the elite, the elite."
00:19:42 - 00:20:07 (25 sec),"They are not elite, you are the elite. We are the elite. I get a kick. I hear so and so the elite. Then you see this guy, like this little schlepper, this is elite? I'm not elite. This is elite. We are the elite. You are smarter. You are sharper. You are more loyal. You are a hell of a lot tougher. A hell of a lot tougher."
00:20:07 - 00:20:29 (22 sec),"So we can't have two different standards of justice in our country. One where the left wing radical establishment can get away with anything they want. But you know, I have to tell you. I said it last night, we have some great, great friends in the media too. You look at Rush and Sean -- And Laura and Steve and Ainsley and Tucker and Jeanine."
00:20:29 - 00:21:19 (50 sec),"Jeanine is back, going to be back on Saturday night. Jeanine, right? And even Greg likes me now. Greg. He started a little slow but he likes Trump. But we have a lot of great support. We really do. We have a lot of great support. Far more than you think but where we really have the support are the voters that pull that handle or whatever the hell they are pulling they are pulling it for us. So the Russia hoax proves more than ever that we need to finish exactly what we came here to do. Drain the swamp."
00:21:19 - 00:21:47 (28 sec),"The Democrats have to now decide whether they will continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bullshit -- Partisan investigations or whether they will apologize to the American people and join us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, bring down the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs which we are doing incredibly, help us fix our broken trade deals which are coming along really well."
00:21:47 - 00:22:14 (27 sec),"We have our team right now in China. They just arrived. China. China. We've gone up, they've gone down but we want them to be healthy. We want them to be happy and healthy. China. And by the way we are building the wall as us -- , we are building that wall. Building -- We are building that wall. [Audience chants build that wall] We had to go down a little bit of a different path but that's okay."
00:22:14 - 00:22:46 (33 sec),"National emergency it is. And if you look at the border and you look at the hundreds of thousands of people that are invading or at least trying to invade our country you would know that we needed and we are building it. And we are building it a lot faster than anybody would -- and better, and better. It's better."
00:22:46 - 00:23:34 (47 sec),"It's faster and it's less expensive. And it's also much more beautiful. And we are building it very rapidly. It's moving along and we renovated vast amounts of wall. A lot of it was in bad shape, we renovated it for 25 cents on the dollar. That's okay, too, right? That's good too. The fake news doesn't want to give us any credit for renovation."
00:23:34 - 00:24:09 (35 sec),"They say even if you rip it down and build a brand-new wall where the wall was, they call that a renovation. That's not a renovation for me. That's not. They do anything they can to -- you're right. Shifty Schiff. They do whatever they can do sort of make it look not so good. We are really doing well but we have a problem."
00:24:09 - 00:25:09 (60 sec),"Our country has never been better economically and people are trying to get in and they have to come in legally and they have to come in based on merit. Based on merit. Despite all that we have been forced to endure every day we are working and fighting and winning. Remember that because we are making America great again and we are making a great for all Americans, all Americans."
00:25:09 - 00:25:35 (26 sec),"And it's getting to be that time, very important. MAGA country. You heard the other day. How about in Chicago? He said -- He said he was attacked by MAGA country. Did you ever hear that one? I don't know -- . May be the only time I've ever agreed with the Mayor of Chicago. That's a terrible situation. That's an embarrassment not only to Chicago."
00:25:35 - 00:26:03 (28 sec),That is an embarrassment to our country what took place there. Remember that. But they are looking at it. So we are delighted to be joined this evening by some really incredible people. People that love you. Members of Congress. Bill Huizenga. Where is Bill? Bill Huizenga. Where is he? Where the hell is he? You didn't get a very good location.
00:26:03 - 00:26:35 (32 sec),"[Laughter] You didn't get a good bill. You did not get a great location but we have some news. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. And Jack Bergman. Thank you, Jack. So here's something good. You ready? In honor of those guys and some of your other representatives and all that we think are fantastic we have some breaking news."
00:26:35 - 00:27:18 (43 sec),"You ready? I don't know. Can you handle it? I don't think you can handle it. I support the Great Lakes. Always have. They are beautiful. They are big, very deep, record deepness, right? And I'm going to get in honor of my friends full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative -- Which you have been trying to get for over 30 years."
00:27:18 - 00:28:02 (44 sec),"So we will get it done. It's time. It's time. It's time. You been trying to get it over 30 years. I would say it's time. Right? Also and as you know this one, we have already pretty much locked up, I'll say locked up. You all understand that because we are very close to getting started on the beautiful new Soo Locks that people have wanted to build for a very, very long time."
00:28:02 - 00:28:39 (37 sec),So we are very close to finishing that one off. And by the way don't let your new Democrat Governor -- or don't let -- Don't let any of our people that find us all of the way now that we have it take credit for it. Okay? Don't let it. Don't let it. You are too smart for that. We are also joined this evening by the Speaker of the Michigan House Lee Chatfield.
00:28:39 - 00:29:22 (43 sec),"Thank you, leave. Thanks, Lee. A person who is doing a fantastic job GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox. And a woman you know very well, she headed up Michigan. They said she was wasting her time, Trump is never going to win Michigan. I said but I'm going to bring back your auto business. Remember? And I did, and I did."
00:29:22 - 00:30:20 (58 sec),"And when we won, I said who is that woman? I want to see her and we put her in charge of the RNC, Republican National Committee. Ronna McDaniel. Ronna. And a friend of mine, he used show but he's very rich he shouldn't be shy. He's one of the biggest builders and real estate people in the world, one of the biggest owners of property."
00:30:20 - 00:30:47 (27 sec),"I shouldn't introduce them because you guys will like him because he's a big owner of property but you own -- you own property, he just owns more of it than you do. [Laughter] And he's a great guy and he's been with me from the beginning, Stanley Chera. Stanley. Those big beautiful buildings in Manhattan."
00:30:47 - 00:31:11 (25 sec),"You know those big beautiful buildings? He owns it. Stanley, how much did you make this month? [Laughter] Stanley is a great guy. Been with us all. He loves you and he's been with us from the beginning and we've had a lot of people with us. We've had people you wouldn't believe we've had a lot of support."
00:31:11 - 00:31:36 (24 sec),"In the last two years we've embarked on an unprecedented economic revival. Unprecedented. America is now the hottest economy anywhere on the planet Earth. There's nobody close. Since our election when the stock market is up almost 50 percent. You are looking like geniuses with your 401(k)s, right? Your wife or your husband is saying darling, you're such a great investor."
00:31:36 - 00:32:15 (39 sec),"How are we doing? We are up 67 percent. Oh, darling, you're so brilliant. [Laughter] In your whole life you've been criticized by her or him but all of the sudden they think you are the single greatest investor. Thank you, Donald. [Laughter] By the way if you want to see those 401(k)s and all of your stocks and all of the things that you own, you want to see them deflate put a good socialist in this position."
00:32:15 - 00:32:55 (39 sec),"Go get yourself a good socialist. You'll see some deflation. You'll see a nice deflate of your stocks and your bonds and your 401(k). We have created since my election 5.5 million new jobs. Nobody would have believed that was possible. Including 600,000 brand-new -- remember, this couldn't happen. You need a magic wand."
00:32:55 - 00:33:22 (28 sec),"Brand-new manufacturing jobs. Well, how did that happen? We were going to have any new man -- it was going down 600,000 and it's going to be increasing by a lot because you have a lot of companies pouring into Michigan and your other great states. A lot. More manufacturing jobs in fact were created in 2018 than in the year in more than 21 years."
00:33:22 - 00:33:58 (35 sec),"That's not bad. That's not bad. And that's not even one of our better statistics. That's actually like at the bottom of the pack. Do you believe me? After years of stagnation wages are rising fast. Do you remember I use to say that people made more money 21 years ago? All of the time and they had one job then they did -- this is two, three years ago, right, than they did working two and three jobs now."
00:33:58 - 00:34:32 (34 sec),"True. But now wages are rising. You have your choice of jobs like I got choice for the veterans, we also got choice for people wanting jobs. So wages are rising substantially for those people. You are doing great but they are also rising most quickly for the lowest income Americans. First time in decades."
00:34:32 - 00:35:07 (35 sec),"And here's a statistic that I love because blue-collar jobs recently grew at the fastest pace in more than 30 years. Whoever thought, right? 30 years. And unemployment has reached the lowest rate in 51 years and soon it will be in the history of our country. 51 years. And to me very important, you remember I use to say what do you have to lose?"
00:35:07 - 00:35:47 (40 sec),"What do you have to lose, right? And I got criticized. You shouldn't say that. I said well, it's true. It's unfair. So importantly to me African-American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment and unemployment among disabled Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:35:47 - 00:36:29 (42 sec),And you remember in the last election they said Donald Trump will not do well with women. I said really? I said really? No. All of the fake news they said you will not do well with women and maybe they didn't want to say they like me to be honest. That I can understand. And then the election came and they said whatever happened to the fact that he wasn't going to do well with women because we did really well with women.
00:36:29 - 00:36:59 (30 sec),"Right? Right? Remember when I was sitting back a couple of them were trying, remember one of the true killers she was crying not from happiness. But we did great with women. We did great with women and I think we are going to do better with women now because you know what? I produced. Because women filled more than 60 percent of all new jobs created last year."
00:36:59 - 00:37:44 (45 sec),"60 percent. Think about. 60 percent. So that means the men better get moving, folks. You are falling behind. The women are -- they are beating you pretty good men. Get going. The women got 60 percent of all of the new jobs. I mean that's an incredible number. We've cut the greatest number of regulations in two years in the history of our country."
00:37:44 - 00:38:20 (37 sec),"Not for two years, in the history of our country. That's one of the things helping us with the jobs. And the United States people don't even believe this, it all happened very recently is now the number one oil and gas producer in the world. Number one. Number one. And by the way Russia is not happy about that but they are fine."
00:38:20 - 00:38:50 (30 sec),"They are doing just fine but they are not happy about that. If Hillary got in you wouldn't have that stat, I can tell you right now. You would be doing wind, windmills and if it doesn't -- if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night. [Laughter] Darling, I want to watch television. I'm sorry, the wind isn't blowing."
00:38:50 - 00:39:39 (49 sec),"I know a lot about wind. I know a lot about wind. We passed massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country. And very importantly for those people with small farms and businesses we got rid of the death tax or the estate tax. So now when you leave your farm or small business to your children under the assumption that you like your children, some people don't. Some people say I wouldn't leave it to them under any circumstances."
00:39:39 - 00:40:15 (36 sec),"I can't stand my kids but for those of you that do which I assume is hopefully a vast majority you don't have an estate tax to pay, they don't. So they can take over your farm, they can take over your business, they don't have to mortgage it to the hilt and then the bank comes in five years later takes it away from your kids."
00:40:15 - 00:40:59 (44 sec),"No tax. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate penalty. The most unpopular part and we are going to hopefully in the court -- in Texas you heard we won the case, now it has to be appealed and then we will go to the United States Supreme Court. We have a chance of killing Obamacare. We almost did it but somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down but we will do it a different way."
00:40:59 - 00:41:32 (33 sec),"You know what, we will do it a different way but we got rid of the individual mandate where you were forced to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to buy bad healthcare. Okay? Not too good. So we are going to get rid of Obamacare. And I said it the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great healthcare."
00:41:32 - 00:41:58 (26 sec),It's good. It's important. And we have created new options to help Americans purchase affordable health plans all across state lines. You now have options you would have never had. The Democrats are pushing socialist government-run healthcare that bans private healthcare for 180 million Americans. Now think of it. A lot of you have private plans and they are great.
00:41:58 - 00:42:28 (31 sec),"They are great and you want that. They want to take them away. That's not going to work. I don't think that's going to work too well. Republicans want you to have an affordable plan that's just right for you and by the way you can use your doctor, remember that? That was a lie. 28 times, 28 times he said that was a lie."
00:42:28 - 00:43:04 (36 sec),"You get cheaper premiums in much lower deductibles. The deductibles and Obamacare are so high on average $7000. You don't get to use it unless a really great tragedy hits and then you don't really want it because you don't give a damn about your deductible, right? You will be in a position where you say who cares about the deductible."
00:43:04 - 00:43:32 (28 sec),"Let's see if I can live. We believe that no one in America should be bankrupted by health care cost and that's what's happening with Obamacare. And remember this because it's very important and I'm speaking now for the Republican party, we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always."
00:43:32 - 00:44:05 (33 sec),Always. My administration has also begun the bold initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and in 2018 drug prices saw their first decline in 46 years. First time. First time. And they will be coming down a lot but this is the first time in 46 years that prescription drugs came down. Even Stanley likes that because he needs plenty of them.
00:44:05 - 00:44:39 (34 sec),"And then we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our amazing veterans. Our amazing veterans. They have been trying to get VA Choice for over 40 years. They couldn't do it. I got it. We signed it six months ago. Now instead of waiting online for one day, one week, two months people that were okay but not feeling well, wait so long that they become terminally ill."
00:44:39 - 00:45:16 (37 sec),"There was no reason for it. Now they go outside, they see a private doctor, we pay the bill, they get better quickly. And for 46 years VA Accountability you couldn't fire anybody in the VA. We had sadists. They took advantage in so many ways of our great veterans. They were rough, they wouldn't have hit them in prime time by the way, not in prime time."
00:45:16 - 00:46:03 (47 sec),"In prime time they would say okay, I don't want to touch you. I'm not going to play. They took advantage of people that are our great heroes that protected us and you couldn't fire them. They stole, they robbed. You couldn't fire them. It didn't matter what you did you couldn't fire them. Called accountability."
00:46:03 - 00:46:40 (37 sec),"We passed seven months ago today we passed VA Accountability. You heard our vets, you stole from us. Guess what, Bill? You're fired. You're fired. Get out. You're fired. And to give former prisoners a second chance I proudly signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. They have been trying to do that for so many years."
00:46:40 - 00:47:12 (33 sec),"So many years. Very unfair. And by the way some of the people that most supported it are the most conservative people you've ever seen. Both, both sides. Very bipartisan believe it or not for a change. But while we are pushing and pursuing all of these commonsense policies to advance the common good for our citizens Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism, resistance."
00:47:12 - 00:47:47 (34 sec),"Resist. Resist and revenge. Revenge. What do you think of their signs resist? What the hell? Let's get something done, right? Resist. Resist. Resist. Isn't that weird? You know you are looking to have a parade that's called resist. You say what the hell does that mean? No, no. We want to do legislation. There are so many things we can be doing together."
00:47:47 - 00:48:20 (33 sec),The Democrats are now advancing an extreme $100 trillion government takeover called the Green New Deal. But I'd rather not talk about it tonight because I don't want to talk them out of it too soon. [Laughter] Because I love campaigning against the Green New Deal. I want them to make they do a big part of their platform.
00:48:20 - 00:48:53 (33 sec),"No more airplanes, no more cows. One car per family. One car. You're going to love that in Michigan. Hey, how do you like the idea of one car per family? You know, I don't think one car per family in Michigan plays too well. Do you agree? Right? Not too well. And it's got to be of course an electric car even if it only goes what, 160 miles?"
00:48:53 - 00:49:27 (34 sec),"What do you do, it's 160 miles? Darling, where do I get a charge? Where do I get a charge, darling? No. We want to have a lot of cars per family. We want people to lead a great life and we want people to make those cars and we want all of these companies to keep coming to Michigan and all of the other great states and building those [Inaudible]. And we had a problem because when they didn't want the airplanes they were saying well, how do you get to Europe?"
00:49:27 - 00:49:57 (29 sec),"Nobody knew. How do you get to Australia? Nobody knew but they are working on it and then they were interviewing this woman from Hawaii, the Senator. The one that was so vicious about Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. Remember? By the way, do we love Justice Gorsuch and do we love Justice Kavanaugh?"
00:49:57 - 00:50:25 (29 sec),"She was so vicious to both and these are great people. She was vicious and they hit her. She didn't know about the Green New Deal and they hit her and she's from Hawaii. What do you think of the Green New Deal? It was just put up by the Democrats. Well, I like it very much but she never saw it. Then they said but you can't fly anymore and she's in Hawaii."
00:50:25 - 00:50:51 (25 sec),"She said but how would I get to my island? They said we are working on some kind of a train system. [Laughter] So she said okay, well then, I am for it 100 percent. It is the craziest thing I have ever seen. They want to rip down all of the buildings in Manhattan and rebuild them. Let's do that. Hey, Stanley, how do you like that idea?"
00:50:51 - 00:51:16 (25 sec),"I don't think so. I don't think Stanley likes that idea too much. It's the craziest thing but you know what, let's let them -- . It's like I attack so violently Pocahontas and -- And I knocked her out of the race I guess and I said what did I do that for? It's too early. I've got to start in about nine months from now."
00:51:16 - 00:51:42 (27 sec),"We've got plenty more to knock out, you're right. They just keep coming, don't they? They just keep coming. Before I took the oath of office the United States automobile industry was decimated and it was going down and you people knew it better than anybody else. We lost one in four auto manufacturing jobs over the last few decades."
00:51:42 - 00:52:21 (39 sec),"Think of it, one in four and I think the numbers were worse than that and so do you. But from the moment I entered the White House my first meeting was a meeting with car executives. I said what do I have to do to get your business going? We talked about CAFE standards where they were choking the engines, just choking them and costing a lot more for the cars and we had a great meeting and we worked on it and worked on it. We took historic and dramatic action to save the American auto industry and to defend American auto workers right here in Michigan."
00:52:21 - 00:52:55 (34 sec),"Right. And just in the last very short period of time we have added another 6000 vehicle manufacturing and auto parts jobs in Michigan alone and prevented thousands more from being shipped overseas and from going to Mexico. They can't do that anymore. Can't do that. Can't do that anymore. Sorry, Mexico."
00:52:55 - 00:53:22 (26 sec),"We want them to give us a little more help on the border by the way. You know Mexico has the toughest immigration laws in the world. We have the worst because the Democrats put in things that are so bad, so bad. Catch and release. You catch them and then you got to release them. Think of it. Visa lottery."
00:53:22 - 00:54:08 (46 sec),"You are in a lottery system from these countries. You pick up a name. Isn't that nice? Guess what? Do you think they are giving us their best people? No, they are not. They are giving us their worst people and so would you and so would I. Visa lottery. That's another beauty. We have nothing but bad coming out of those laws but you know the good thing about what's happening, the rush to the border, another two caravans now are pouring up. Mexico could stop them so easy and you know what?"
00:54:08 - 00:54:49 (41 sec),If they don't it's going to cost them a hell of a lot of money honestly because they could do it so easy. So easy. And if they don't and I'm telling you right now we will close the damn border. [Audience chants USA] And I don't know if you know it or not Michigan but Mexico took about 30 percent of your car business.
00:54:49 - 00:55:09 (20 sec),Not when I was here. When I'm here they are not. It's going the other way. 30 percent and if we close the border that means we are not taking those cars into our country and what does that mean? That means you are going to make more cars right here in the good old USA. That's what it means. Right? Very simple.
00:55:09 - 00:55:37 (28 sec),"It's all very simple. People try and make it too complicated. It's all very simple. One of the gravest threats to the survival of the U.S. auto industry was the job-killing, sovereignty-wrecking Trans-Pacific Partnership. It was going to decimate your industry. That's why one of my very first acts in office was to withdraw our country from that horrible potentially disastrous trade deal."
00:55:37 - 00:56:06 (28 sec),"And stop the offshoring of Michigan jobs. Saved a lot of jobs. That was a disaster. That would have been almost as bad as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world. NAFTA. That was a beauty. Your empty factories are still all over the place. They still haven't recovered from NAFTA. Well, NAFTA is going to be a thing of the past."
00:56:06 - 00:56:35 (29 sec),"Soon. Or we will just go to pre-NAFTA, that was okay, too. We had a huge surplus with Mexico, then we did NAFTA. We lost over the last six, seven years with Mexico $100 billion. Before NAFTA, we made $40-$50 billion. Doesn't sound like too good a deal, right? So we have now the USMCA and it's very good."
00:56:35 - 00:56:57 (22 sec),"If the Democrats want to raise their hand -- it's a hard thing for them to give us a victory but let's see if they raise their hands otherwise, we go to pre-NAFTA. We don't go to NAFTA, we go to pre-NAFTA. That was just okay with me. That was okay with me. A short time later I traveled to Detroit to cancel burdensome regulations that unfairly harm the motor city."
00:56:57 - 00:57:22 (26 sec),It was getting decimated. We renegotiated the U.S. Korea trade agreement to double the American auto exports to Korea. We doubled them. They were not happy about it. And to stop the cheap foreign pickup trucks from flooding our market. That's your best market. Do you know why? Because we have a chicken tax.
00:57:22 - 00:57:52 (30 sec),"We have a tariff, 25 percent and that's why it's your best market because they can't come in here and take away your business and take away your jobs. They weren't thrilled but that's okay. Under my administration we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American. And we are already seeing good results."
00:57:52 - 00:58:31 (39 sec),"Since the election we have created more than 55,000 brand-new motor vehicle and auto parts jobs in our country. 55,000. Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion investment in Michigan including the first new auto plant in Detroit in over a generation. And they are going to be investing in our country $13.5 billion over a very short period of time."
00:58:31 - 00:59:09 (38 sec),"And Ford has just announced a $1 billion investment just outside of Chicago as well as additional $900 million going right here in Michigan. And I've been a little bit disappointed with them because everyone else is coming in but General Motors did just announce a $300 million investment at its Orion assembly plant here in Michigan, right now."
00:59:09 - 00:59:47 (38 sec),"But I'm also fighting with General Motors and the UAW to take swift action on the GM plants at Hamtramck and Warren, Michigan and Lordstown, Ohio. Get the damn plants open. Everyone else is coming in. Get them open now. Right? So with companies like Chrysler and Ford and Toyota and Volkswagen all investing heavily in America and heavily in the state of Michigan we think General Motors will soon be doing the same."
00:59:47 - 01:00:19 (32 sec),"I really do believe it. You know they went before my time they went to China, they spent a lot of money building stuff. They went to Mexico. They spent a lot of money building stuff. That's not helping us much. So we think they are going to come around. As we protect our jobs, we are also protecting America's borders and we are taking on the extremist and they are really radical, radical extremist Democrats who want open borders in crime because that's what happens."
01:00:19 - 01:00:43 (24 sec),"Open borders and crime. Last month alone more than 76,000 illegal immigrants arrived at our borders to be apprehended. We have to apprehend them. Do you know what a great job -- I mean seriously think of that, 76,000 people many of which are rough people. Okay, I'm being nice because they will criticize me if I'm not."
01:00:43 - 01:01:14 (31 sec),"They will say how dare he say that. But we have people that have criminal records. We have a lot of people. We have a lot of problems. We apprehend them. We capture them. Do you know how tough that job is, border patrol? You know how tough? I don't think any of you guys here -- yeah, you would. That guy would like it. There are some people would like it. They love it. The great American patriots and ICE, these are great American patriots."
01:01:14 - 01:01:33 (20 sec),"And we are on track for 1 million illegal aliens trying to rush our borders. It is an invasion, you know that. I say invasion. They say isn't that terrible? I don't know what these people are thinking. You know, it's your country two. What are you thinking? 300 Americans a week die from Mexican-trafficked heroin."
01:01:33 - 01:02:08 (35 sec),"300. Think of it, 300 a week. Tens of thousands of Americans are killed every year by heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, vast quantities of which are smuggled across our southern border. You know that. 78,000 people died and that's a number that's much, much smaller than the real number. To confront the border crisis last month I declared a national emergency on our southern border."
01:02:08 - 01:03:01 (53 sec),The radical Democrats retaliated by passing a reckless resolution to terminate vital border security operations. Can you believe this? In two weeks ago I proudly issued my first veto. And two days ago our great Republicans in the House of Representatives -- I won't get fancy with you I will just say they essentially gave us the right to build the wall and lots of money is pouring in. So we are building the wall.
01:03:01 - 01:03:34 (33 sec),We will be finishing the wall. It's moving along rapidly. We are giving out many additional contracts. We are going to be building it in many different locations simultaneously with different contractors. And sometime over the next two weeks I will be going to a certain place which I won't tell you now because they will be waiting for me. I will be going to a certain place and we are going to be showing you mast sections of brand-new beautiful walls.
01:03:34 - 01:04:02 (28 sec),"Because we are going to put the job to safety and to security of American citizens first. And you know when I campaigned it's going to be so much easier the second time. Remember this, I never did this before and I am one and one, right? We are 1 for 1. 1 for 1. [Inaudible] and it was tough. It was tough."
01:04:02 - 01:04:22 (20 sec),You know why? Because I get up on a stage and I've never debated before but I never left center stage. Right? Never left center stage meaning we were winning the whole time and I debated and I said where are these people coming from but I never did it and I never said to anybody I'm going to produce jobs.
01:04:22 - 01:04:48 (26 sec),I'm going to bring back your auto business. I'm going to do great for the vets. I'm going to do great for tax cuts. I'm going to cut regulations more than anybody in the history of our country in two years. I never said -- I couldn't say that. But I did say that I was going to do it but who the hell's going to believe me? Now I've done more than I ever promised I was going to do so the debate should be very easy.
01:04:48 - 01:05:32 (44 sec),"Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis. [Audience chants four more years] Thank you. Well, I'll give you a question, okay. So I told you before the lowest unemployment rates in the history of our country for African-American great citizens. Now I say that and it's like I say that and I just say your turn, what the hell are they going to do to beat that?"
01:05:32 - 01:06:05 (33 sec),"And we have many other things for every single citizen, everybody is benefiting. Everybody. Everybody is benefiting. So before -- so before first election, my first election. What the hell? I never did it before. I did a good job though do you think? So did you. So did you. You know the fact is we did it together and I've always said it. I didn't do it. We did it together."
01:06:05 - 01:06:48 (43 sec),"But -- but think about it now instead of saying I'm going to do this I'm going to produce 5.5 million new jobs, I'm going to bring back manufacturing 600,000 new jobs in a short period of time. Now I've done it. I mean it should be easy don't you agree? It should be easy. Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis for one simple reason because they have cause the border crisis and you know why else?"
01:06:48 - 01:07:21 (33 sec),"Honestly because they want boats and because they don't want to give us a win. They don't want to give us a win. They put that ahead of what's good for our country. The mass illegal immigration across our border is a direct consequence of Democrats supported loopholes, Democrat promises of amnesty, amnesty."
01:07:21 - 01:08:02 (41 sec),"You have people coming up here you know they are all met by the lawyers, the lawyers and they come out, they are all met by the loiterers and they say the following phrase I am very afraid for my life. I am afraid for my life. Okay. And then I look at the guy, he looks like he just got out of the ring, he's a heavyweight champion of the world, he's [Inaudible]. It's a big fat con job, folks."
01:08:02 - 01:08:41 (39 sec),"It's a big fat con job. And Democrat sanctuary cities and their refusal to protect American borders it's not the money. When I fought for them recently, they gave me so much money for everything else but nothing for the wall. Now think of it. Walls work, folks. We need the wall. They said would you call it slats?"
01:08:41 - 01:09:14 (33 sec),I said I'll call it slats. Would you call it steel barriers? I said I'll -- I said I'll call it whatever the hell you want just give me the money to build it and then they sort of got a little cold feet and now I call it the wall and I got the money anyway. So that's over. But there open border policies are truly a betrayal to the American people.
01:09:14 - 01:10:04 (49 sec),"This is dangerous what's coming into our country is dangerous. To defend the United States of America I deployed the United States military. I got thousands of troops. Right now we have about 4000 troops on our southern border and they are fantastic. And think of it, or years we defended the borders of foreign countries but we don't want to defend our own borders."
01:10:04 - 01:10:41 (38 sec),"Think of how crazy this is. We are defending borders of countries that are 6000 miles away that many of you have never even heard the name of these countries but our southern border, our border along Mexico where we have a lot of problems in drugs and human traffickers and child traffickers and all of this coming in, we don't want to defend our border."
01:10:41 - 01:11:12 (31 sec),"Think of that, how crazy that is. So now we are defending our borders for our country and the people of our country. In the last two years alone ICE officers -- we love ICE, have made listen to this though, 266,000 our risk of criminal aliens. Who the hell wants to do that? You don't want to do it, right?"
01:11:12 - 01:11:48 (35 sec),"You like what you are doing making cars, right? I like making cars I think better, too. But they like it. That's what they do. They are great at it including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,006 crimes, 4000 kidnappings and 4000 murders. Okay. We got them. They got them. How about if you don't get them?"
01:11:48 - 01:12:09 (21 sec),"How about if you leave all of those people? You know what that means for us don't you? The Democrats want to abolish ICE. They want to get rid of these very great patriots, these very tough people that love our country as much as anybody I've ever seen. They want to set violent offenders free and directly they will be coming in to your communities."
01:12:09 - 01:13:04 (55 sec),"We are not going to have it. We are not having it. We want our country to be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not for criminal aliens. Right? The Republican Party will always stand with the heroes of ICE and the heroes of Border Patrol. These are great people. Every day of my Presidency ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens and we are either throwing them behind bars or throwing them the hell out of our country."
01:13:04 - 01:13:35 (31 sec),"And we are throwing out gangs like MS 13. These are some of the sickest, most demented, most vicious people in the world. We are throwing them out of our country by the thousands. In recent months the Democrat party has also been aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion of allowing children -- to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth."
01:13:35 - 01:14:08 (33 sec),"And now we go a step further in Virginia. The Governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby, wrap the baby up, make the baby comfortable, to be executed after birth. That is why in my State of the Union address I called on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting the extreme late-term abortion of babies."
01:14:08 - 01:14:43 (35 sec),"The Democrat Party has never been further outside of the mainstream. They are being brought so far left you wouldn't like it folks. You wouldn't like it. You won't be happy. Radical Democrats are the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, hoaxes and delusions. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans."
01:14:43 - 01:15:12 (29 sec),"It's what we want to be. It's the way we want to live. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream. And every day we make good on the motto promises made, promises kept. Last week I signed in order to defend free speech on college campuses. And to keep America safe we are rebuilding America's military might making it more powerful than ever before by far."
01:15:12 - 01:15:37 (25 sec),I withdrew the United States from the horrible costly one-sided Iran nuclear deal and look what happened. Iran is a different country today than it was two and a half years ago. I recognized Israel's capital and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And just days ago I announced that the United States will recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
01:15:37 - 01:16:05 (28 sec),Very important. Very important. We also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and we strongly condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. We stand with the people of Venezuela and Cuba and Nicaragua and their righteous struggled to finally be free. We stand with them. Doing a lot of work.
01:16:05 - 01:16:46 (41 sec),"Socialism is not a good thing, you are right. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and the American rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way."
01:16:46 - 01:17:36 (49 sec),"We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, to honor our history, to be proud, to be happy, to love and always to respect our great American flag. [Audience chants USA] And we believe in the words and always will, we are not changing it, they want us to change a lot of things it's not happening of our national motto in God we trust."
01:17:36 - 01:18:25 (50 sec),"In God we trust. These are traditions, customs and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the magnificent lands of Michigan. These are the values that brought the incredible people of this incredible state to Grand Rapids for the very last rally of the 2016 campaign, probably the most exciting and hopefully the most fruitful campaign in the history of our country."
01:18:25 - 01:19:01 (36 sec),"On that historic day you rejected the failed political establishment that chipped away your jobs, sold out your sovereignty and tied us down in endless foreign wars which we are now winning and getting out. You stood up to the corrupt special interest and you stood up to the rigged Washington power structure."
01:19:01 - 01:19:53 (51 sec),"You have stood with me. You watched this rigged power structure. You were with me. I won't forget it and you will be very proud looking back that you did it. Thank you. You took back your country. You recaptured your destiny. You defended your dignity and you proudly reclaimed your freedom, maybe for a second time."
01:19:53 - 01:20:46 (53 sec),"You have always been loyal to your nation and now you have a President who is loyal to you 100 percent. The Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted but with us you will never ever be forgotten again. You will never be taken for granted ever, ever, ever. I am fighting for you and your jobs in your life in your community with everything that I have and I will never ever stop and we are winning so big."
01:20:46 - 01:22:21 (95 sec),"Nobody ever thought it could happen. We will always fight on to victory. Together we are going to make our beautiful stand. We are going to stand for justice, for safety, for sovereignty and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people and one United States of America.Because together with the very proud and very truly incredible and inspiring people of Michigan we will make America wealthy again. And we are doing it. We will make America stronger again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michigan."
00:00:00 - 00:00:28 (28 sec),"Shabbat, Shalom. Thank you. What a great day. Thank you, Norm, for that wonderful introduction and for your leadership of this truly tremendous organization. So many friends, I have so many friends out in the audience. Thank you very much for being here. [Audience cheers] Thank you. Thank you. [Audience cheers] Thank you very much."
00:00:28 - 00:02:11 (103 sec),"He's going back home to mommy and he will be reprimanded, he will be, right. She gets it. I'm truly thrilled to be back with so many friends, supporters, patriots, at the annual conference of the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is now setting records. Records. Here today is someone who has been with us from the very beginning, a true fighter for our shared values, your terrific Executive Director Matt Brooks."
00:02:11 - 00:02:43 (32 sec),"Thank you, Matt, thank you. Thank you, Matt. Also joining us are two great leaders. You know very well my good friends Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, great people. They like you both, Sheldon, it's pretty good. Last year was my honor to award Miriam The Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's a big deal. I also want to thank Senator Lindsey Graham, he's here, senator."
00:02:43 - 00:03:50 (68 sec),"Where's Lindsey? Senator Lindsey, great man, great friend, great friend of Israel. Thank you, Lindsey. A man who fights all the time for Israel and for everything else. Another great Senator David Perdue, Georgia. Senator Kevin Cramer. Where's Kevin? Kevin, Kevin, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. He fought a battle, you wouldn't believe it. He beats somebody by 11 points, that was unbeatable."
00:03:50 - 00:04:22 (31 sec),"That's pretty good, Kevin. I said, ""You can do it."" That was my only thing. I said, ""You could do it."" He won by a lot. He won by a lot, and he's a great gentleman and he's a big, big fan and supporter of Israel. As well as a really terrific leader, he's our leader, Kevin McCarthy. And we have representatives that are outstanding."
00:04:22 - 00:05:06 (45 sec),"The great Billy Long. Where's Billy? Billy? Billy Long. Denver Riggleman. Denver, thank you. Thank you, Denver. Michael Waltz. Thank you, Michael. Great job you do, Mike. And a very good friend of mine also, Lee Zeldin. And a special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota. Oh, oh, I forgot. She doesn't like Israel, I forgot, I'm so sorry, oh. No, she doesn't like Israel, does she?"
00:05:06 - 00:05:45 (39 sec),"Oh, please, I apologize. A great friend of mine, one of the most successful men in the state, amazing guy, tremendous businessman, Mr. Phil Ruffin. Where is Phil? Phil? Thank you, Phil. A competitor of mine in Manhattan for a long time, always built great buildings, great architecture, was known for design and success, loves Israel, George Klein."
00:05:45 - 00:06:11 (26 sec),"Thank you, George. Thank you, George. So many friends in Israel. We're also grateful to be joined by members of my administration, including Jason Greenblatt, and a young man named Jared Kushner. He is fighting for Israel. Thank you very much, great job. Peace in the Middle East. If they can't do it, nobody can."
00:06:11 - 00:06:35 (24 sec),"David Friedman, your ambassador to Israel. He loves Israel, so an incredible job. Thank you, David. Finally, to every member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, thank you for your incredible support and your outstanding commitment to our country, to our safety, and to electing more Republicans. We need more Republicans, let's go so we can win everything."
00:06:35 - 00:07:07 (32 sec),"Over the next 19 months, I know that the Republican Jewish Coalition will help lead our party to another historic victory. And by the way, we did very well at 18, you can ask David and Lindsey, we won the Senate. We took on two more. There were three or four that were very close, that weren't supposed to be. All of a sudden that didn't happen and we're going to talk about that, I think, when we get back to Washington."
00:07:07 - 00:07:29 (22 sec),"But I'll tell you what, we picked up two Senate seats and now it's 53 to 47. And we have 53 great senators, and when it comes to appointments, when it comes to the United States Supreme Court, when it comes To approving all of the judges way over a hundred judges, federal judges, you need the Senate, we did well."
00:07:29 - 00:07:58 (29 sec),"They don't like to talk about that. They don't like. And I don't have enough time so many people in the house, but the people I went for, like in Kentucky, Matt Barr, he's -- he won. He was down and he won. We won so much. We won in Georgia, great Governor Brian Kemp. They had President Obama, they had Oprah, they had Michelle Obama."
00:07:58 - 00:08:17 (20 sec),"They were going for their new star, their new star of the party, and I was going for Brian. All he had was Trump. You know what, Brian won. Brian won. And the governor of a great state, known as Ohio, you have a great governor. He was not expected to win. He campaigned brilliantly. We did some incredible rallies."
00:08:17 - 00:08:55 (37 sec),"He won by almost seven points, he won easily. So Mike is great. And the governor of Florida. Governor of Florida. That was supposed to be a close race and was a tough race, but we won that one and Oklahoma, and many other places, we did so well. We get no credit, fake news, we get no credit. We get no credit, let's just keep winning."
00:08:55 - 00:09:26 (32 sec),"I'd rather have it that way they get too much credit and not win, that happens true to some people, doesn't happen to me. When I spoke to you as a candidate three years ago, America's economy was stagnant. Our military was depleted and the relationship between the United States and Israel was at probably the lowest point in history."
00:09:26 - 00:09:53 (26 sec),"How the hell did you support President Obama? How did you do? How did you do it? How do you support the Democrats with you guys [Inaudible]. I think, probably most of the people in this room that, ah, you love Israel, but you know, you look at the Iran deal. You look at so much that was done so negatively."
00:09:53 - 00:10:28 (35 sec),"Now, just three years later, I stand before you as the president of the United States to report on a very different situation under Republican leadership. America's economy is the hottest anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. Our military will soon be more powerful than ever before, $700 billion, $716 billion this year."
00:10:28 - 00:10:57 (29 sec),"I don't know, David and Lindsey, I think, probably in the 750 to 725 range, have to do it. You don't have the military. You owe the stuff, doesn't matter, does it, huh? You don't have to worry about inflation. You don't have to worry about anything. You got to have a strong, strong military. We'll have the strongest that we've ever had before."
00:10:57 - 00:11:26 (29 sec),"And the incredible bond between the United States and Israel has never been stronger than it is right now. America's thriving, America's booming, and America is winning, winning, winning like never before. We're respected again, we are respected again. It's been a long time. Since the election, we've created more than 5.5 million new jobs, including 600,000 manufacturing jobs."
00:11:26 - 00:12:14 (48 sec),"Things that nobody would have allowed me to say on the campaign trail. They would have said, ""Oh, he exaggerates."" After years of stagnation, wages are rising fast. Think of it, people had one job 21 years ago. They made more money in real dollars than they did two years ago, with three jobs, and two jobs, and now, for the first time, they have a choice, our economy so strong."
00:12:14 - 00:12:35 (21 sec),"They can have a choice of jobs and wages are going up, first time in many, many years. And one of the things that makes me happiest, frankly, is that they're going up most quickly for the lowest income Americans. Great. Great? Great. Our unemployment has reached the lowest level in more than 50 years and we will be breaking that record, I believe, pretty soon."
00:12:35 - 00:13:02 (26 sec),"We slashed 30,000 pages of job killing regulations from the federal register, an all time record. It doesn't matter if they were there for four years or eight years or 10 years, in one instance. We really did something. We had -- take a look at FDR, all of those years, all of those years. Nobody slashed them like as yet a fourth-termer."
00:13:02 - 00:13:36 (35 sec),"You have a lot of two-termers and in less than two years -- and I happen to believe that that was as important and maybe even more important than the largest tax cut in the history of our country. Thank you also. We're fixing broken trade deals, we're working on a trade deal now with China, we're doing very well, very well because of tariffs."
00:13:36 - 00:14:10 (34 sec),"We're making a deal that's very good, you'll, be happy if it happens, might not happen, but we have tremendous power. We have to tell our people that represent us in Washington that when countries -- I'm not talking about China, I'm talking about many countries. When they're charging us 100% tax or tariff."
00:14:10 - 00:15:09 (59 sec),"When they're charging us 200 and 250 and 300%, and we charge them nothing, it's OK to charge them something. Maybe you could explain that to some of your people that say, ""Oh, we don't like tariffs."" I mean, we have a case where a certain country, India, is charging us. We're a great country, a great friend, Prime Minister Modi charging us over a 100% for many things."
00:15:09 - 00:15:52 (43 sec),"We're charging them nothing for similar or the same product, and I have senators that say you can't do that. It's not free trade. Where do they come from? Where do they come from? It's not free trade. I don't know. Where's David? You got to work on this pretty well, David. You -- Where's Lindsey? He used to work on that."
00:15:52 - 00:16:32 (40 sec),"It's the craziest thing. Its stupid trade. We have so much stupid trade. We lost, for many years now, $800 billion a year on trade. Who the hell makes these deals? You're, probably saying yourself. Those are not good negotiators. Actually, Democrats made a lot of money, but Republicans met a lot of them too."
00:16:32 - 00:17:02 (29 sec),"That's amazing thing, they made a lot, 800 billion, but we're getting it back, we're getting it back. We're going to be getting a lot of it. One thing, if they let me really do my thing, we'd get it back, but I have to be a little bit politically correct by saying, ""It's OK if we lose 20 billion with a country."" You know, because we want to be nice, wouldn't it be nice to everybody."
00:17:02 - 00:17:27 (25 sec),"We're cracking down on countries that cheat. We're replacing NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA. NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made. You know, many of you, people have factories and plants, they're still empty. They signed NAFTA, and it was that great, big, sucking sound."
00:17:27 - 00:18:13 (46 sec),"Remember that? Remember that? Ross Perot, a great big, sucking sound, it's what happened. They left, they went to Mexico, they went to Canada, they went to a lot of places. It was a bad thing for us, but we'll be ending NAFTA, hopefully very soon, very soon. And one of the things in the new deal is that it's very difficult financially for a company to leave the United States, fire all of its employees, move, let's say, to Mexico or Canada, open up a new plant, make a product, sell it in for no tax, so we end up with unemployment and nothing but loss and empty factories."
00:18:13 - 00:18:48 (35 sec),"That's not happening anymore, folks, not happening. We've ended the war on American energy and the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, bigger than Russia and bigger than Saudi Arabia, can you believe that? Can you believe that? Three years. Thank you very much."
00:18:48 - 00:19:27 (40 sec),"And we're working now on getting pipelines approved in Texas that would normally take 10, 12, 14, 15 years to get approved, and we're trying to get him approve very rapidly. And if we do that, we're going to pick up another 20 to 25%, we'll be leading by so much. We already are leading by a lot. So it all happened over a very short period of time and we've confirmed more than 100 new federal judges to interpret the Constitution as [Inaudible] And as Norm said, and I appreciate that, so important, Norm."
00:19:27 - 00:20:07 (40 sec),"We have confirmed two incredible Supreme Court justices, Neil Gossage and Brett Kavanaugh. Don't let the Democrats take it away from us, they'll take it all away, they'll take it all away, including the judges. With the help of Republicans in Congress, we have secured record funding for our military. Our military is now going to be stronger than ever before."
00:20:07 - 00:20:38 (31 sec),"Ever. Not even close we're developing new weapons systems, we're developing things that nobody even thought of. Levels of technology that nobody else has with all of that being said, if we can be smart, and if China and Russia, and maybe one or two others, if necessary, can be smart, we'd all be saving a tremendous amount of money, and that's OK with me, but we will be so far in the lead."
00:20:38 - 00:21:06 (28 sec),"We always have to be in the lead and thanks to our focus on burden sharing, $100 billion, more dollars, will be coming this year to NATO, think of that. Other countries, in certain instances, were getting an almost free ride. We protect them and they're delinquent. You know, I used a real estate term for George Klein."
00:21:06 - 00:21:30 (24 sec),"He understands it. He understands. We were delinquent. They were delinquent. I said, ""You got to pay."" President Obama got -- made a nice speech, but he forgot to mention you got to pay. President Bush was wonderful, they didn't mention, you got to pay and you got to meet it, not just mentioned you got to mean it. I said you got to pay, because we're in a position."
00:21:30 - 00:22:19 (48 sec),"Everybody wants us, but how do you do that when people aren't paying? How do you do that? We feel foolish. We feel like fools. We're not going to be fools anymore. We've been a fool as a nation for so long, we're not going to be fools anymore. Last year I withdrew the United States from one of the most dangerous one-sided deals ever negotiated the disastrous Iran nuclear deal."
00:22:19 - 00:22:44 (26 sec),"They wanted to kill Israel, they wanted to destroy Israel. And maybe you could explain to the young man that just got taken out what it means when a country shouts as they're signing the deal Death to Israel. Maybe you could explain that to him. We've now imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian dictatorship, and it is not the same country it was when I took power."
00:22:44 - 00:23:10 (26 sec),"When I took over the presidency, I will tell you, one of the first meetings I had was at the Pentagon. Great generals, great people. I wanted a briefing on Iran with 14 different sites, they're all very, very dangerous, blow ups, all over. They were either behind it, hey had mercenaries, they had money or they had their own soldiers there all over the Middle East."
00:23:10 - 00:23:37 (27 sec),"It's a whole different story today, folks. They have riots in the streets. They have very little money coming in. A lot of things have changed. North Korea, we're getting along with North Korea. Let's see how it works out, but we have a good relationship. Don't forget, I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un. When I first came in, they were setting rockets and nuclear explosions and a lot of things were happening."
00:23:37 - 00:23:55 (18 sec),"I can't tell you what's going to happen, how to walk from the one deal. Was it going to be a right deal, but -- but we have a great relationship, we'll see what happens, I hope we're going to be able to do something. Maybe, maybe not, but I hope we're going to be able -- Relationship is very important, you know that very well."
00:23:55 - 00:24:30 (35 sec),"We're confronting the deadly menace of radical Islamic terrorism. When I took office, just over two years ago, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. I held up a map, it was so much red. Red, meaning, them. All red, showing the different sites. Today, the ISIS caliphate has been 100% obliterated."
00:24:30 - 00:25:03 (33 sec),"100%. And my previous generals said, ""That it was going to take, sir, it will take two years."" I flew to Iraq. I met a different group of generals, ""Sir, we can do it in one week."" I said, ""You could take a little longer than that."" They did it in a few weeks. They were -- They are great, right? Raisin Cain."
00:25:03 - 00:25:26 (23 sec),"He's name is Raisin. ""What's your first name?"" ""Raisin."" ""Raisin? What the hell kind of -- What's your last name?"", ""Cain."" ""Wait a minute,your name is Raising Cain? I like you as a general."" I think -- that it's what I want. Even Sheldon Adelson likes that decision. The kind of guy he'd have. I also took another historic action that had been decades in waiting."
00:25:26 - 00:26:11 (44 sec),"The United States recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Because, unlike other presidents, I keep my promises. Every president, for many decades, said they were going to do that, and I understand really why. Because when it was determined that maybe I'd do it, maybe there was a chance."
00:26:11 - 00:26:47 (36 sec),"The calls I got from leaders of other countries were unbelievable. Presidents, dictators, prime minister, kings, queens, everybody, my phone was ringing off the hook. So I knew I was going to do it, so I left a message. I said, ""I'm going to call you next week."" They said, ""Could we speak to him soon?"". ""No, no. No, he's not available."" They'll call it lying."
00:26:47 - 00:27:11 (25 sec),"The fake news will say, ""That's a horrible lie."" I want to be nice. ""No, no I'll call you next week. I look forward to it."" I had so many calls after this. It took me like three weeks to make all the calls, but I knew what they were calling about. So I did it. I did it. Then I started calling people back."
00:27:11 - 00:27:43 (31 sec),"King, how are you, how have you been? ""I called you last week."" ""So what's up?"" ""Well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel and the embassy in Jerusalem."" I said, ""Look, I'm sorry, wish I would've known. I did it, I did it yesterday."" Right, it's much easier, but I now know why other president -- I don't really hold it against him other than they didn't keep their promise, right?"
00:27:43 - 00:28:15 (33 sec),"They didn't keep their promise, David. So that's the way it is, and we got you something that you wanted. I can tell you, Sheldon and Miriam, that is the most important thing, I think, that's ever happened in their life. They love Israel. So, I can now understand, because I always said, ""Why wouldn't they do it, why?"
00:28:15 - 00:28:48 (32 sec),"Why are they doing it? Why wouldn't they just do it?"" They campaign, ""We will do this and that -- Israel, Israel."" Then you folks go out and vote for them and then they don't do it, right? Four years, eight years, didn't matter, they won't do it, but you know what, they did it. We did a great job and we feel great about it. And then last week, Israel security, really so important."
00:28:48 - 00:29:20 (32 sec),"It's all about security, when you get right down, it's about security, so is No. 1 for me. I got to talk. We can talk healthcare we could talk a hundred different things without security. What does it matter? I stood with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyahu. How is the race going by the way? How is it? Who is going to win the race?"
00:29:20 - 00:29:44 (25 sec),"Tell me, I don't know. Well, it's gonna be close. I think it's gonna be close. Two good people, two good people. But I stood with the prime minister at the White House to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights is something I've been hearing about for a long time, the Golan Heights."
00:29:44 - 00:30:11 (26 sec),"So, I just talked to your Ambassador Friedman and not about this, they've been trying to get that approved, as you know, for 52 years they wanted recognition from the United States of the Golan Heights. They had 32 summits, meetings, big meetings over many, many decades about the Golan Heights. I'm talking to your ambassador."
00:30:11 - 00:30:43 (33 sec),"Gerard was there, Jason Greenblatt was there. I said, ""Fellas, do me a favor, give me a little -- a little history, quick, wanna go fast."" I got a lot of things I'm working on, China, North Korea. Give me a quickie. Norm, I said, ""Give me a quick little slice -- so I know it as well as Norm, but I don't want to spend quite as much time as he has spent studying it, but -- which has been his entire life, right?"
00:30:43 - 00:31:05 (22 sec),"So that 32 different summits, he starts going well. We need that as a high point, we need it for protection we need it for -- I said, I could -- How do you like the idea? They weren't even calling about this. How do you like the idea of me recognizing exactly what we're discussing? Because I agree, you need it. You need to hide, you need to hide."
00:31:05 - 00:31:41 (36 sec),"The great generals said, ""Always fight downhill. Never fight, uphill."" Battles are lost, for these generals want to fight uphill, right? You need to hide. So I said, ""David, what do you think about me recognizing Israel and the Golan Heights?"" He said, ""Would you actually do?"" It is a great deal because one of the most successful lines was gave it all up. In order to be your ambassador gave it all up. ""What do you think of it David?"" And he goes -- and this is a very strong, ambitious guy."
00:31:41 - 00:32:19 (38 sec),"He like it like a wonderful, beautiful baby, he said, ""Do you really -- You would do that, sir?"" I see -- I think, I'm doing it right now. Let's write something out. We make fast decisions and we make good decisions. Look, I made -- I made a lot of good decisions, I make good decisions and we get something beautiful talking about security."
00:32:19 - 00:33:04 (44 sec),"Talking about the greatness of Israel and I went, ""Bing, it was done."" Then I watched well look at all those cameras. Then I watched the fake news and they said, ""We have breaking news. President Trump has just committed to the Golan Heights."" And it was a big big story for two days. Everyone's happy, no repercussions and there won't be. I went there to protect Israel, so there won't be. We did the right thing, we did the right thing."
00:33:04 - 00:33:21 (18 sec),"And I want to congratulate Jared, and Jason Greenblatt, and david Friedman and all of the people they work with. And a big thing for me, and some of you won't like this maybe, but I would love to see peace in the Middle East, I would love to see peace in the Middle East. And if those three can't do it, you'll never have it done."
00:33:21 - 00:33:50 (28 sec),"It's never -- with me as president, with them doing the deal, you'll never have it done, so let's see if we can do it, who knows. Under my administration, the United States will always support Israel's right to self-defense. At the United Nations we no longer tolerate any form of anti-American, anti Israel, and anti-Semitic bias."
00:33:50 - 00:34:22 (32 sec),"We don't do it. For example, the United Nations Human Rights Council has repeatedly denigrated America and Israel. Why -- and you know this you've heard this while ignoring the world's worst human-rights abusers. That's why I withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights Council, and thank you to Nikki."
00:34:22 - 00:35:21 (60 sec),"Thank you to Nikki. Terrific job, Nikki Haley. With your help, we are making incredible strides on behalf of the American people and we are just getting started. [Audience cheers] Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And that guy that just said that, he used to hate me. Can you believe that? He used to hate me. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. But while Republicans fight to protect the jobs and safety of all Americans, Democrats are advancing the most extreme partisan agenda by far in American history."
00:35:21 - 00:36:10 (48 sec),"You see what's happening. You see what's happening. People aren't fighting for Israel in Congress, large numbers of people. You saw what took place three weeks ago. It was shocking that couldn't have happened. It could not have happened just a few years ago, could not have happened. If implemented, the Democrats radical agenda would destroy our economy, cripple our country, and very well could leave Israel out there all by yourselves, can't do that more than 100 Democrats in Congress are promoting the biggest government power grab in U.S history."
00:36:10 - 00:36:56 (46 sec),"The $100 trillion Green New Deal, proposed by a wonderful young bartender, 29 years old, 29. No, I like her, she's 29 years old. We take trains to Europe, Hawaii and Australia. That's a problem. The farming business is in big trouble, right. The auto business you get one car, somehow Detroit etc., you know bring in so many car companies in. I don't think they're going to be thrilled to hear that."
00:36:56 - 00:37:14 (18 sec),"We are -- we're built -- I tell you what, when you look at what's happening with the car companies, they're opening up in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and South Carolina, it's amazing, what's happening, we want to keep it going. You know, they could destroy what we've built very quickly."
00:37:14 - 00:37:43 (29 sec),"It does it -- that's why having Lindsey and David and all of the people that I mentioned, and so many more back in Washington really want to stop it, and we've got to win the election, we're going to win it, we're going to win a big. It will never be as easy as it looks. Over 120 congressional Democrats are also supporting a socialist takeover of our healthcare system that would take away private insurance."
00:37:43 - 00:38:11 (28 sec),"If you take a look at this, 180 million people will lose their private health insurance. And you're finally happy, you're happy. We've done a lot of work on that, you're happy. The radical Democrats are also pushing for a thing called -- If you can believe this, open borders. They want open borders, they want people to pour into our country."
00:38:11 - 00:38:42 (31 sec),"Last month, more than 100,000 illegal migrants were apprehended at our border. Apprehended. Think of this, hundreds of thousands of people. And we're on pace to apprehend more than a million illegal migrants this year, a million they're coming up because of the economy they're coming up because our laws are so bad from the Democrats."
00:38:42 - 00:39:09 (27 sec),"Catch and release you catch 'em and you release 'em. Oh, that's wonderful. If they put one foot on our territory, if they start climbing a fence and they're on the Mexico side. Welcome to the United States, think of it. It's the craziest thing. They have a visa lottery. Democrats, a visa lottery, a lottery, countries, a lottery."
00:39:09 - 00:39:53 (43 sec),"You pick out a name. Do you think they're putting their finest? Do you think they're putting their great people there? No and then people come in and you see what happens with the crime and murders, 4,000 murders last year, four thousand. How stupid can we be to put up with this? How stupid can we be? And the asylum program is a scam, some of the roughest people you've ever seen, people that looked like they should be fighting for the UFC."
00:39:53 - 00:40:23 (30 sec),"They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place, you know, my lawyers, they tell them what to say. You look at this guy, you say, ""Wow, that's a tough cookie."" I am very fearful for my life. I am very worried that I will be accosted if I was sent back home. No, no he'll do the acoustic."
00:40:23 - 00:40:59 (36 sec),"Asylum. Oh, give him asylum, he's afraid, he's afraid. We don't love the fact that he's got tattoos on his face, that's not a good sign. We don't love the fact that he's carrying the flag of Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador only to say he's petrified to be in his country. To confront this border crisis, I declared a national emergency."
00:40:59 - 00:41:29 (30 sec),"And David Perdue and Lindsey Graham helped me, a lot of people helped us. When congressional Democrats tried to reverse my order and terminate vital border security operations, I very proudly issued my first veto and they were not able to turn over the veto. So now we have -- in fact we have billions of dollars."
00:41:29 - 00:41:52 (24 sec),"We've started building walls -- actually, a while ago, from the first 1.6 billion and renovation of a lot of walls, we can do that a lot cheaper. We had walls that were potentially very good, but they were in very bad shape, they were old, we renovated it. We have got a tremendous amount, we're going to put out list, but we will have hundreds of miles before the end of next year."
00:41:52 - 00:42:29 (37 sec),"Hundreds of miles. And yesterday I traveled to the border in Calexico, California, and I saw a section of brand new 30 foot high steel wall, you want to be able to see through it. Got to see through it, got to see who's on the other side, beautiful wall, looks great, looks great. Walls build good neighbors, right."
00:42:29 - 00:42:48 (19 sec),"Now we we have to take care of ourselves and I have to say I said I was going to close the border. It's gotten so bad. I said we're closing the border and as soon as I said that, and I really thank the president of Mexico because they stepped up and now they are apprehending people on their southern border."
00:42:48 - 00:43:27 (39 sec),"Coming in from Honduras, El Salvador, and various other places,Guatemala and I stopped paying almost $600 million to those three countries. Now I got a lot of heat. The Democrats say, ""How dare you do that?"" That money is used for all these good, but no it's not it's largely stolen. I sent 600 million, we do, 600 million to three countries and they form caravans."
00:43:27 - 00:44:00 (33 sec),"Now, if the government wanted to, I have a feeling they'd be able to stop caravans from forming in those three countries. I have a feeling they're, pretty tough they're, pretty tough ad, but they did say, stop the payment. Do you mind? Are you okay with it? Because I've taken -- I've taken a lot of heat from the stupid people that say, ""Oh gee, we should keep..."" We have people that work with them that say we should be sending much more money."
00:44:00 - 00:44:22 (22 sec),"We should be building things they're, helping them. What about building our own country for a change? Wouldn't that be nice? Unfortunately, Democrats have refused to close immigration loopholes, that's really what it's all about. And again, Mexico is apprehended 14,000 people yesterday, a thousand people today, before they've never done this."
00:44:22 - 00:44:45 (23 sec),"Never to the extent, and I appreciate it, I appreciate it, but if they don't do it, I'm going to close the border or I'm going to do tariffs or the cars made in Mexico. They took 30% of our car business, by the way, I wasn't here when that happened, OK. I used to complain about it as a civilian. I complain, I said, ""What the hell is going on? They're taking our business."" They have 30% of our cars."
00:44:45 - 00:45:14 (30 sec),"They make 30% of our cars, they send them into our country, no tax, no nothing, essentially, and we lost a lot of jobs, but we're getting them all back now, we're getting more back. But I said we're either going to tariff those cars coming in at 25%, which is a tremendous amount of money. It's all about the cars, the cars are a big deal or we're going to close the border, and I will say this, Mexico has been great."
00:45:14 - 00:45:35 (21 sec),"The last four or five days, they've been great, first time first time. At the heart of, and I don't mind, closing the border. I'd say, you know, a lot of these fakers back there they say, ""He will never close the border."" It's too much. Well, you know, close the border. We stop about $500 billion worth of drugs from pouring into our country."
00:45:35 - 00:46:16 (41 sec),"You know, there are a lot of advantages too, a lot of advantages. I'm OK with it. I don't want to do it, but I'm OK with it, I'll do it. I'll do whatever is necessary to stop an invasion of our country. That's what it is. At the heart of the crisis are the 9th Circuit rulings in the Flores case and the Trafficking Victims, Protection Reauthorization Act, driving a staggering surge of illegal families and minors into the hands of our incredible border patrol people."
00:46:16 - 00:46:41 (25 sec),"They've done an incredible job. What they do is incredible, I was with them yesterday. So Congress must end catch-and-release so that illegal border crossers can be quickly and safely returned to their home. Get out. Sorry, get out, sorry, can't handle it. And I told my people yesterday, our country's full, we're full."
00:46:41 - 00:47:17 (35 sec),"Our systems full, our country is full, can't come in, our country is full. What can you do? We can't handle anymore? Our country is full, can't come in, I'm sorry, it's very simple. Never before has a major political party been more outside the American mainstream than the Democrats of today. They have become the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, witch hunts, and delusions."
00:47:17 - 00:47:45 (28 sec),"And now the Democrats have even allowed the terrible scorch of anti-Semitism to Take root in their party and in their country, they have allowed that, they have allowed that. House Democrats recently blocked legislation to confront the anti-Semitic movement to boycott and sanction Israel. Nobody could believe it, right."
00:47:45 - 00:48:15 (30 sec),"Nobody. You couldn't believe it. Republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism. We do, all of us. Earlier this year, I appointed a new special envoy to monitor and combat Anti-Semitism. We are grateful that he has joined us today, Elan Carr. Where is Elan? Thank you, great job, Elan."
00:48:15 - 00:48:47 (32 sec),"Elan is as good as I hear, he's going to do a great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Congratulations. At my State of the Union address. I was honored to have as our guest a Pittsburgh SWAT officer, brave guy. I was with him in the hospital who raced into gunfire during the horrific anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue."
00:48:47 - 00:49:48 (61 sec),"He was shot seven times badly injured. He endured 12 surgeries and he's gonna have to endure quite a few more. We are proud to have him here with us right now. If he wasn't there as bad as it was, as horrible as it was, it would have been much worse. He is a brave man, Timothy Mattson. Please stand, Timothy."
00:49:48 - 00:50:14 (26 sec),"Timothy. I saw him right after this horrible event, this horrible happening, and he was laying in the hospital he had bullet wounds all over, he's a massive guy. I looked at the chest, I mean, he's got like this and it's muscle. Thank God, you're massive and thank God, you had a lot of muscle because very few people got to take it when you took Timothy, and your friends had such respect for him."
00:50:14 - 00:50:44 (29 sec),"His fellow officers they had such respect. Thank you. Glad to see you better. That's great. Glad to see you better. Amazing what he what he went through. Today we also honor two more American heroes, Mordechai Lichtenstein and [Inaudible], I love that name. Both from Brooklyn. I know Brooklyn very well, my father Fred Trump, I loved my father."
00:50:44 - 00:51:14 (30 sec),"Brooklyn. Spent a lot of time in Brooklyn. You learn a lot in Brooklyn. You get through Brooklyn, you got to be smart. Two years ago, Mordechai and [Inaudible] traveled to Jerusalem, where they prayed at the Western Wall. Soon after they left the holy site, they saw a terrorist stabbing an innocent Israeli police officer, racing to the scene."
00:51:14 - 00:51:57 (43 sec),"Mordechai pull the attacker off the soldier and was about to be stabbed himself. It was happening when the badly wounded officer summoned the little strength that he had left and shot and killed this very violent terrorist. [Inaudible]] immediately took his prayer shot and wrapped it around the officer's wounds to stop the bleeding, which was profuse after the attack, the officer said of the two Jewish Americans."
00:51:57 - 00:52:41 (45 sec),"They were sent by God to save my life. For me, my family and the Druze people of Israel. I thank God from the bottom of my heart. That's the officer, thank you, Mordechai, [Inaudible], where are you? Stand up. Great job, thank you. Great job, great job. Thank you very much. Recently, Mordechai and [Inaudible] became the first non-Israeli citizens to receive the country's civil, exemplary declaration."
00:52:41 - 00:53:17 (36 sec),"That's a big deal. To Mordechai and [Inaudible] you are an inspiration to all of us to everyone in this room to everyone in our country. Thank you very much. The three American heroes we recognize today are a powerful reminder of the timeless values that bind us together. As one nation, and that forge deep and lasting friendship with the people of Israel, we honor our history."
00:53:17 - 00:54:22 (65 sec),"We treasure our traditions, we cherish life, we love our families, we defend our sovereignty, we fight for our freedom and we place our trust in the hands of Almighty God. These are values that unite us all as Republicans as citizens, as patriots, and as proud Americans. Every day of my presidency, we fight on behalf of hardworking citizens who pay their taxes, follow our laws, raise their children, protect our communities and make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of earth."
00:54:22 - 00:55:08 (45 sec),"This government is their government, and this land is home. These American patriots have always been loyal to our country, and we will forever be loyal we swear to them. The choice for our country's future has never been clearer than it is today. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans. It will be the party for great healthcare, you watch."
00:55:08 - 00:55:44 (36 sec),"We are the party of the American worker, we are the party of the American family and we are the party of the American dream. Alongside our friends at the Republican Jewish Coalition, we will keep on working. We will keep on fighting and we will be winning, winning, winning for the American people. With your help on November 3, 2020. Can you believe?"
00:55:44 - 00:56:19 (35 sec),"It's right around the corner. Think of it. Right around the corner. [Crowd cheering.] Thank you very much. We're going to win. By the way. One of the people, and then that was confirmed by somebody else today on the other side Democrats were saying that they would reinstate -- just reinstate the Iran nuclear deal."
00:56:19 - 00:56:51 (32 sec),"Well, this is what you have. They want to reinstate the deal. It was a disaster for our country. We gave $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. What does that look like? Airplanes loaded up with cash, how stupid was that deal, they want to reinstate it. Republicans are going to win the White House, we're going to retake the House."
00:56:51 - 00:57:20 (29 sec),"We're going to keep the Senate and we are once again going to be in a position, in my opinion, like never ever before, stronger than we've ever been before. There is more spirit for the Republican Party right now than I've ever seen. They keep talking about the spirit of the Democrat Party, there's more spirit for Republicans."
00:57:20 - 00:58:08 (48 sec),"In my opinion, by far, we may express it somewhat differently and that's OK, more spirit than I have ever seen, and I've now been doing this for a little while, not too long. I'm one for one, that's one for one. I want to be two for two and then relax. Together with the love, the prayers, and devotion of everyone in this room, incredible people and the millions of patriots across our land, we will make America great again for all Americans greater than ever before."
00:58:08 - 00:58:13 (5 sec),"Thank you, and God bless you all. God bless America. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:25 (25 sec),"Well, you better love me; I kept this place open, that I can tell you. They said, ""We're closing it."" And I said, ""No, we're not."" And now you're doing record business. The job you do is incredible. And I'm thrilled to be here in Ohio with the hardworking men and women of Lima."
00:00:25 - 00:00:43 (18 sec),And this is some tank plant. There's nothing like it in the world. You make the finest equipment in the world. You really know what you're doing. They just gave me a little briefing on a couple of those tanks. I want to get into them but then I remember when a man named Dukakis got into a tank.
00:00:43 - 00:00:59 (17 sec),"[Laughter] And I remember him; he tanked when he got into the tank. [Laughter] He tanked -- I never saw anybody tank like that. So I said, maybe I'll -- but I'm a little bigger than him; I think it probably would work out okay. How would I look in a tank? Okay? Yeah, not bad. Not bad."
00:00:59 - 00:01:26 (27 sec),"The helmet was bigger than he was. That was not good. [Laughter] We're here today to celebrate a resounding victory for all of you, for northwest Ohio, and for our great military, and for our entire country. Incredible victory. After so many years of budget cuts and layoffs, today, jobs are coming back and pouring back, frankly, like never before."
00:01:26 - 00:01:59 (33 sec),"Companies are coming back into our country; they want the action. Production is ramping up in the biggest way. And the awesome M1 Abrams tank is once again thundering down the assembly line. A-1. I want to thank Acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan. He's done an incredible job. In fact, ISIS -- let me tell you about ISIS."
00:01:59 - 00:02:01 (2 sec),They're not doing so well.
00:02:01 - 00:02:20 (19 sec),"You know, we took over the caliphate. You'll see it tonight. When I came in, it was a mess. Where the hell is that chart? [Laughter] Folks, they gave me all economic charts. They didn't give me the ISIS chart. But if you did -- bring it up if anybody has it. Bring it up. When I took over, it was a mess. They were all over the place."
00:02:20 - 00:02:42 (21 sec),"All over the -- all over Syria and Iraq. And you'd see it was a sea of red. And now you look at it and there's no red. No red. And you look at some of the economic numbers; nobody thought we'd ever see numbers like that in our country -- not a for a long time, not for ever. And what we're doing has been incredible."
00:02:42 - 00:03:07 (25 sec),"What you're doing has been more incredible. You stuck it out and now you've got one of the most successful military plants anywhere in the world. It's great. So thank you very much, Pat Shanahan. Also thank you to the Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper. He's been fantastic. Thank you. Oh, good."
00:03:07 - 00:03:23 (17 sec),"Better late than never. [Laughter] Here's the story: So, you know, I donât want to have them make a big chart because it costs too much. You know, I'm a business guy. They said, ""Sir, we could make a big chart."" I said, ""How much does it cost?"" Like it matters. But it matters to me. Does that make sense to you?"
00:03:23 - 00:03:23 (0 sec),[Audience calls out Yeah]
00:03:23 - 00:04:03 (40 sec),"So, two maps, identical -- except the one on top was Syria. See that? The one on top was Syria in November of '16. You remember that date? November of '16. November 8th. We had a little victory that night. We had a little victory. But a lot of us werenât surprised by it, but the other side said, ""Where did all of those people come from?"" [Laughter] And I said, ""They just didn't like candidates for a lot of years."
00:04:03 - 00:04:28 (25 sec),"They didnât vote."" So what happens is -- this is all ISIS. Now, on the bottom -- that's as of today -- this is ISIS. There's none. The caliphate is gone, as of tonight. Pretty good. Thatâs pretty good, right? We took over a mess. We took over a mess with North Korea. We took over a mess in the Middle East."
00:04:28 - 00:04:46 (18 sec),"We took over. A lot of bad things were happening and the economy was not doing well. It was heading in the wrong direction. You remember that. It was going to go bad, and then we opened up with the regulation cuts and all of the other things we've done, including the big tax cut. But it made a big difference."
00:04:46 - 00:05:10 (24 sec),"Made a big difference. And we'll show you some numbers in a little while. I want to also thank Major General Brian Cummings for the incredible leadership and service you have done. An unbelievable job. Thank you, Brian. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're also honored to be joined by several of the Ohio leaders, friends of mine -- terrific people: Senator Rob Portman."
00:05:10 - 00:05:46 (36 sec),"Rob, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Rob. A man who I will never, I promise, wrestle. He was one of the best wrestlers in the history of college wrestling. His record is so ridiculously good. I said, ""Were you as good as Dan Gable?"" He said, ""No."" See, if it were me, I wouldâve said, ""Yes, I was much better."" [Laughter] You know who Dan Gable is. Jim Jordan, a great guy."
00:05:46 - 00:06:11 (25 sec),"And a great champion. A great, great athlete. Great champion. Thank you. He is tough. You'll want to have him on your side. Another one you want on your side always is Mike Turner. Mike, thank you. Thank you, Mike. Great. Warren Davidson. Warren, thank you. And, Bob Latta, thank you very much."
00:06:11 - 00:06:45 (34 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Warren and Bob. And a man who we're very proud of because, along with Mike, he ran a great race: Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted. He ran a great race for Governor. We came in that final day -- they were a little bit down, against a tough opponent, who I was not a big fan of, and I didnât like the people that were supporting him too much -- Pocahontas and others."
00:06:45 - 00:07:01 (16 sec),"[Laughter] And I came that final day, and we had a day that was incredible and they won by -- what did you win by? Six or seven points, right? It was an incredible -- huh? Even higher. Thatâs pretty good. Good. I'll see Mike in a little while. Thatâs great. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Proud of you."
00:07:01 - 00:07:29 (28 sec),"To our plant leaders, Lieutenant Colonel Travis Adkins and Henry Kennedy -- we appreciate everything you do to keep the Army âRolling Alongâ full speed ahead. Incredible job. We're grateful to General Dynamics -- incredible company -- Phebe Novakovic. How did I do with that one?"
00:07:29 - 00:08:01 (32 sec),"Novak-ovic. It's a little tricky, but thatâs okay. What a job you do. Thank you. Great job. Thank you for the tour, too. And the hardworking members of the United Auto Workers. Now, you've got to get over to a place that I like a lot, Lordstown. And you've got to get that. You know, the only place -- General -- what's going on with General Motors?"
00:08:01 - 00:08:20 (19 sec),We have the best economy we've ever had. We have the lowest employment -- unemployment that we've had in 51 years; soon will be the record of all time. And what's going on with General Motors? Get that plant open or sell it to somebody and theyâll open it. Everybody wants it. Sell it to somebody or open it yourselves.
00:08:20 - 00:08:43 (23 sec),"Get it going now and the UAW will help you. The UAW -- you're going to help. The UAW just promised they're going to help. Get it open now. Don't wait. They said they have discussions coming up in September, October. I said, why not tomorrow? Why not on Monday? What do you have to wait months for?"
00:08:43 - 00:09:05 (22 sec),"Get the discussions going. Get it open. Lordstown is a great area. I guess I like it because I won so big there. [Laughter] But we're doing a job, and this state has been -- we're very proud of what's happened in Ohio under our federal auspices. We've gotten so many things done, and this plant is one of our great achievements."
00:09:05 - 00:09:47 (42 sec),"To all of our active-duty service members and our wonderful veterans, thank you for serving your country -- with such tremendous distinction and honor. And to every welder, and machinist, and assembler, and mechanic, and engineer, and electrician, and carpenter, and every patriot here at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center: Thank you for pouring out your heart and your sweat and your soul to help restore the might of the American military, which very soon will be stronger than it ever was."
00:09:47 - 00:10:16 (29 sec),"We've bought billions and billions of dollars' worth of new planes and tanks and many other things. So, thank you all. Great job. And the fact is we have the best tanks driven by the best soldiers, made by the best workers anywhere in the world. And thatâs true. A lot of people are asking, because they love me, and they ask me about a man named John McCain."
00:10:16 - 00:10:21 (5 sec),"And if you want, I could tell you about -- should I or not? Yes? Yes? [Audience calls out Yes]"
00:10:21 - 00:10:51 (30 sec),"So, I have to be honest: I've never liked him much. Hasnât been for me. I've really -- probably never will. But there are certain reasons for it, and I'll tell you. And I do this to save a little time with the press later on. John McCain received a fake and phony dossier. Did you hear about the dossier? It was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton."
00:10:51 - 00:10:53 (2 sec),Right? [Audience Boos]
00:10:53 - 00:11:14 (21 sec),"And John McCain got it. He got it. And what did he do? He didnât call me. He turned it over to the FBI, hoping to put me in jeopardy. And that's not the nicest thing to do. You know, when those people say -- because I'm a very loyal person. John McCain campaigned for years to repeal and replace Obamacare -- for years, in Arizona."
00:11:14 - 00:11:40 (26 sec),"A great state. I love the people of Arizona. But he campaigned, for years, for ""repeal and replace."" So did Rob and so did a lot of senators. When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against ""repeal and replace."" He voted against, at 2 o'clock in the morning. Remember ""thumbs down""? We said, ""What the hell happened?"" He said, two hours before, he was voting to repeal and replace."
00:11:40 - 00:12:08 (28 sec),"And then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican Party, badly hurting our nation, and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable healthcare. We would've had it. This would've saved our country over a trillion dollars in entitlements, and we would have ended up making a great healthcare plan, frankly, with the Democrats because they would have had no choice."
00:12:08 - 00:12:41 (33 sec),"McCain didnât get the job done for our great vets and the VA, and they knew it. That's why, when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got Choice and I got Accountability. Accountability -- meaning, if somebody mistreats our vets -- for 45 years they were trying -- they mistreat our vets, and we say, ""Hey, you're fired."
00:12:41 - 00:13:01 (20 sec),"Get out."" You can't mistreat our vets. They never got it done. And Choice -- for year and years, decades, they wanted to get Choice. You know what Choice is. You're a military person. You're one of our great people. To me, one of the great people. For many decades, they couldnât get it done."
00:13:01 - 00:13:26 (25 sec),"It was never done. I got it five months ago. I got it done -- Choice. Instead of waiting in line -- a vet fought for us, fought in these tanks; fought for us. Instead of waiting in line for two days, two weeks, two months -- people on line, they're not very sick. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill."
00:13:26 - 00:13:53 (27 sec),"We gave them Choice. If you have to wait for any extended period of time, you go outside, you go to a local doctor. We pay the bill; you get yourself better. Go home to your family. And we got it passed. We got it done. And the other thing is we're in a war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush -- President Bush -- all the time: ""Get into the Middle East."
00:13:53 - 00:14:20 (27 sec),"Get into the Middle East."" So now we're into that war for $7 trillion. Thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we're straightening it out now, but it's been a disaster for our country. We've spent tremendous wealth -- tremendous wealth -- and tremendous lives in that war."
00:14:20 - 00:14:42 (23 sec),"And what do we have? It's worse than it was 19 years ago. I call them the ""endless wars."" Nineteen years ago, when we started. So, John McCain loved it. I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted -- which, as President, I had to approve. I donât care about this. I didnât get ""thank you."" That's okay."
00:14:42 - 00:15:06 (24 sec),"We sent him on the way. But I wasnât a fan of John McCain. So now, what we could say is: Now we're all set. I donât think I have to answer that question, but the press keeps, ""What do you think of McCain? What do you think?"" Not my kind of guy. But some people like him, and I think that's great. Now let's get back and let's get on to the subject of tanks and this economy."
00:15:06 - 00:15:41 (35 sec),"Because you know what? We love what we are and what we do more than anything else. We build great, we fight great, and we're right now in Lima, and Lima is an incredible place, a place of strength and dedication. Since 1941, this plant has built and serviced thousands of tanks and military vehicles that powered American forces through World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan."
00:15:41 - 00:16:14 (34 sec),"And the tanks are the best in the world -- better than ever before. Every single Abrams tank in existence -- the steel and the aluminum warhorse; theyâre really a warhorse of American ground forces -- it was built or serviced on these very grounds by you people. By you people. But under the previous administration, this tank factory -- the last of its kind anywhere in the Western Hemisphere -- came very close to shutting down."
00:16:14 - 00:16:40 (26 sec),"Four straight years, the number of U.S. tanks that were budgeted for upgrades was zero. Does anybody remember that? Raise your hands. Do you remember that? Zero. That was under your great President Obama. Our military readiness declined and your workforce was slashed by 60 percent. But those days are over."
00:16:40 - 00:17:09 (29 sec),"We are rebuilding the American military. We are restoring American manufacturing. And we are once again fighting for our great American workers. Over the last two years, we have secured nearly $1.5 trillion to provide our warfighters the finest aircraft, ships, missiles, and tanks anywhere on Earth. We make the best equipment on Earth."
00:17:09 - 00:17:38 (29 sec),"And we sell that equipment, as you know, to good allies. Although, sometimes the good ones turn out to be not so good, and then we do something. We figure it out. You know what you have to do? You figure it out. This year, weâre asking for an additional $750 billion, which is a record. That includes funding to upgrade more than 160 mighty M1 Abrams tanks."
00:17:38 - 00:18:12 (33 sec),"Congratulations. Congratulations. These historic investments are making America safer and our workforce stronger. From the awe-inspiring F-35 fighter in Texas to the Ford-class aircraft carriers in Virginia -- weâre now building the largest aircraft carrier anywhere in the world. In fact, Iâm hearing itâs actually the largest ship ever built."
00:18:12 - 00:18:40 (29 sec),"It is seriously big. I was there recently. Itâs something -- itâs like landing at an airport, although you have to be very talented, still, to land on those decks, no matter how you figure it. Some people can do it and some people can't. Some very good pilots can. To advance missile defense systems in Alabama, American workers are building the most cutting-edge, modern, and powerful military anywhere on the planet."
00:18:40 - 00:19:02 (22 sec),"At the heart of our military rebuilding is our investment in the legendary M1 Abrams tank. And I will tell you, the investment has paid off because the technology is so -- if you look at this tank from now, and you go back 10 years and look at the tank, itâs a like a whole different -- itâs a whole different deal, isnât it? A whole different deal."
00:19:02 - 00:19:24 (22 sec),"Over the next three years, weâre investing more than $6 billion in upgrades and modifications to these tanks -- thatâs going to keep you very busy here -- almost twice the amount spent in the entire eight years of the previous administration, which was going down to nothing. Because you were closed; this place was closed."
00:19:24 - 00:19:45 (22 sec),"And I heard about it. And I got calls from Jim Jordan and Rob, and everybody, saying, âYou just canât do this.â And after I studied the situation, I said, âWeâre not only not going to close in Lima, weâre going to expand.â And thatâs what took place. So you owe a lot to a lot of your great political leaders."
00:19:45 - 00:20:21 (36 sec),"Our investment -- our investment in you is also a tremendous win for American taxpayers. By modernizing this plant and accelerating production, we will bring the cost down by 20 percent, saving taxpayers nearly $3 million on every single tank. Thatâs not bad. With the help of everyone in this room, we are giving our warriors the most effective, reliable, and lethal battle tank in the history of war."
00:20:21 - 00:20:52 (31 sec),"Would you say thatâs correct? So how does this compare with the tanks made in China and Russia and other places? What do you think? Can we take them? They say itâs much better. America does not need conflict. But if conflict comes, and you know the story -- youâve got to be strong if conflict comes -- we will dominate the battlefield, and we will win, win, win."
00:20:52 - 00:21:30 (38 sec),"Weâre now set up to win, win, win. When I came in, we had some big problems. You look at what weâve done on so many fronts. And we actually have better relationships. They respect our country more than theyâve ever respected it. Our country is respected again. The United States is respected again. To help meet our military needs, I am very proud to report that 400 new jobs are coming here to Lima, compared to just a few years ago, and weâre doubling the size of your workforce."
00:21:30 - 00:22:00 (30 sec),"We need to. Our investment will also support thousands of additional jobs across our nation to assemble these incredible Abrams tanks. The engines are from Alabama, transmissions are from Indiana, special armor from Idaho, and the 120-millimeter gun -- and the gun parts from upstate New York and from Pennsylvania."
00:22:00 - 00:22:46 (45 sec),"All great places. In Ohio alone, almost 200 suppliers churn out parts and materials that go into every tank that rolls off this factoryâs floor. Incredible. What you achieve here at this plant is truly remarkable. And equally remarkable is that they wanted to close it. No good. Every day you start with a powerful, heavy, but sometimes rust-covered, hollowed-out hull -- and with incredible skill and extraordinary care -- you restore its unmatched power, strength, and glory with all brand new equipment inside."
00:22:46 - 00:23:19 (33 sec),"The best in the world. The amazing restorations you accomplish every day are a perfect symbol for what we're doing with American manufacturing all across our nation. And we just came out -- another chart -- we just came out with numbers -- the Economic Report of the President: 3.1 percent GDP. The first time in 14 years that we cracked 3, right?"
00:23:19 - 00:23:43 (24 sec),"That's pretty good -- 3.1. The press tried to make it 2.9. I said, ""It's not 2.9."" What they did is they took odd months. I said, ""No, no, no. You go from January to December. You don't take certain months and add them up."" Because I said, ""We're going to break 3."" And we did. We did 3.1. The fake news tried to change it but we caught them."
00:23:43 - 00:24:15 (32 sec),"[Laughter] I said -- I said, ""You know, we didn't break the 3. Oh, that's terrible."" They said, ""Yes, sir, you did. They just took odd months."" I said, ""No, no, January to December."" 3.1 percent, first time in 14 years. Congratulations. Sort of incredible. It's true. This chart is a beauty. This is ""Venture Capital Deals Surged Following the Passage of"" -- really, the election -- rising nearly $17 billion."
00:24:15 - 00:24:49 (34 sec),"You know what that means. So here's your charts -- going along -- and here's us. See the red line there? It's like a rocket ship. Can you see that? It's small but cheap -- [Laughter] -- and it gets the point across, right? A couple of other things -- because I think this report is incredible. So these are ""Workers Coming Off the Sidelines,"" and now it's just -- this is just partially."
00:24:49 - 00:25:11 (22 sec),"So, the blue. The blue. The red. That's a big difference. That's a tremendous difference. The most in many, many years. And everyone said, ""You couldn't do it, couldn't bring back manufacturing jobs."" Remember? ""You'd need a magic wand."" We're bringing them back beyond anybody's expectations. You see the red line here?"
00:25:11 - 00:25:42 (30 sec),"These are ""Wages are Rising for the Workers."" These are ""Wages are Rising."" 3.4 percent -- it's one of the largest increases in 20 years. And for the most part, they were going down. They weren't even rising. I used to campaign -- I'd be in Ohio, I'd be in Pennsylvania, I'd be all over, and I'd talk about wages where people would have to work three jobs and they were making less than they did 20 years ago."
00:25:42 - 00:26:04 (22 sec),"You remember that, Rob? Jim? I used to do it all the time. I'd be -- it was just a part of my speech. I'd say, ""You're working three jobs. You make less money than you did 20 years ago."" And it was literally 21 years. And now wages are going up. And you have something else that's happening. If you don't like working here -- and you all do -- and I don't want to lose anybody."
00:26:04 - 00:26:23 (20 sec),"And who the hell would want to leave this place? This is what you call a great -- a great place to work. But if for any reason -- if for any reason you did, you can pick out six, seven, eight other jobs. In other words, you can finally have a job that you really like, where you like getting up in the morning."
00:26:23 - 00:26:47 (24 sec),"I do. I do, even though I have the fake news hounding me all the time. The fake and phony and corrupt. It's fake. It's corrupt. But we got to live with it, right? Got to live with it. But you guys -- you do; you get up in the morning, you love to come, and you love your job, or you wouldn't be doing what I just witnessed back there when I looked at some of these incredible tanks."
00:26:47 - 00:27:09 (21 sec),"And here's another chart: ""Deregulating and Saving"" -- through the roof. Here's a chart: ""The American Energy."" The United States is the largest producer -- that's happened over the last short period of time -- of crude oil and natural gas in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. We're also a net -- do you think Russia is happy about this?"
00:27:09 - 00:27:35 (26 sec),"I don't think so. You know, Hillary wanted to put windmills all over the place. Let's put up some windmills. ""When the wind doesn't blow, just turn off the television, darling, please."" [Laughter] ""No wind out today. There's no wind. Please turn off the television, quickly."" [Laughter] Put the windmills up and watch the value of your house -- if you're in sight of a windmill, watch the value of your house go down by 65 percent."
00:27:35 - 00:28:01 (26 sec),"Wonderful to have windmills. And solar is wonderful too, but it's not strong enough and it's very, very expensive. So the United States is now the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Happened all in that very short -- you know, you guys are all so -- think of that. Think of that, beating out Saudi Arabia and Russia."
00:28:01 - 00:28:25 (24 sec),"They're pretty good producers, right? Guess what? We do more than they do. And in a short period of time, as soon as we get some pipelines opened in Texas, we'll be able to almost double it. Double it. What we're doing is incredible. We approved the Keystone Pipeline. Right? I did that. Forty-eight thousand jobs between that and the Dakota Access Pipeline."
00:28:25 - 00:28:46 (21 sec),"I got them approved, like almost my first couple of days in office. I said, ""They're approved."" And what is it? It's good environmentally. It's underground. You're not riding it over tracks. You're not trucking it. It's actually a great thing, environmentally. But President Obama, after years and years and years, they said, ""We're not going to approve it."" I said, ""We'll approve it."" Forty-eight thousand jobs."
00:28:46 - 00:29:06 (20 sec),"Think of it. It's being built right now. They're both being built. One just got completed -- Dakota Access. And many, many other cases like that. Plants all over the country are going up. But the thing that's the greatest is companies that left us -- they no longer wanted to be in the USA -- they're coming roaring back."
00:29:06 - 00:29:30 (24 sec),"Toyota -- $13.5 billion. We've created more than almost 6 million jobs since the election. And if I would have said that to the fake news during the campaign, they would've said, ""He exaggerates."" I'm not exaggerating, but nobody would've believed that could happen. Including almost 600,000 manufacturing jobs."
00:29:30 - 00:29:58 (28 sec),"We could've taken your jobs, all. If it werenât for me, this place would've been closed. Would have been closed. Would have been closed, fellas. And you're doing us a favor because of the great job you do. It's not just a one-way street. You're doing us a favor. Last year, our manufacturers reported the highest level of optimism ever recorded in a 40-year-old poll."
00:29:58 - 00:30:36 (37 sec),"And this year we went up again. Went from 56 percent -- and it stayed there for years, between 50 and 56 -- to 94 percent. They've never had anything like it. Thatâs optimism. And we -- all of us -- are living by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. Very simple. Unemployment has recently reached the lowest rate in 51 years."
00:30:36 - 00:31:02 (27 sec),"Other than that, we're not doing well. [Laughter] More -- and think of this: More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million people. More than ever before, by far. And if you look at African American -- you've heard me say this many times -- African American employment is at an all-time low -- unemployment."
00:31:02 - 00:31:32 (30 sec),"Asian American unemployment is at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment -- an all-time low. Women's unemployment -- 65-year low. Soon it'll be historic, meaning better than ever. And soon the basic number will be historic. We've reduced the number of unemployed veterans by nearly 50 percent. I'm so proud of that."
00:31:32 - 00:32:01 (29 sec),"Thatâs why the veterans like me more than other people. That's why they like me. Fifty percent since the election. And veteran unemployment is now at the lowest level ever, ever, ever recorded. Thanks to our pro-American tax, regulatory, and trade policies -- and, by the way, we're doing great in our deal with China."
00:32:01 - 00:32:28 (26 sec),"They were taking out 500 billion a year for many years from our country. I consider that we've rebuilt China. Five hundred billion, not million. Think of what that means. Five-hundred billion dollars a year taken out of our country. And now they're paying us. They're paying tariffs on the products they're sending in, and we're negotiating and they want to make a deal."
00:32:28 - 00:32:50 (22 sec),"And hopefully, we'll make a deal. And if we don't, thatâs fine. And if we do, thatâs fine. It's got to be a good deal. It can't be a bad deal. We're so far down, it's got to be a great deal. If itâs not a great deal, we'll never catch up. And their economy is way down. And I donât want their economy to be down; I want their economy to be up. But their economy is down 32 to 38 percent."
00:32:50 - 00:33:11 (22 sec),"And our economy, if you look at the numbers, since my election, is up almost 50 percent. Fifty. Thatâs some difference. And the world economy -- the world economy is not good. And frankly, if the world economy were good, that would be, in a way, good for us. So we're fighting there. We're bucking."
00:33:11 - 00:33:36 (25 sec),"Europe is down, Asia is down -- a lot of places. Almost every place is down. Except the United States is up. And we're way up. And just think of what that would be. The world goes up; we go up with the world. The world is down, but we still go up. Something is happening. That wouldnât happen under Barack Obama, that I can tell you."
00:33:36 - 00:34:19 (43 sec),"It wouldnât happen under Crooked Hillary Clinton. [Laughter] Last week, as I said, Toyota announced a massive investment. They're going to be expanding factories all across our nation. And they're going to be soon building new ones. Ford is bringing hundreds of new jobs to Chicago and other places. Tremendous amount of car companies are coming into the great state of Michigan, and they're coming into the great state of Ohio."
00:34:19 - 00:35:10 (50 sec),"Volkswagen is creating 1,000 brand new jobs in the state of Tennessee. And Chrysler is building Detroitâs first new car factory in a generation -- so long ago -- in a generation. Think of that. Michigan. Michigan. You know, the nice part about running for President this time, as opposed to last time -- last time, you know, I said I was going to do it, but I didnât do it. But I said I was going to do it. This time, I've done it far greater than I said I was going to do it. So it's going to be really easy on the debate stage when they hit me with nonsense and I say, ""Really?"
00:35:10 - 00:35:45 (35 sec),"But African American unemployment -- the best it's ever been."" Hispanic, Asian, women, everybody -- itâs all the best itâs ever been. How do you top that in a debate? What are they going to say? ""Uh, well, it could be better""? [Laughter] No, the easy part -- and I say this to all of your political leaders here -- if you do a good job, it's a lot easier that second time."
00:35:45 - 00:35:57 (12 sec),"But nobody has done the job that we've done. And I say ""we"" because you've been on our side. Your union leaders aren't on my side, by the way. I watched them on television. They're not. But the unions -- the people that work there are on our side. It's true. It's true. I had -- [Audience chants Trump]"
00:35:57 - 00:36:18 (21 sec),"I had union leaders in the White House a few months ago -- the biggest guys. Nice guys, but they're Democrats no matter what. Okay? And you see where that's taken you. That would've been catastrophic. But I had them in, and we explained how good it was for the car industry, for this, for that. They said, ""Oh, thank you, sir."
00:36:18 - 00:36:46 (28 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this is unbelievable. Thank you, sir."" But then I see one of the guys the next day on a television show. The -- I think it was called ""Deface the Nation."" [Laughter] And -- ladies and gentlemen, ""Deface the Nation."" And he's saying how he's a Democrat and he wants Democrat policies -- which were, by the way, putting everybody in the poorhouse."
00:36:46 - 00:37:16 (30 sec),"But I just left the guy. He's hugging me, kissing me, telling him what an unbelievable deal. Nobody else could do it. And the next day, he's on there talking about stuff. And I really said, ""I sort of don't want to meet these guys. I want to deal with the people in the union, not the heads of the union."" Because the heads of the union are not honest people."
00:37:16 - 00:37:48 (31 sec),"They're not honest, and they ought to lower your dues, by the way. They ought to stop with the dues. They -- you're paying too much dues. As an example, they could've kept General Motors. They could've kept it in that gorgeous plant at Lordstown. They could've kept it. Lower your dues. Lower your dues."
00:37:48 - 00:38:17 (30 sec),"Americaâs Founders understood that to be strong and powerful as a nation, we must also be a great manufacturing nation. President Obama said, ""You'll never bring manufacturing back."" I said, ""What are you talking about?"" It's all about manufacturing. And we're bringing it back in record numbers. Nobody can believe it. And these are talented jobs."
00:38:17 - 00:39:00 (43 sec),"These are great jobs. These are genius jobs. And these are really well-paying jobs, as you people know. You get a lot of money. Letâs negotiate. [Laughter] We must not be dependent upon others for the resources we need to protect our people. When we open this plant, a couple of my people -- I have some good business people -- they said, ""Let's make a deal with the workers before we open it. We'll make a great deal."" I said, ""I agree we can do that, but we're not going to do that."
00:39:00 - 00:39:17 (17 sec),"These people have suffered enough."" We're going to open the plant and everybody is going to be happy. You understand what I mean by that. That's why my administration is restoring Americaâs defense industrial base by bringing great jobs and great wages to plants just like this in Lima. Economy and strength is security."
00:39:17 - 00:39:40 (23 sec),"And it's all about security and national security. It's about loving our country. It's about loving our flag. You know that. Now, as result of my very tough trade actions -- something I'm very proud of -- America's steel and our steel mills are roaring back to life. You know that. You see it all over."
00:39:40 - 00:40:10 (31 sec),"We put a big, fat beautiful tariff on that dumped steel. It's sand steel. It's mud steel. It's crap steel. And they're dumping it all over. I said, ""That's okay, you can dump but we're going to charge you 25 percent when you come in and think you're going to take our jobs and give us bad steel."" I know a lot about -- I've used a lot of steel."
00:40:10 - 00:40:34 (24 sec),"Right here in Ohio, Nucor has just announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a brand new, 150-million-dollar steel plant in Cuyahoga Heights. JSW Steel is restarting the furnace -- that's a massive furnace -- and investing $500 million in Mingo Junction."
00:40:34 - 00:41:03 (29 sec),"And Cleveland Cliffs announced a brand new, 700-million-dollar plant in Toledo, Ohio. Don't leave here, though. Donât leave here. Don't get any ideas. Don't get leave here. Just stay here. Just relax. Stay here. We don't want you going to Mingo Junction. We're also finally fixing the horrible trade deals that have cost our nation trillions of dollars and where we've lost millions and millions and millions of jobs, like we were stupid people."
00:41:03 - 00:41:28 (25 sec),"They closed a plant; they move it to Mexico. They make the product; they sell it right in the United States. No tax. All we end up with is loss and no jobs. We get no taxes. We get nothing. That doesn't happen anymore. Under our new deal, there's a tremendous financial disincentive to close up plants and move them to other countries."
00:41:28 - 00:41:43 (15 sec),"You're not going to see that anymore. And we're getting rid of the disaster known as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated in the history of the world. All over the country, you still see empty plants, when they haven't been converted to nursing homes and apartments, right?"
00:41:43 - 00:42:10 (27 sec),"It's not the same thing as a plant. I love apartments. I love the business. But that's not the same thing as a plant where you have 5,000 people working. Not the same thing. And replacing it -- we're replacing NAFTA with the great U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Like the song. If you can't remember -- YMCA, right?"
00:42:10 - 00:42:31 (20 sec),"We'll play the song for you, everybody. USMCA. We've taken historic action to confront Chinaâs trading abuses, because the days of stealing American jobs and our ideas and our wealth have come to an end, folks. They've come to an idea, all right? They've come to an end. We've made some progress."
00:42:31 - 00:42:57 (26 sec),"That's why you see these numbers. Look at that chart. Look at that. You don't have to know what's on it. What difference -- look at the line. [Laughter] You don't have to know what the hell is on it. All you know is thatâs a good line. [Laughter] Technological positive change. That's okay, right? It's all like that."
00:42:57 - 00:43:42 (45 sec),"That's what it is. Rob, Jim, that's what it is. Turner, see that? Look. That's what we fight for, right? Huh? That's what we're all fighting for. In everything we do and every action we take, we're putting America first, and we are putting American workers first, for the first time in a long time. So just in closing, I'd like to now introduce a couple of truly incredible workers from right here -- I guess you know these folks -- right here at the tank plant to share quickly their stories with you."
00:43:42 - 00:44:05 (23 sec),"Adam Stahler is a Quality Engineer who has worked at the plant for 10 years. His son, Derek, is a Specialist with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas. Great Place. Derek operates and maintains Stryker personnel carriers, one of the vehicles produced right here in Lima. Adam, thank you for everything your family has done for our nation."
00:44:05 - 00:44:07 (2 sec),"Please come up and say a few words. Adam, thank you."
00:44:07 - 00:44:55 (49 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. It's a pleasure and an honor to be up here today as a representative of the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center. For those of you who don't me, my name is Adam Stahler. I'm a Quality Systems Engineer employed here going on 10 years. Growing up in the area and currently living in Wapakoneta, I have witnessed the highs and lows the economy has had on this facility and the region."
00:44:55 - 00:45:10 (15 sec),"I'm proud that this administration recognizes the importance of this facility and the value we provide to the warfighter. It is very rewarding to have a son serving the United States military, where he is stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, working on a quality vehicle produced by my brothers and sisters at JSMC."
00:45:10 - 00:45:11 (1 sec),My son thanks you.
00:45:11 - 00:45:13 (1 sec),"And for that, I thank you."
00:45:13 - 00:45:23 (10 sec),"Boy, you're a young guy. How old are you?"
00:45:23 - 00:45:24 (1 sec),Forty-five.
00:45:24 - 00:45:27 (3 sec),Wow. You look like your son.
00:45:27 - 00:45:28 (1 sec),"Oh, thank you."
00:45:28 - 00:45:54 (26 sec),"Thank you. I thought Adam was the son. Look how young he looks. [Laughter] He's got a son working out there? Wow. Whatever you're eating, Adam, keep eating it. [Laughter] It's working. Jay Baldwin is a Boiler Operator and a proud Army veteran. After serving as a tank crewman on the M1, now Jay helps build the M1 right here."
00:45:54 - 00:45:57 (3 sec),"You know him. Jay, please come on up."
00:45:57 - 00:46:12 (16 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President, for coming to our plant in Lima, Ohio. As a former Army M1 tanker, I can honestly say that we make the best tank in the entire world. Our workers here are very proud to be making such a fine product for our soldiers to have the benefit and best capabilities on the battlefield."
00:46:12 - 00:46:37 (24 sec),"And thanks to our great President, his military and economic policies have rejuvenated this facility to increase production of armored vehicles and hiring of more skilled workers. And finally, it is my personal opinion that God was looking after our country when you were elected. Mr. President, thank you for everything you have done."
00:46:37 - 00:46:44 (8 sec),"Thank you, truthfully."
00:46:44 - 00:47:08 (24 sec),"Wow. Thank you. Thank you. That's so nice, Jay and Adam. I appreciate it. You never know what you get when you come up. It's live. [Laughter] But you couldnât do better than that, right? Thatâs great. Thank you, fellas. Thatâs great. I want to also thank all of the patriots here today. You remind us that the might of Americaâs armed forces also depends upon the skill and devotion of all of America's workers."
00:47:08 - 00:47:39 (31 sec),"And you really are doing a job. Weâre very proud of you. For nearly 80 years, the exceptional workers at this plant has embodied the strength of the American spirit. Those who choose to work here are drawn not just by the promise of a good paycheck but by the power of patriotism -- every single one of you is a patriot -- the chance to go to work every morning to help protect this nation that we so deeply love."
00:47:39 - 00:48:15 (36 sec),"Thatâs why veterans make up more than one third of the workforce at this wonderful plant. We very much stress: We want, wherever we can, we want veterans. Thatâs why you check -- right? Thatâs right. And thatâs why you check and recheck every bolt, every single thing having to do with that incredible tank -- every pin, every wire, every square inch of each tank before it leaves the floor."
00:48:15 - 00:48:39 (24 sec),"And I just got a little news that was given to me as I was walking up. U.S. forces, in the last month, have killed the terrorists responsible for the attack in Syria that killed four Americans, the Paris theater attack in 2015, and the USS Cole bombing in 2000. We killed them all. We killed them all."
00:48:39 - 00:49:33 (54 sec),"We killed them all. We killed them all. Theyâre bad people. But thatâs why you show up early and you stay late, and always get the job done right. Youâre proud of your work. You do it better than anyone, anywhere in the world -- what you do. No country on Earth can match you and no country can match what you do. In just a few months, we will commemorate the 75th anniversary of one of the many victories that workers at the Lima Army Tank Plant helped make possible: the Normandy landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944, in the Second World War."
00:49:33 - 00:49:47 (14 sec),It was right here on these very grounds that thousands of American workers modified M4 Sherman tanks in preparation for a battle that would forever change the course of human history.
00:49:47 - 00:50:18 (32 sec),Right here. The workers who rallied to the Lima plant came from all over northwest Ohio and beyond. They were farmers and refinery workers and shopkeepers and homemakers who rolled up their sleeves and got to work when their country needed them the most. Normandy. Many of them had full-time jobs elsewhere.
00:50:18 - 00:50:47 (29 sec),"They punched out at one job, then came here and punched right back in. Not for the money. They knew and fully understood the importance of what they did and what they represented. And if they were lucky, they might catch a few hoursâ sleep on the loading dock before doing it all again, day after day, day after day."
00:50:47 - 00:51:20 (32 sec),"In just three years, the patriots of Ohio cranked out more than 100,000 military vehicles -- a truly amazing feat that helped give America the power to vanquish tyranny, defeat our enemies, and save freedom for the entire world. This is the legacy that each of you inherits. And America knows you will carry it forward with the same purpose and passion that you've poured into this factory each and every day."
00:51:20 - 00:51:57 (37 sec),"We love you. We see your legacy in every battlefield victory, in the smiling faces of every soldier that returns home safely, and every time a citizen proudly salutes our great American flag. Because it is here in Lima -- right here -- that American greatness is forged with American hands, with American heart, and with American pride."
00:51:57 - 00:52:30 (32 sec),"True. True. We donât know what challenges will come, what dangers we must face, or what opportunities we must seize. But we know that America will always be ready because of you and your strength, and your skill and your drive, and your unbreakable spirit. Because of hardworking citizens like you, the people of Lima, the people of Ohio, and the people of America will always fight on to victory, victory, victory."
00:52:30 - 00:53:08 (38 sec),"You donât know how to lose. You never will have to find out. Youâll never have to find out about losing. Together, we shall forever be one nation, under God. So I want to thank you. I want to say God bless you, God bless Ohio, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody.Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:38 (38 sec),"Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you very much also to a man named Matt Schlapp. What a job he's done. And to CPAC -- I actually started quite a while ago at CPAC, and came here -- probably made my first real political speech. And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third."
00:00:38 - 00:01:16 (38 sec),"Then I said, what the hell, let's run for President. Right? But it's wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives. What a future you have. Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited. What we've done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world."
00:01:16 - 00:01:55 (40 sec),"They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities. They came from all over. And what we did in 2016 -- the Election, we call it, with a capital ""E"" -- it's never been done before. And we're going to do it, I think, again in 2020, and the numbers are going to be even bigger. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:01:55 - 00:02:20 (24 sec),"And we all had to endure, as I was running. So you had 17 Republicans, plus me. [Laughter] And I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican. People just didnât quite understand that. They didnât understand it. I think now, with what we've done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well."
00:02:20 - 00:02:48 (29 sec),"And it's driving the other side crazy. But we all had to endure, remember? How many times did you hear, for months and months, ""There is no way to 270""? You know what that means, right? ""There is no way to 270."" They couldnât get me there. We might as well have just given up. But there wasnât any way to 270. In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one."
00:02:48 - 00:03:36 (48 sec),"But we didnât need the one. We didnât need it. We won Maine. We won our half of Maine, remember? You have Nebraska. We won both in Nebraska. We won the half we had to win in Maine. So we got the one, but we didnât need the one, because we didnât get 270; we got 306 to 223. 223-306. A state called Wisconsin, a state called -- Michigan, where -- by the way, where Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion incredible -- expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce."
00:03:36 - 00:04:12 (36 sec),"Many, many car companies have moved back to Michigan and are continuing to do so. Big numbers. Nobody every thought they'd see that happen. So I think we're going to do even better in 2020. I think we're going to do numbers that people havenât seen for a long time. The men and women here today are on the frontlines of protecting Americaâs interests, defending Americaâs value, and reclaiming our nationâs priceless heritage."
00:04:12 - 00:05:07 (55 sec),"It's true. With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals. These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for. It's been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense. It wasnât ""America first."" In many cases, it was ""America last."" Those days are over."
00:05:07 - 00:05:43 (36 sec),"Long over. America is winning again. America is respected again. And the world knows it. When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents -- and I get along with them -- because they know that what's taken place over many years -- not just the Obama administration; long before that -- they can't believe, themselves, that they got away with it. They can't believe it. An impossible thing."
00:05:43 - 00:06:14 (31 sec),"And they like me. And the reason they like me -- they tell me; they say, ""Mr. President..."" I said -- as an example, President Xi of China, I have great respect. We have a great relationship. I say, ""How is it possible that you got away with this for so long?"" [Laughter] And he said, ""Because nobody ever asked us to change."" It's true."
00:06:14 - 00:06:43 (30 sec),"When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent and then to 40 percent -- and they said to me, ""We expected that somebody would call and say you can't do that."" [Laughter] ""Nobody called, so we just left it."" And I donât blame them."
00:06:43 - 00:07:16 (33 sec),We shouldâve been doing the same thing to them. But we didnât. True. Right? Hard to believe. It's hard to believe. But now things are different. Now we're negotiating with China. They wouldnât negotiate with previous administrations. But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich -- really rich.
00:07:16 - 00:08:07 (51 sec),"The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty. But, fortunately, they werenât terminated. We started getting politically correct, even back then. But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws? And I checked, and I found 301 and 382. I found one, 1938, where we can do what we have to do. But, you know, they had a debate in -- it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we didnât know what the hell to do with it. Tough, tough, tough."
00:08:07 - 00:08:29 (22 sec),"It was called the Great Tariff Debate. Mark Levin will look this up. [Laughter] And the problem is, with Mark, if I make a little mistake, he'll let us know on Sunday night. [Laughter] I got to be very careful when I talk about this. But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888. And the debate was: We didnât know what to do with all of the money we were making."
00:08:29 - 00:08:44 (16 sec),"We were so rich. And McKinley, prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country. And he made statements that, ""Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country. We can't do that. We can't ever allow that to happen."" And, you know -- I don't know, maybe you know."
00:08:44 - 00:08:45 (1 sec),"You know I'm totally off-script, right? [Audience member calls out]"
00:08:45 - 00:09:02 (16 sec),"Thank you, darling. [Laughter] You know I'm totally off script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off script. True. And if we donât go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks. Because we have to get it back. And when I look at what's happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, ""No, no..."" -- I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it -- [Audience Boos] [Audience Boos]"
00:09:02 - 00:09:43 (41 sec),"The Green New Deal, right? Green New Deal -- I encourage it. I think it's really something that they should promote. [Laughter] They should work hard on. It's something our country needs desperately. They have to go out and get it. But I'll take the other side of that argument only because I'm mandated to. I'm mandated."
00:09:43 - 00:09:59 (16 sec),"But they should stay with that argument. Never change. [Laughter] Never change. No planes. No energy. [Laughter] When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric. [Laughter] Let's hurry up. ""Darling"" -- ""Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling."" [Laughter] No, but it's true."
00:09:59 - 00:10:46 (47 sec),"So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 -- and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted. We built forces up that were incredible. Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay? They ended tariffs. Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs. They said, ""Oh, it's okay for other nations to come in."" I won't use a certain words because it's not politically -- but everybody knows the word I'd love to use."
00:10:46 - 00:11:13 (27 sec),"Should I use it? I won't do it. Our great First Lady always said, ""Don't use certain words, please."" I said, ""But the audience wanted me to do it."" She said, ""Don't do it."" And the problem is, if I do do that, they won't put the little preamble that we just went through. They'll just use the word, and they'll said, ""Isn't that terrible."" So I won't use it. [Laughter] I've learned."
00:11:13 - 00:11:14 (2 sec),Because with the fake news -- [Audience Boos]
00:11:14 - 00:11:59 (45 sec),"-- if you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, ""Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please."" ""Please get us the emails. Please!"" [Audience chants Trump]"
00:11:59 - 00:12:19 (19 sec),"So everybody is having a good time. I'm laughing, we're all having fun. And then that fake CNN and others say, ""He asked Russia to go get the emails. Horrible."" [Laughter] I mean, I thought -- like, two weeks ago, I'm watching and they're talking about one of the points. ""He asked Russia for the emails."" These people are sick."
00:12:19 - 00:12:49 (30 sec),"[Laughter] And I'm telling you, they know the game. They know the game, and they play it dirty -- dirtier than anybody has ever played the game. Dirtier than it's ever been played. But the thing that we've done is very special. Because, on trade, and because of tariffs -- and I know there are people in the Republican Party and people -- really, even conservatives -- good conservatives -- they donât like tariffs."
00:12:49 - 00:13:14 (26 sec),"I'm not liking or not liking. The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country. Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over? Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods. I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion."
00:13:14 - 00:13:59 (45 sec),"Not like $200 million -- that's a lot. This is 200 with a ""B"" -- billion. Two-hundred billion. So -- but I was nice, because we're having a very strong negotiation, which if it werenât for tariffs -- and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide. I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position."
00:13:59 - 00:14:22 (23 sec),"But in my case, it can't, because it's true. I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion. And here's the beauty: We've lost so much money with China -- $500 billion a year. And on trade, it's such a disaster; it's $507 billion a year. China -- just one country. We lose with everybody, almost."
00:14:22 - 00:14:54 (32 sec),"But China is one country. $507 billion, for many years. So the beauty is this: I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on. The numbers are staggering. Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury. And for those of you that havenât done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country -- as it's turned out, because it's now been on there for a long while."
00:14:54 - 00:15:24 (29 sec),"Our -- and I'm in no rush because I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it. Of the 25 points, we've paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points. Okay? Twenty-one. Thatâs what the numbers are. It's very simple. You know, everyone said, ""Oh, it's a tax on our..."" It's not really. And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it. So the tax really is incredible."
00:15:24 - 00:15:38 (14 sec),"But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate. But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not Mark Meadows. Where is the great Mark Meadows? He's here someplace. Man, has he been good. Mark and Jim Jordan, and -- I want to name every one of those couple of hundred people."
00:15:38 - 00:15:57 (19 sec),"Because we do have a lot. I want to name every damn one of them. They have been incredible. They've been fighting. And I just see Mark in the audience. They've been fighting -- with Deb, much more important. His wife is incredible. What an asset. He would be nowhere without her. [Laughter] Right?"
00:15:57 - 00:16:20 (22 sec),"But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it's dying. So they donât have anything with Russia. There's no collusion. So now they go and morph into, ""Let's inspect every deal he's ever done. We're going to go into his finances."
00:16:20 - 00:16:39 (19 sec),"We're going to check his deals. We're going to check..."" These people are sick. [Laughter] They're sick. I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday. No, it's the first time. He went into a meeting and he said, ""We're going to look into his finances."" I said, ""Where did that come from?"" He always talked about Russia -- collusion with Russia."
00:16:39 - 00:16:55 (17 sec),"The collusion delusion. [Laughter] So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out whether or not, and who we're dealing with. We're waiting for a report by people that werenât elected. We had -- think of this: We had the greatest election -- in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson."
00:16:55 - 00:17:25 (30 sec),"This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I'm not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater. You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan, when I first started. ""This is Ronald Reagan."" Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote."
00:17:25 - 00:17:50 (26 sec),"Those red hats -- and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. ""Make America Great Again,"" is what it says. Right? Right? But we had the greatest of all time. Now we have people that lost. And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there."
00:17:50 - 00:18:15 (24 sec),"And, all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit. Okay? [Laughter] With bullshit. Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the Attorney General says, ""I'm going to recuse myself."" [Laughter] ""I'm going to recuse."" And I said, why the hell didnât he tell me that before I put him in? How do you recuse yourself?"
00:18:15 - 00:18:49 (35 sec),"But the person that appointed Robert Mueller never received a vote. Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission. [Laughter] Now, how do you do that? These are angry, angry people. You take a look at them. One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen."
00:18:49 - 00:19:10 (21 sec),"[Laughter] All killers. In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put half and half, and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he'll probably do. But we have conflicts. I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why isnât that mentioned?"
00:19:10 - 00:19:27 (17 sec),"He wanted the job as FBI Director. I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it. Why isnât that -- and I didnât give it to him. Why isnât that mentioned? Jim Comey -- Lyin' James Comey -- [Audience Boos]"
00:19:27 - 00:20:11 (44 sec),"-- is his best friend. James Comey is his best friend. And those are a few of the conflicts. Other than that, it's wonderful. [Laughter] So -- so everybody is waiting. I thought of it this morning, Mark. And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement today. Mark Levin. I heard it was incredible."
00:20:11 - 00:20:38 (27 sec),"And I was on the way. But I'll see it later. I guarantee I'll be watching it later. I have one of the great inventions in history. It's called TiVo. [Laughter] I think it's actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right? [Laughter] But I'll be watching it later, Mark."
00:20:38 - 00:21:03 (25 sec),"But people that got no votes. But I heard this morning, ""President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report."" I said, wait a minute, let me get this straight. [Laughter] So the Attorney General recuses himself, and I donât fire him. No obstruction. That's the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it's called obstruction."
00:21:03 - 00:21:31 (28 sec),"But only for Trump. For nobody else. [Laughter] So the Attorney General is weak and ineffective, and he doesnât do what he should've done. Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter -- horrible -- about Comey. Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired, or worse, if possible. [Laughter] Every Republican said -- everybody -- in fact, when I fired Comey, I said, ""You know..."" -- First Lady -- I said, ""Melania, I'm doing something today."
00:21:31 - 00:21:59 (29 sec),"I'm doing it because it really has to be done."" He's bad. He's a bad, bad -- he's a bad, bad guy. That's been proven now with all of the emails and the texts. ""I'm doing something that has to be done. But you know the good news? It's going to be bipartisan. It's going to be so popular, it's going to be bipartisan."" [Laughter] Every Democrat hates him."
00:21:59 - 00:22:30 (30 sec),"Every Republican hates him. He did a horrible job at the FBI. Speak to the real agents, the real people. Because the people in the FBI are incredible people -- not the sleaze on top. And I said to the First Lady -- I said, ""But you know the good news? The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan."
00:22:30 - 00:22:56 (27 sec),"Everyone is going to love it."" So we fire Comey. And Schumer -- who called for his resignation many times -- Podesta, I believe that day -- because he still hasnât gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay? I believe that day called for his resignation. That day. Podesta, the great genius of campaigns."
00:22:56 - 00:23:27 (31 sec),"[Laughter] He called for the Comey resignation. Others -- almost every, I would say. Mark, would you say virtually every Democrat, virtually every -- I can't think of anybody that said he's doing a good job. So I said to Melania, ""Melania, the good news, this will be a popular thing."" [Laughter] And I fire a bad cop."
00:23:27 - 00:23:54 (27 sec),"I fire a dirty cop. And all of a sudden, the Democrats say, ""How dare he fire him. How dare he do this."" And that's where we are, folks. That's where we are. We're in this swamp of Washington, D.C. But you know what? We're winning, and they're not. We're winning. So, just to finish -- and I'll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this."
00:23:54 - 00:24:18 (23 sec),"[Laughter] He's saying, ""This is a lot more than we paid for."" You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, ""Bye, folks."" But you know what I like about this? Number one, I'm in love, and you're in love. We're all in love together. We've done something that nobody has ever done. Right?"
00:24:18 - 00:24:40 (22 sec),"It's easy. No, it's easy. You know, a great friend of mine from New York, he's a stone-cold killer. He's a brutal man. He's actually not even a good friend of mine because he'd turn on me in two seconds if it was [Inaudible]. [Laughter] But he's a very rich guy. And he said, ""What are you going to speak about today?"
00:24:40 - 00:25:08 (27 sec),"Like, what are you going to speak?"" I said, ""I don't know. I don't know."" [Laughter] He said, ""I just heard that you have the biggest crowd in the history of CPAC. They're all over. By the way, not only in this giant room. They're in many hotel rooms all over the place. You're just better at real estate than they are."" [Laughter] True."
00:25:08 - 00:25:54 (46 sec),"But this guy -- you all know his name -- very rich guy. And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking. If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes. [Laughter] He can't breathe. You know, juh-juh. ""Are you okay?"" He kills people for a living -- meaning mentally and financially -- but if there's like an audience of nine, it's like ""augh."" [Laughter] So he said to me, ""How the hell do you do that?"" And I said, ""It's easy."" And the reason it's easy -- I really mean this -- there's so much love in this room, it's easy to talk."
00:25:54 - 00:26:28 (34 sec),You can talk your heart out. You really could. There's love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. And we've had that from the day I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in Trump Tower. It's been easy. And you know what? We never had an empty seat.
00:26:28 - 00:26:59 (31 sec),"We went out and helped Ted Cruz. We went out and helped so many people. And I'll tell you what: If we didnât do those 32 rallies -- and it wasnât easy. When you're doing rallies with 25-, 30,000 people -- in Texas, we had 109,000 people sign up. We used the Houston Rockets arena; it holds 22,000. Tens of thousands were outside."
00:26:59 - 00:27:34 (35 sec),"We were sending notices, ""Please donât come."" That's a little different. Usually, people are begging. ""Well, yeah, like can somebody come?"" [Laughter] We never had an empty seat. Of course, the Washington Post -- a guy named David Weigel -- he wrote an article, some arena -- [Audience Boos]"
00:27:34 - 00:28:30 (56 sec),"No, listen to this. He wrote an article. He got there four hours early. He took pictures of an empty arena. He then put out a note -- something to the effect, ""Not very good crowd size, Mr. President."" And I never saw it because I donât follow the guy. But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that couldnât get in -- he got there four or five hours early because he doesnât fly private."
00:28:30 - 00:28:49 (19 sec),"You know. [Laughter] And maybe it's because of the carbon footprint. You think maybe that's it? [Laughter] Maybe. Must be the carbon footprint. He just doesnât want private. But he got there hours early. And, you know, the place hadnât started taking in people. They werenât going to take them in. So there were virtually nobody."
00:28:49 - 00:29:11 (22 sec),"And, you know, whatever it was -- 18,000 -- when you have nobody, it's a little scary-looking. So he took pictures. And you know who really got even? Our people. Because they were incensed. We had people sitting on the stairwells. We had people sitting in every seat. I donât think we've had an empty seat since we announced."
00:29:11 - 00:29:31 (19 sec),"And from the day we came down the escalator, I really donât believe we've had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium. It's been an incredible thing. And that's why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in 2020 with an even bigger victory. [Applause, Audience chants Four More Years]"
00:29:31 - 00:29:53 (22 sec),"And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great Sarah Huckabee and Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here -- Mercedes, thank you. They always say -- you know, they're good people, right? Much better than I am. They always say, ""Don't bring it up. Donât fight. Donât fight."
00:29:53 - 00:30:22 (29 sec),"Everyone understands."" I said, ""They donât understand."" If I donât explain it, how are they going to understand? So remember the arena one, right? And then it was shown. And the Washington Post had to do -- and this particular writer -- had to do a -- I thought he was going to get fired. I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot."
00:30:22 - 00:31:09 (47 sec),"He would've been humiliated for what he did. Because it was fake news. Nobody was in the arena. There were thousands outside but they hadnât opened the gates yet. They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean -- how horrible."
00:31:09 - 00:31:30 (21 sec),And I watched it by mistake. [Laughter] And they showed -- they showed from the White House all the way down. They showed from the Cap- -- they showed -- there were people. Nobody has ever seen it. The Capitol down to the Washington Monument -- people. But I saw pictures that there were no people. [Laughter] Those pictures were taken hours before.
00:31:30 - 00:32:02 (32 sec),"Right? And they always mention crowd size. ""He talks about crowd size."" So I'm constantly bugging Mercedes. Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, ""Mercedes"" -- and Sarah -- ""show them the pictures. Show them. And compare them with what they put on television. Those pictures were taken hours before."" And remember this also -- not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument."
00:32:02 - 00:32:27 (25 sec),"And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet. And women and men -- and I consider them totally equal, so I'm not going to say it's harder. [Laughter] In fact, it's probably, with the men I know, it's actually easier for the women to make the walk, right? [Audience Calls Out No]"
00:32:27 - 00:32:52 (25 sec),"But they had to walk all the way down. They had to walk with high heels, in many cases. They had to walk all the way down to the Washington Monument and then back. And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on -- I said to the people that were sitting next to me, ""I've never seen anything like this."
00:32:52 - 00:33:18 (26 sec),"Look at that crowd."" And it was wide. Wide. We had a crowd -- I've never seen anything like it. And I have to live -- I have to live with ""crowd size."" It's all a phony deal. But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken hours before our great day. That was a great day for us. That was a great, great day."
00:33:18 - 00:33:48 (30 sec),"People came from all over. People came from all over. So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, ""Sir, it doesnât matter. Nobody cares."" I said, ""But I care."" [Laughter] And people care. People care. So what I'm going to do is I'll give it to the great one. I'll give it to Mark Levin. And I'll give him the picture."
00:33:48 - 00:34:21 (34 sec),"Then I'll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field -- like nobody on it. And you'll see the sun. You know, you can see it's very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right? [Laughter] And you can have some fun. You're going to get big ratings on your show, I'll tell you that."
00:34:21 - 00:34:56 (34 sec),"Sunday night, everybody. Sunday night. Huh? Ten o'clock, right? Sunday night at 10 o'clock. [Audience Member Calls Out, Trump laughs] Thank you. I knew that, actually. But thank you. All right, now let's get back to what I'm here for. [Laughter] And don't fall asleep. Donât fall asleep, right? Donât fall asleep. You know, somebody said, ""Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible."" They said it was incredible."
00:34:56 - 00:35:30 (35 sec),"They said that was so great. And I said -- I said -- I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there. [Laughter] Of course, by the following morning, they had to change because the head people called up, ""What are you doing?"" [Laughter] A lot of it is not the people on television, you know."
00:35:30 - 00:35:51 (20 sec),"A lot of it is their bosses -- which someday we're going to have to figure out why, Meadows, why that is. Because, you know, if you're building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we've ever had. More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country."
00:35:51 - 00:36:19 (28 sec),"And you say, why are they upset by that? Why? Why are they upset by that? We've slashed 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record in the history of the United States, even by Presidents there for eight years, and in one case more. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history."
00:36:19 - 00:36:46 (28 sec),"And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal. Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare. It should. The great state of Texas has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate. Now that it's gone, I don't know how they rule against it. Now we'll have to find out."
00:36:46 - 00:37:14 (27 sec),"But that'll soon be up in the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope. And we're going to see what happens. And then we're going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay? Really great healthcare. And of the other things we did in our tax package is ANWR. Perhaps the largest field in the world -- oil and gas."
00:37:14 - 00:37:40 (26 sec),"I got it approved. And I didnât want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Donât get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I donât want to get it. Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he's in the oil business."
00:37:40 - 00:38:16 (36 sec),"He's not asking for anything. He said -- but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas. He said to me, ""Hey"" -- and they all call me ""Mr. President."" I have friends that, for 35 years, ""Hey, Don, how you doing? Hey, Donny. I love you, Donny."" For 35 years. Now they call, ""Mr. President, sir."" [Laughter] ""How are you?"" I have a friend -- a very rich guy -- Richard LeFrak, in New York."
00:38:16 - 00:38:45 (29 sec),"A builder. A good builder. He calls me all my life, ""Hey, Don, how you doing?"" I've known this guy so long -- from kindergarten. [Laughter] It's true. ""Hi, Don, how you doing? How's everything?"" And now I get a call the other day, ""Mr. President, how are you, sir? How are you?"" I said, ""Richard, lighten up. Lighten up."" [Laughter] ""Call me 'Donald'."" ""Richard, call me 'Donald'."" You've known me for -- I donât want to say, because I donât want my wife to hear the number."" [Laughter] But -- it's true."
00:38:45 - 00:39:18 (32 sec),"Actually, that's true. That's actually true. Richard came up; he said, ""I've known your husband for 65 years."" I said, ""Donât say that."" [Laughter] I say, ""Say 25, 30. Donât say 65 years."" But I said, ""Richard -- Richard, call me 'Donald', like you always do. Call me 'Don'."" ""Okay."" ""Okay, Don. Okay."" He gets his breath."
00:39:18 - 00:40:04 (46 sec),"Uh-huh. Two minutes later -- ""Mr. President..."" [Laughter] That's called respect for the office, right? Maybe that's a good thing, right? Many -- many of my friends. And that wasnât in the script either, Mark. [Laughter] But we're renegotiating, right now, horrible trade deals that we're cracking down -- and we are really doing a number -- cracking down on countries that cheat, and standing up for the American worker for the first time in many, many decades."
00:40:04 - 00:40:29 (25 sec),Many decades. Our workers have been treated horribly. A country announces they're closing their plant in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Ohio -- they're closing. They're closing a plant; they're going to move to Mexico. They're going to move to China. They're going to move someplace else. They fire all their workers.
00:40:29 - 00:40:58 (29 sec),"And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in Mexico, sell them back to here. No tax, no nothing. Those days are all gone, folks. They're all gone. They're all gone. And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it's very, very hard -- prohibitively hard -- for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location."
00:40:58 - 00:41:19 (21 sec),"It's now a very costly -- they can do it, I guess, if they want. But it's costly. It's painful. It used to be almost -- I said -- I used to -- I've been talking about this for a long time. I used to say it's almost like we're giving them an incentive to leave our country. Again, I'm for America first. That wasnât for America first."
00:41:19 - 00:41:35 (16 sec),"And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country. They're coming back in. They're coming back in. And, by the way, you know I'm building the wall. We're finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It's in the thing. [Audience chants Build that Wall]"
00:41:35 - 00:42:25 (50 sec),But -- and there will be some people in the room that donât like this. We're down to 3.7 percent unemployment -- the lowest number in a long time. But think of this: I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place.
00:42:25 - 00:42:40 (15 sec),"This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we've been. Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in. We need workers to come in, but they've got to come in legally, and they've got to come in through merit, merit, merit. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:42:40 - 00:43:09 (29 sec),"They've got to come in through merit. They have to be people that can help us. They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country. We have people in Congress -- right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country. [Audience Boos]"
00:43:09 - 00:43:33 (24 sec),"And you know that. And we can name every one of them if they want. They hate our country. It's sad. It's very sad. When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it's very, very sad. Very, very -- and find out, how did they do in their country? Just ask them, how did they do? Did they do well?"
00:43:33 - 00:44:09 (36 sec),"Were they succeeding? Just ask that question. Somebody would say, ""Oh, that's terrible that he brings that up."" But that's okay, I donât mind. I'll bring it up. [Laughter] How did they do in their country? Not so good. Not so good. But we need workers. We have to bring in workers. One other thing -- because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes."
00:44:09 - 00:44:32 (23 sec),"We have some senators. We have some congressmen. When a senator tells us that he's a free trader, so am I. I'm a fair trader. I'm a free trader. But when a senator said we can't do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we're able to use this tremendous power that I found -- tremendous -- old stuff."
00:44:32 - 00:45:00 (28 sec),"Nobody even knew it existed. I'm able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals. They wouldn't even be talking to us because it's so one-sided. Last year, we lost eight hundred -- this for many years -- almost $800 billion on trade. It's not sustainable. You can't do that. And now we're making great trade deals."
00:45:00 - 00:45:28 (28 sec),"But when some of the senators -- good people; I think they're good people. I just don't understand the thinking. So I say, India is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot. When we send a motorcycle to India, it's 100 percent tariff. They charge 100 percent. When India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing."
00:45:28 - 00:45:53 (24 sec),"So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax. It's called a mirror tax, but it's a reciprocal tax. Now, here's what I don't understand: I've had a lot of people -- Lindsey Graham. I said, Lindsey -- it's not his thing necessarily. It's not the thing that he's most adept at. But he's adept and he's smart."
00:45:53 - 00:46:14 (21 sec),"I said, ""Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci-..."" If they charge us, we charge them. He goes, ""That makes sense to me."" [Laughter] And then he gets on to judiciary and things that, frankly, he likes and finds very interesting. But he's a smart guy, and he said -- I'll never forget. It took me about a minute, which is a long time."
00:46:14 - 00:46:34 (21 sec),"I did a bad description. It's so easy. They charge 100; we charge nothing. Now we have reciprocal, so it's 100. But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and don't like tariffs for whatever reason might be -- and that's okay. What's going to happen is, in many cases, instead of 100 and 100, you're going to have zero and zero, so you won't have any tariff."
00:46:34 - 00:46:56 (21 sec),"Okay? It's going to happen. That's going to happen. But you have to -- you have to start working on some of the senators that say ""I can't approve this deal."" I say, ""You know what? I want to just charge India"" -- as an example, I'm using it. But India is a very high-tariff nation. I mean, nobody -- nobody knows it because nobody knows what they're doing in Washington."
00:46:56 - 00:47:20 (24 sec),"[Laughter] But India is a very, very high-tariff nation, and they charge tremendous -- tremendous numbers. So they charge 100. So I say, ""I'm not going to charge 100, but I'm going to charge 25 percent."" And I hear this turmoil in the Senate because we're charging 25. So I call a couple of the guys up. I say, ""Fellas, listen, they're charging us 100 for the exact same product."
00:47:20 - 00:47:45 (25 sec),"I want to charge them 25."" And I feel so foolish charging 25 because it should be 100. ""But I'm doing 25 only because of you. I want to get your support."" ""Sir, that's not free trade."" Where do these people come from? [Laughter] Where do they come from? Where? Where do they come from? I need your help. I need your help -- the voters' help."
00:47:45 - 00:48:17 (32 sec),"Where do they come from? So it can only be one of two or three things. Number one, I know they're very smart people. I know they are. And I even like some of them. [Laughter] But they're smart. So we take that out of the equation. So even -- and I know they don't have evil intentions. And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe -- you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous."
00:48:17 - 00:48:49 (32 sec),"Campaign contributions -- they're very, very generous people. Can that be possible? I don't think so. I hope not. Because we're talking about our country. We can't allow a country to charge 100 percent and we get nothing for the same exact product. For one thing, they don't respect us. They think we're ""stupido."" They don't respect us. [Laughter] But let me tell you something: The world respects our country again."
00:48:49 - 00:49:39 (50 sec),"They respect us. And America is now booming like never before. Other countries are doing very poorly. Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful. Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the Fed. We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed. We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the Fed. So with all of those things -- and we want a strong dollar, but let's be reasonable."
00:49:39 - 00:50:00 (21 sec),"You understand that. With all of that, we're doing great. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? There's no inflation, essentially. There's no inflation. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? If we didn't do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market?"
00:50:00 - 00:50:38 (38 sec),"If we didn't do quantitative -- and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar. A little bit. I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's going to be great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business. Since the election, we've created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy."
00:50:38 - 00:51:20 (42 sec),"5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country. These are jobs that were never coming back to our country. Remember? Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked Hillary winning the election, instead of being up almost 50 percent with the stock market, you would have been down 50 percent."
00:51:20 - 00:52:00 (40 sec),"It was heading down. It was going to be a disaster. We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps. Nobody ever thought that was possible. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years. And African American -- and you've heard me say this many times -- Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows."
00:52:00 - 00:52:41 (41 sec),"And African American income has reached an all-time high. So when I'm on the debate stage with one of these maniacs -- [Laughter] -- I mean, trains to Hawaii. ""How do you get to Europe?"" ""We haven't figured that one out yet. We don't use airplanes anymore."" [Laughter] You saw what I'm doing in California, right?"
00:52:41 - 00:53:03 (22 sec),"They have a fast train. The fast train goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It's over budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, so they have a great idea -- the new governor; nice guy. Yeah, he's a nice guy. When I'm with him face to face, nice. When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me. [Laughter] He called me up. He said, ""You're a great President."
00:53:03 - 00:53:30 (27 sec),"You're doing a great job."" He actually did, two weeks ago, three weeks. So he'll probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House. Everybody else does. [Laughter] Check them. Check them. Check them. Called me up three or four weeks ago. I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that's one of the problems they have."
00:53:30 - 00:53:47 (17 sec),"I said, ""You got to get those forests."" We can't keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly. Got to clean it up. It's called management. When a tree falls, you can't let the environmentalist say you can't take that tree out. It becomes like a matchstick, that tree."
00:53:47 - 00:54:16 (29 sec),"It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves -- every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so -- a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it. The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed. You got to have management. But he called me up the other day, recently -- let's say four weeks ago or so. He said, ""I just want to tell you you're a great President and you're one of the smartest people I've ever met."" That's what he said."
00:54:16 - 00:54:35 (19 sec),"Now, that's what he said. Will he admit it? No, I doubt it. [Laughter] But that's what he said. ""And you're doing a great job."" And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is -- [Laughter] -- it's okay. That's okay. We have great talks. I mean, I like him. Gavin Newsom."
00:54:35 - 00:55:02 (27 sec),"I like him. Nice guy. But they say things -- you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see two days later they're giving a news conference -- just like, where did that guy come from? Where did he come from? But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well -- except, of course, for the Never Trumpers."
00:55:02 - 00:55:43 (41 sec),"But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. [Laughter] Mouth to mouth. Mouth to mouth. They're hanging in. A couple of them. I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong. Not only Never Trumpers. You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline. They're basically dishonest people -- because, look, let's face it: Whether you like me or not -- if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges -- it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges."
00:55:43 - 00:56:19 (36 sec),"And 17 appellate division judges. That we've got the best economy maybe in our history. That we've got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history. That we've cut more regulations in two years than any President has ever done, whether it's for eight or beyond. That we've taken care of our military with -- $1.7 billion."
00:56:19 - 00:56:39 (20 sec),"Think of that. Think of what we did. Think of what we did with our military. Think of the numbers that we have for our military. We have numbers -- nobody has ever heard of these numbers before. And you know, part of the problem that we have -- because I'm a cost cutter. But -- and you are all cost cutters."
00:56:39 - 00:57:07 (28 sec),"But we have to take care of our military. We have to. Seven hundred billions dollars we spent. And that was the first year. And then the second year, $716 billion. Now, I have no choice. I'd like to spend much less. Obama was spending much less but our military was being depleted. He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end."
00:57:07 - 00:57:33 (26 sec),"And, by the way, as of probably today or tomorrow, we will actually have 100 percent of the caliphate in Syria. One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And we'll leave a small group of guys and gals. But we want to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. It's time."
00:57:33 - 00:58:24 (51 sec),"Been in these wars. We were going to be in Syria for four months. We ended up five years. This fighting -- they just like to fight. We want to fix our country. We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools. We want to fix our country up. It's time. It's time. But I was told by a general, who I had to fire -- I said, ""General, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate?"" He said, ""Sir, two years."" I said, ""I can't take it two years."" And then I flew to Iraq; first time I left the White House -- because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places."
00:58:24 - 00:58:40 (16 sec),"[Laughter] And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay? I figured it would look good. [Laughter] I figured it would look good. So I stayed in the White House. And I'll tell you what: I was there -- I told my wife, ""Go to Florida."
00:58:40 - 00:59:01 (21 sec),"Enjoy your Christmas."" I stayed for Thanksgiving. I said -- I mean, I was in the White House for a long time. Months. Months. I had cabin fever in the White House. [Laughter] But if you've got to have cabin fever, that's the place to do it, okay? [Laughter] But I was there, I don't know, for a number of months, through Christmas."
00:59:01 - 00:59:05 (4 sec),"I spent my New Year's all by myself. [Laughter, Audience calls out Awww]"
00:59:05 - 00:59:35 (29 sec),"Don't cry. All -- it was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns. [Laughter] I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns. I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, ""Man..."" They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn. I told people, ""I'm in this mess"" -- you know, people don't know how big the White House."
00:59:35 - 00:59:54 (20 sec),"First of all, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world. It's really -- I made a lot of money with luxury. This building is -- 1799 -- which, of course, when President Xi comes, I say ""1799,"" like it's old. To him, that's like a brand-new house in China. [Laughter] In China, they go back -- they go back 8,000 years."
00:59:54 - 01:00:29 (35 sec),"So that's -- that's like a new -- that's like a new residence. But I sat in the White House for months and months, except I took a day off. I flew to a lovely place called Iraq, and I flew at night and I got there at night. And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, ""Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off."" I say, ""Why?"" [Laughter] ""Because we're getting ready to land."" We're an hour out."
01:00:29 - 01:00:46 (18 sec),"I said, ""What about the shades?"" ""Well, we want it better than that. May be like [Inaudible]. So we turned the lights off, put the shades down. This is a big seven forty -- Air Force One. And we're landing, and I go up and I look. And I've landed; I like to sit with pilots. I respect people that know what they're doing, and these are the best in the world."
01:00:46 - 01:01:11 (25 sec),"I really do. These are the best in the world. And the pilot says, ""Sir, we're landing in approximately one and a half minutes."" I say, ""But there's no runway."" ""No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir."" I say, ""I don't see it."" I have pretty good vision. [Laughter] At least for my age I have good vision."
01:01:11 - 01:01:30 (19 sec),"[Laughter] I guess for my age I have great vision. But I donât have vision like a 35-year-old captain. He said, ""No, it's right up there."" I said, ""I'm sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again? Captain, there's no runway."" Anyway -- he sits right up there and we land. There's practically not lights."
01:01:30 - 01:02:00 (29 sec),"These are little pin spots. And I said, think of this: We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we can't land with the lights on -- [Laughter] -- 20 years later. How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights. But I met some incredible people."
01:02:00 - 01:02:24 (24 sec),I met some incredible people -- generals. One of them came from Syria -- the operation in Syria. And I was upset with my generals because they weren't getting it finished. I want the job done. I want to bring our people back home. It's not fair. And this is why I flew. So I met generals I didn't know.
01:02:24 - 01:02:48 (24 sec),"General one, general two, general three. I mean, these generals -- there's no person in Hollywood that could play the role. These guys are like perfect people. I said, ""What's your name? ""Sir, my name is Raisin."" What the hell kind of a name? [Laughter] I said, ""Raisin, like the fruit?"" He goes, ""Yes, sir, Raisin."" ""What's your last name?"" ""Caine."
01:02:48 - 01:03:12 (24 sec),"Raisin Caine."" [Laughter] I said, ""You got to be kidding me."" It's true. Raisin Caine. I just made him a big star. [Laughter] Just like I did with Mattis when I said, ""We're going to give you a new nickname, because 'Chaos' is not a good nickname."" So we changed his name. Called him ""Mad Dog."" But it wasnât working too well."
01:03:12 - 01:03:28 (16 sec),"Mad Dog wasn't working too well. So what happened is I flew to Iraq. I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what's going on, than I do from generals. I do. I hate to say it. And I tell that to the generals all the time. But I didn't have to go there."
01:03:28 - 01:03:47 (19 sec),"I didn't have to go there. Because I meet -- and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing. We must have spent $3 billion building it. It's one of the reasons I don't want to leave Iraq so fast. I said, ""Well, how do we leave this thing?"" So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants."
01:03:47 - 01:04:10 (23 sec),"And I said, ""Bring the cameras. I'm going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing."" [Laughter] And I said to the generals, ""Listen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left."" ""It won't, sir."" And I said, ""Tell me why it won't."" ""It won't, sir."
01:04:10 - 01:04:49 (39 sec),"If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster."" ""Okay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can"" -- ""Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week."" I said, ""One week? I was told two years."" [Laughter] One week? ""That's right, sir. We're only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over -- from the base that you're right on, right now, sir."
01:04:49 - 01:05:08 (19 sec),"They won't know what the hell hit them."" ""They won't know what the hell hit them, sir."" And I said, ""Why didn't my other generals tell me that? Why didn't they tell me that?"" I said, ""Did you tell them that?"" ""Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders."
01:05:08 - 01:05:36 (28 sec),"You're the first one to ask us our opinion."" It's true. It's true. True. True. So I went back and I said, ""I'm going to get back to you soon, Raisin. I think you're great."" [Laughter] ""I like you, Raisin Caine."" But I did say -- I said, ""Well, hey, listen, we're in Iraq. Isn't that very far away from..."" ""I was here in a very short time, sir."
01:05:36 - 01:06:00 (24 sec),"I flew right in."" Of course, he's taking a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, you know. But incredible. What you learn from being on the site -- my father was a builder. He always used to say, ""Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk."" It's true. It's true. He'd say, ""You got to be on this site."
01:06:00 - 01:06:18 (18 sec),"You got to be with the contractors. You got to see if they're ripping you off. You've got to collect every nail that's dropped, every piece of wood. You can sell it. You got to be on the site. You got to see while they're building, while they're under construction, is that wall straight or if it's crooked."
01:06:18 - 01:06:40 (22 sec),"And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down."" True. You donât get rich by sitting behind a desk. So I didn't want to do that. And I'm in the White House and I was lonely. I said, ""Let's go to Iraq."" [Laughter] And I had a hell of a meeting in Iraq."
01:06:40 - 01:07:09 (29 sec),"And I'll tell you, those generals -- not just Raisin Caine, General Caine. Those generals were great. They were great. They knew their stuff. They were gung-ho. And it is true -- I mean, you talk central casting. These guys -- you couldnât -- I mean, it's incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he's the star of the movie."
01:07:09 - 01:07:38 (29 sec),"That happened once before, you know. That did happen once before. Remember? They brought a man in -- a sergeant, a drill sergeant -- to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant. The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn't. That's because Hollywood discriminates against our people."
01:07:38 - 01:08:12 (34 sec),"You know the movie I'm talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie. But while we're making great strides, and our country is doing as well -- and maybe, in many ways, better than it's ever done before -- Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism. They want to replace individual rights with total government domination. [Audience Boos]"
01:08:12 - 01:08:35 (23 sec),"Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American healthcare. Their radical government-run plan -- if you call it that -- would lead to colossal tax increases -- increases like you've never seen before -- and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans. [Audience calls out No]"
01:08:35 - 01:09:16 (41 sec),"And we have some great private coverage, and we've initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost. But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal. [Audience Boos]"
01:09:16 - 01:09:55 (39 sec),"Under the Green New Deal -- which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student -- [Laughter] -- it's true. It's true. Who would believe it? It so -- it's so bad. But I don't -- I'll be honest with you, folks. I said -- you know, it's Saturday morning, and I said, ""Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time?"" He said, ""Yeah, would you do that?"" By the way, everybody okay?"
01:09:55 - 01:10:20 (25 sec),"I haven't seen anybody leaving. I haven't seen anybody. I know one thing: If Mark Levin gets up and leaves, I'll finish very quickly, because then I know. [Laughter] But I haven't seen anyone leaving. Nobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times -- a lot of times -- well, one time, the press said people left."
01:10:20 - 01:10:46 (27 sec),"Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back. [Laughter] Two people. They showed two empty seats in a stadium of 19,000. They showed two empty seats. The people left right in front of me, and I said, ""Oh, man, maybe this isn't a good job I'm doing."" Then they came back."
01:10:46 - 01:11:15 (28 sec),"They went to the bathroom. [Laughter] And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats. The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we're now the leader in the world."
01:11:15 - 01:11:40 (26 sec),"We're the biggest now in the world because of moves that I've made. Happened over the last two years, by the way. And we're trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years. We think we're almost very close to getting them approved. When that happens, we'll go probably another 30 to 40 percent."
01:11:40 - 01:12:13 (33 sec),"We need pipeline approval. We're going to have it very quickly. It would have taken -- it was going to be a 14- to 15-year process. We should have it done. We'll pick up 30 to 40 percent more. Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads. Oh, that's not so bad. They want you to have one car instead of two, and it should be electric, okay?"
01:12:13 - 01:12:35 (22 sec),"So tell people, no more cars. No more cars. I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan. What do you think, Meadows? How is this? Will the auto industry be good? I donât think so. It's not looking good. I think maybe -- maybe you're going to see some bad stock prices if that passes."
01:12:35 - 01:13:01 (26 sec),"It would end air travel. But you'll get on a train, don't worry about it. You just have to cross off about 95 percent of the world. And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States. New York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again."
01:13:01 - 01:13:27 (26 sec),"I don't think so. This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for 20 years -- white hair. See, I don't have white hair. [Laughter] I donât have white hair. No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she's ranting and raving like a lunatic. [Laughter]"
01:13:27 - 01:14:01 (35 sec),"And these senators -- these senators: ""Yes, I agree with this. Yes, I agree."" The crazy female senator from the state of Ohio, the state of Hawaii. Right? She's like -- she's like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad. But she's standing in the hallway."
01:14:01 - 01:14:39 (38 sec),"And she didn't know too much about the plan because she's -- you know, she can't understand that plan. [Laughter] Which probably makes her smart, actually. Now, this is the senator from Hawaii, and they're saying to her, ""What do you think? Well, I don't know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I'm in favor of the plan."" [Laughter] I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. So she's in favor of the plan, but you won't be able to get to -- well, we can take boats, I guess."
01:14:39 - 01:15:10 (30 sec),We'll go back to boats. This is the new Democrat platform for the -- and I don't want to talk them out of it. I don't. I don't. I swear I don't. This is a killer. I got to get off this subject. I want them to embrace this plan. I want them to go and sell this plan. I just want to be the Republican that runs against them for that.
01:15:10 - 01:15:40 (30 sec),"I'm going to regret this speech. This speech should have been delivered one year from now, not now, damn it. [Laughter] Because they're going to grab out together, and they're going to say, ""You know, this guy is really laying for us."" I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year. [Laughter] Because I've destroyed her political career, and now I won't get a chance to run against her, and I wouldâve loved it. [Laughter] We got to -- you know, I don't want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that's actually got talent."
01:15:40 - 01:15:58 (19 sec),That would be terrible. [Laughter] So I do like the Green New Deal. [Laughter] I respect it greatly. It should be part of the dialogue of the next election. [Laughter] And I think it has tremendous promise and tremendous potential for the future of our country. Socialism is not about the environment.
01:15:58 - 01:16:17 (19 sec),"It's not about justice. It's not about virtue. Socialism is about only one thing. It's called ""power for the ruling class."" That's what it is. Look at what's happening in Venezuela and so many other places. All of us are here today because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism."
01:16:17 - 01:16:57 (40 sec),"And I heard, yesterday, a great speech from our Vice President Mike Pence, talking about this very subject -- and talking about it beautifully. The future belongs to those who believe in freedom. I have said it before and I'll say it again: America will never be a socialist country -- ever."
01:16:57 - 01:16:57 (0 sec),[Audience Chants USA]
01:16:57 - 01:17:09 (12 sec),"Young Americans -- I love young Americans. Speaking of young Americans -- Candace, stand up. Candace is getting married. Stand up. You've been incredible. Thank you. Your whole group has been great. You're getting married. Seems like a nice guy to me. [Laughter] Congratulations. You've been so great."
01:17:09 - 01:17:41 (32 sec),"Thank you very much, Candace. Thanks. And, Charlie, what a job you're doing. Where's Charlie? Where's Charlie? Where is Charlie Kirk? Because he has done an incredible job. Thank you very much, Charlie. But young Americans like you are leading the revival of American liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance."
01:17:41 - 01:18:21 (40 sec),"The anger -- the unbelievable anger -- I see it every day. Fortunately, for you, it's mostly pointed at me. [Laughter] You have the courage to speak the truth, to do what is right, and to fight for what you believe, and keep doing it. We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas."
01:18:21 - 01:18:57 (36 sec),"These ideas are dangerous. Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus. And, by the way, there's a young gentleman with us today. There's a young gentleman. I turned on my television the other day, and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face."
01:18:57 - 01:19:36 (39 sec),"Violently punched. And I said that's disgusting. By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things. But, of course, we would never do that. Because if I ever said violence, they would say, ""Donald Trump attacked."" No, no, no. Just for the media: I'm sure he's a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum."
01:19:36 - 01:20:09 (33 sec),"[Laughter] I've been there before with those people. I donât want to do it again. So, the man's name is Hayden Williams. Where's Hayden? Where is he? Where is he? Hayden, come up here. Come up here."
01:20:09 - 01:20:29 (19 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. So, at the Leadership Institute, we're committed to making campuses great again. And I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak. It's great -- it's great that I'm being recognized, and -- but there's so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse, if they dare to speak up on campus."
01:20:29 - 01:20:58 (29 sec),"So I'm glad that we could -- we could, you know, bring this to the forefront. And I'd just like to say, you know, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat. So, you know, it's as important now than ever the work at Leadership Institute and Campus Reform -- you know, exposing these liberal abuses to the public -- it's as important now as ever."
01:20:58 - 01:21:10 (12 sec),"And these students -- these students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom, and frankly, a love for you, Mr. President. So if you keep defending us, we'll keep defending you."
01:21:10 - 01:21:16 (5 sec),Thank you.
01:21:16 - 01:21:16 (1 sec),Thank you.
01:21:16 - 01:21:35 (19 sec),"Stay here for a second. So, here's the one thing. I was going to call him, but I don't have to now. I see him here. But here's the one thing: I learned a number of things. First of all, he can take a punch. If Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take a punch. [Laughter] Because you werenât going to go down no matter how -- that was a hell of a hard punch."
01:21:35 - 01:22:11 (36 sec),"He was a strong guy. But you know what? You've got yourself a great lawyer. I know your lawyer. She is a great lawyer. Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him. But he's probably got nothing, but sue him forever. But sue the college, the university. And maybe sue the state. Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us. Remember that."
01:22:11 - 01:22:52 (41 sec),"He took a punch for all of us. And we can never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden -- here's the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man. That's okay. [Laughter] Go get 'em, Hayden. Today I'm proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech -- if they want federal research dollars. [Audience Chants USA]"
01:22:52 - 01:23:57 (65 sec),"If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people, and old people, to speak. Free speech. And if they don't, it will be very costly. That'll be signed very soon. Every day, we're restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all."
01:23:57 - 01:24:22 (25 sec),"We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right. And we believe in religious liberty. And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms -- which is under siege, folks. They have a lot of plans. It's under siege."
01:24:22 - 01:25:17 (55 sec),"Be careful. But I'll protect you, I promise you that. I'll protect you. Because it all has to come through my office. And we hopefully are going to be here for six more years, so you're in good shape. We believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare. And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust."
01:25:17 - 01:25:59 (42 sec),"Every day, my presidency will defend American families. We will defend America's workers -- our great, great cherished workers -- that now we're taking care of. They're not losing their jobs. We're creating those jobs. We're not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore. We will defend the American way of life, and we will always defend America's borders."
01:25:59 - 01:26:39 (40 sec),"Because without borders, as I've said many times before, we don't have a country. The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet. Deadly cartels constantly -- daily, hourly -- violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill thousands and thousands of our citizens violently."
01:26:39 - 01:27:10 (30 sec),"What are these people talking about when they talk about the border? ""Keep it open."" Keep what open? Have you been there? Have you seen? I just got back. I've been there many times. I see what's happening. I don't like it. But I have to tell you, our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our law enforcement, the job they do -- and they don't have the backup of a wall, in many cases -- the job they do is incredible."
01:27:10 - 01:27:39 (29 sec),"These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere. When I was there two weeks ago, 26 people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande. Sounds nice, right? The Rio Grande. Rough. Rough stuff. Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing."
01:27:39 - 01:28:07 (28 sec),"And the paper doesn't write about it. The news doesn't write about it. In the last two years alone, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests. Think of what that means. Think of that -- arrests. I'm not talking about people coming in. I'm talking they went out and arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder."
01:28:07 - 01:28:37 (30 sec),"Who the hell wants to do that? Thank God they're doing it because I don't want to do it. It's dangerous. It's hard. But they love our country, and they're tough people, but they love our country. Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders."
01:28:37 - 01:28:55 (19 sec),"These are people that ICE is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we donât want them. We don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years. You want them to pay a price, but we don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years."
01:28:55 - 01:29:23 (27 sec),"And all the nonsense you hear about ""the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have"" -- it's not true, folks. Okay? It's false. It's false propaganda. Right? One recent study from FAIR -- F-A-I-R -- found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents."
01:29:23 - 01:29:45 (23 sec),"Those are the numbers. And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are -- the number is staggering. The number of illegals -- far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population. But you don't hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world."
01:29:45 - 01:30:16 (30 sec),Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there. Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly -- so badly. Incredible people. But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place. The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy.
01:30:16 - 01:30:49 (33 sec),"Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word ""rape."" The press went after me; I couldn't believe it. I said, ""Will it be like this always?"" The answer was yes."
01:30:49 - 01:31:45 (56 sec),"It even got worse. From day one, I mention the word ""rape."" If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what's really happening. That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts. Illegal immigration is not compassionate. It's inhumane, unjust, and cruel. The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that 2,000-mile trek up through Mexico -- and frankly, I wish Mexico would stop them at their northern border, at our -- I wish Mexico would stop them."
01:31:45 - 01:32:09 (24 sec),"Because you know, they have a border. They call it their southern border. It's 2,000 miles down from our southern border. I wish Mexico would stop them. But they have their own difficulties. Frankly, I understand that. We're working along well with them. And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we're doing."
01:32:09 - 01:32:42 (32 sec),"But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border. Think of that. True story, told to me by the Border Patrol. So true and so sad. Think of how evil that is. Think of how bad it is. Those caravans -- you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people."
01:32:42 - 01:33:14 (32 sec),"But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers. You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now. ""And what is it that you want asylum for? Why are you coming to America?"" ""Uh, murder."" She goes, ""What?"" ""Murder."" I mean, what's going on is incredible. And when those caravans are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to -- I've cut it way back."
01:33:14 - 01:33:39 (25 sec),"I've cut it way back. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Do you think they're giving us, as we say, their best and their finest? ""Oh, let's send our best people up to America. Let's have our best people go in the caravan so we can give America our greatest people."" No, no, no, no. They give us some very bad people."
01:33:39 - 01:34:14 (35 sec),"People with big, long crime records. People with tremendous violence in their past. Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers. They want to keep their good people because they're smart. It's so sad to see how stupid we've been. Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago."
01:34:14 - 01:34:50 (36 sec),"Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, last month I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people -- and they're good people -- some senators, mostly -- I tell you, the House has been fantastic."
01:34:50 - 01:35:04 (14 sec),"The House -- you know, backing we've had from the House has really been -- I'm talking about in the last short period of time. There's a lot of spirit in the House, and I think in the Senate too, but we're going to have to see because we have a vote coming up. And a lot of people talk about precedent. Precedent."
01:35:04 - 01:35:28 (24 sec),"That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we don't want. They're going to do that anyway, folks. The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election. That's the best way to stop that. They're going to do it anyway. They'll do it anyway."
01:35:28 - 01:35:53 (25 sec),"I watch -- good people, they're friends of mine, ""We're very concerned with setting precedent."" That's ""precedent"" not ""president."" [Laughter] Precedent. ""We're very concerned about setting precedent."" I'm very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country."
01:35:53 - 01:36:16 (23 sec),"That's what I'm concerned about. And the Democrats, they're going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it won't have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency. Because let me tell you -- they don't like it when I say it -- but we are being invaded. We're being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals."
01:36:16 - 01:36:47 (31 sec),"And we have to stop it. And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit. Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in Belarus, to ensure political stability in Burundi, and to defend the sovereignty of Lebanon."
01:36:47 - 01:37:13 (27 sec),"And you know what? That's okay. In Lebanon -- it's good. Fine. Use it. But we need it right here in our country. We have to use it for our country. Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands. Now we are protecting, finally, our people. You. Our people."
01:37:13 - 01:37:48 (34 sec),"And we are proudly standing with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants. If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border."
01:37:48 - 01:38:16 (28 sec),"We need an immigration policy that helps all Americans thrive, flourish, prosper. We need an immigration policy that's going to be great for our corporations and our great companies. We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens. And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities."
01:38:16 - 01:38:31 (15 sec),"And we want to end catch-and-release. We catch them, we realize they're a criminal, and we have to release them. Think of this: They come onto our land, they put one foot on our land. We now have to take them through a massive court trial. Who does this? Other countries say, ""Get the hell out of here."" We have to take them through court."
01:38:31 - 01:39:08 (37 sec),"So we catch them. We talk to them. If they're criminals, or if they're not, we release them. We say, ""Come back for a hearing in front of a judge."" You know how many judges you need to do this? We have 900,000 people backlogged. That's the good news. The bad news? Nobody shows up. Three percent of the people come back for a trial."
01:39:08 - 01:39:38 (30 sec),"It's insane. Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it. We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery. Every American, no matter where they're born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system. It is such -- you talk about an emergency. Our immigration system is so broken, folks."
01:39:38 - 01:40:07 (29 sec),"It's so broken. It's so sad to see. It's incompetent. It's laughed at all over the world. We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in Mexico. From China. They have a baby on our land. The baby becomes a citizen. ""Welcome to the United States"" for hopefully 90 years. Okay? And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen."
01:40:07 - 01:40:43 (36 sec),"This is like crazy. They used to call it ""anchor babies"" but they don't use that term anymore because it doesn't sound nice. Our laws are so crazy. But one by one, we're finding ways. You know, they call them loopholes. A lot of our laws -- loopholes. Well, I'm finding loopholes to get around the loophole."
01:40:43 - 01:41:17 (34 sec),"Okay? [Laughter] Because our Congress can't act. They can't act. They just can't act. The Democrats in Congress don't want to touch any of it. Visa lottery -- that's where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, ""Oh, here's a wonderful person. Wonderful."" You know, he killed four people."
01:41:17 - 01:41:41 (24 sec),"Here's -- here's another wonderful. [Laughter] And then they get in and we say, ""Gee, that person just came into our country. He just robbed a store and killed somebody."" How is that possible? Because they send us the people they don't want. The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations."
01:41:41 - 01:42:03 (22 sec),"Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute. We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves. We have people coming in. We support them from the day they come in until the day they die. We can't do that as a country."
01:42:03 - 01:42:26 (23 sec),"We can't afford to do that as a country. Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream. But that's going to be good for us in 2020. They're embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion. [Audience Boos]"
01:42:26 - 01:42:56 (30 sec),"Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death. Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I don't think I've ever heard, in Virginia, the governor -- a Democrat -- stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside."
01:42:56 - 01:43:13 (17 sec),"He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he'll talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done. And if they didn't want the child, who is now outside of the womb -- long outside of the womb -- they will execute the baby after birth. [Audience Boos]"
01:43:13 - 01:43:43 (31 sec),"They will execute the baby after birth. And that's one many people have never even heard of or thought about. This is a radical agenda by the Democrats. And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it. By the way, I have to say one thing: They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy."
01:43:43 - 01:44:12 (29 sec),They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to. But -- but -- big but -- they always stick together. And the Republicans don't remember that. Remember that. They always stick together. They vote in blocs. They have 47. We had a tremendous victory. We were given no credit. I can't go and campaign for all of the people in the House.
01:44:12 - 01:44:46 (34 sec),"Too many. And guys like Meadows wins by so many points he doesn't need any help. He doesn't need it. I say, ""Mark, do you need any help?"" ""No, I'm okay."" [Laughter] He'll win by 30, 35. They're okay. These guys -- you know a funny thing? The ones that love Trump, the ones that are really the Trumpers -- like Meadows, Jordan, Gates, so many of them."
01:44:46 - 01:45:06 (20 sec),"I donât want to -- I could just name so many. They're the ones that win with that. I mean, it's like they don't even have an election. It's the ones that sort of -- they're a little shy about embracing what we're all about, they get clobbered. They get clobbered. Take a look. Those are the ones that get clobbered."
01:45:06 - 01:45:31 (26 sec),"But the good news is they're all starting to find that out. Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions. Virtually every Democrat voted against protecting these precious babies. Every one. They vote in groups. And we did have that great victory."
01:45:31 - 01:45:56 (25 sec),"We won for 51. And two that we didn't like got out. They said they retired. They didn't retire. They were retired. They said, ""These two senators have decided to retire."" No, no, no. They retired because they had like very little support. Like how about 5 percent? Any percent. No, we did great."
01:45:56 - 01:46:42 (46 sec),"We had 53 we picked up in the Senate. They were going to win the Senate, remember? And I'll tell you, folks, I worked hard. I did 32 big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals. And the fake news back there, they love to say ""Donald Trump suffered a big defeat."" First of all, we won the Senate, which, frankly, judges -- you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the Senate, far more important."
01:46:42 - 01:47:12 (30 sec),"I really worked hard. But think of it. We won the Senate and we had this, like, tremendous victory. We get no credit at all. Wait until you see what happens. They say, ""Donald Trump suffered a humiliating defeat."" I said, ""I wasn't running."" [Laughter] And one of the commentators -- and I appreciate it -- one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, ""Excuse me, he didn't run."" You know, not all our candidates were exactly great."
01:47:12 - 01:47:38 (26 sec),"Let's face it. You know, you can only do so much. But wait until you see what's happening when I do run. And what they don't say is -- governor of Ohio, great guy. Mike. Mike. Mike was down six. He won by seven with one day. Right? He was down by six. One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech."
01:47:38 - 01:48:01 (23 sec),Jim Jordan was there. Everybody was there. It was a fantastic crowd like this. Like this. And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us. And he ended up winning. He was down by six; he won by seven. One day. Then we have Georgia -- the governor of Georgia. Great guy. Where's Georgia?
01:48:01 - 01:48:25 (25 sec),"Great guy. He was losing in the primary by 10. I got a call from David Perdue and Sonny Perdue -- two great guys. ""Could you endorse him?"" I said, ""Let me check."" And I checked him. He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper. [Laughter] And I said, ""I love this guy."" He's down by 10. He won by 40. Can you believe that?"
01:48:25 - 01:48:46 (21 sec),"I endorsed him, Mark. He won by 40. Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party -- not Democratic. It's Democrat. We have to do that. You know, it sounds prettier when we use ""Democratic."" I even like -- I hate to say in the speech, the ""Democrat Party"" because it doesn't sound good."
01:48:46 - 01:49:11 (25 sec),"But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't. [Laughter] They should change it because it sounds much better. Rhetorically, it's much better. Much better. But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address. I didn't think she was great. But she's their star."
01:49:11 - 01:49:18 (7 sec),"And who showed up? Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and President Obama. [Audience Boos]"
01:49:18 - 01:50:03 (45 sec),"And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard. And all our man had was Trump. [Laughter] And we kicked their ass. True. We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport. It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back. The problem was they gave the press, like these guys -- they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them couldn't see properly."
01:50:03 - 01:50:35 (33 sec),"I was so angry. But we had 55,000 people show up. I said, ""You're going to win the election."" He won the election. He won it fairly easily, against their star. And now David Perdue is going to win for senator in 2020. And then -- and then we had Florida, and many others. And we have a candidate, Ron DeSantis -- a friend."
01:50:35 - 01:50:57 (21 sec),"A friend of many of us in this room. But nobody knew he was running. He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win. He was scheduled to be the next governor of Florida. But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt. He's been a defender of me against these phony charges of Russia."
01:50:57 - 01:51:16 (19 sec),"Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. My wife said, ""You never spoke to anybody from Russia, darling."" I said, ""That's right."" [Laughter] But Ron DeSantis -- I like people that defend me. You know, when people defend me, I defend them. So he came. That's why I like Mark. That's why I like Mark Levin."
01:51:16 - 01:51:41 (26 sec),"And I'm not sure a lot of people like him. He's tough as hell. But I like him. I love him. But then we have Florida. So, Ron DeSantis is at three. Three. He calls up, ""Sir, can I have your endorsement?"" I said, ""Ron, you're at three. Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner -- has 22 million in the bank."
01:51:41 - 01:52:03 (22 sec),"His poll numbers are very good. He's up in the 20s or 30s."" I said, ""Ron, don't make me do this, Ron."" [Laughter] ""Sir, I can win."" ""All right, Ron. Here we go."" Because I know if he loses -- which almost never happens when I endorse somebody. Almost never. Only one time, and that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election."
01:52:03 - 01:52:29 (26 sec),"Nobody knew I did it. They got home, they said, ""I didn't know Trump endorsed him."" But we rarely, rarely lose. But I said, ""Ron, don't do it."" I said, ""All right, I'll do it."" He went from 3 to 60. To 60. And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support. He had every celebrity go into Florida."
01:52:29 - 01:52:55 (26 sec),"He had money all over the place. And Ron was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him. And we now have a great governor in the state of Florida. And I could mention many others -- other governors, many other states. But I'm not going to bore you with it. And I think -- I really think that it's incredible what we did in the midterms."
01:52:55 - 01:53:20 (26 sec),"I think it's incredible. Governor of Florida. Governor of Ohio. Remember, ""You can't win unless you win the state of Ohio."" We got the governor of Ohio, and he's great. Mike. We love you, Mike. As we defend American values at home, we are also defending. American security abroad. We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything."
01:53:20 - 01:53:46 (26 sec),"And we will never forget our military. We will never forget our veterans. We are taking care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor. Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks."
01:53:46 - 01:54:17 (31 sec),And we got them Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists. You had people that took advantage of our veterans. They've hit them. They were sadists. They were sick people. You couldnât fire them. You had thieves that were stealing -- openly stealing. You couldn't fire them. I got a bill passed: VA Accountability.
01:54:17 - 01:54:36 (20 sec),"Now you look at the guy, you say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired. Get out."" Nobody thought we could get it. For 40 years they tried to get it. For 40 years they tried to get it; they couldn't get it. And VA Choice, they thought -- for many, many decades they'd been trying to get VA Choice."
01:54:36 - 01:55:02 (26 sec),"You couldnât get it. Now, instead of waiting on line for two days, nine days, three weeks -- people were dying. People that weren't very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later. Now these great veterans, if there's a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor. We pay the bills."
01:55:02 - 01:55:33 (30 sec),"They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved -- for our veterans. We love our veterans. And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from Vietnam, where I had very productive meetings with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Very productive."
01:55:33 - 01:55:50 (17 sec),"We get along. We've developed a good relationship -- very good -- and made great historic progress. And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: ""Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that."" You know, they're telling me how to negotiate."
01:55:50 - 01:56:11 (21 sec),"These guys died. One administration gave billions of dollars to him and got nothing. And we haven't given him anything yet. I look forward to maybe doing something at some point. But I know one thing: I'm going to get other countries to give. Maybe not us, but I'm going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out."
01:56:11 - 01:56:42 (31 sec),"If it all works out. But I had to walk. Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal wasn't a deal that was acceptable to me. I don't like these deals that politicians make. They make a deal just for the sake of doing it. I don't want to do that. I want to make a deal that either works, or let's not make it. But the one thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up. No nuclear testing."
01:56:42 - 01:57:07 (25 sec),"We got our great people back. We get our great, great people. And that includes our beautiful, beautiful Otto -- Otto Warmbier -- whose parents I've gotten to know, who's incredible. And I'm in such a horrible position, because in one way I have to negotiate. In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto."
01:57:07 - 01:57:41 (34 sec),"And it's a very, very delicate balance. He was a special young man. And to see what happened was so bad. It was so bad. And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea, and any success that we hopefully have -- and we've had a lot. We're given no credit. They don't remember that, in the last days of the Obama administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on. Mountains were being -- these are big mountains."
01:57:41 - 01:58:01 (20 sec),"They were being shoved over three, four inches. People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons -- nuclear testing. So much. We're getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from many, many years ago. Mike Pence was in Hawaii. It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies."
01:58:01 - 01:58:22 (21 sec),"We've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to make progress. And I really think what we're doing there is very important. But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting. In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front."
01:58:22 - 01:58:43 (20 sec),"But you see, that's not what happened there. So already, I think we're negotiating. And I'll tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal. But they don't have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons. It's really a bad thing for them. So we'll see how it all goes."
01:58:43 - 01:59:06 (23 sec),"But I think it's going well. I think we learned a lot over the last couple of days. And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong. And that's an important thing, especially when we're dealing with this kind of a situation. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
01:59:06 - 01:59:32 (26 sec),"You saw that. Would you like to apologize? No. I'm not apologizing. Now you have a President who is standing up for America. After decades of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with American hands, American grit, and with beautiful, beautiful American steel."
01:59:32 - 02:00:05 (33 sec),"We are fighting to ensure that every young American inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul. Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of CPAC. And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible."
02:00:05 - 02:00:30 (26 sec),"Your organization is incredible. Matt and Mercedes, incredible. You're energized, you're mobilized, and you're engaged. We need your voice. We need your patriotism. We need your commitment. We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July. We are having, in Washington, D.C., a great tribute to America."
02:00:30 - 02:00:59 (29 sec),"I hope you can all come. Fourth of July -- keep it open. We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country. Those are the people we want. The Fourth of July. A salute to America. Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history. Now is the time to defend our American legacy."
02:00:59 - 02:01:23 (24 sec),"And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny. And, by the way, I'm watching those doors. Not one person has left, and I've been up here a long time. [Laughter] I said, ""Matt, is that okay?"" He said, ""I love it. Don't leave."" But not one person. So if you hear tomorrow, when they read ""people left"" -- nobody left early."
02:01:23 - 02:01:57 (34 sec),"There hasn't been one person that's left. But when you read it, you just say ""fake news."" This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God. Together, we are one people, one family, and one nation, forever united behind one great American flag."
02:01:57 - 02:02:33 (36 sec),"Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country. We're hooked in all over the country. Thank you very much. I want to thank CPAC. What a job they've done. What a job Matt Schlapp and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it's never been before. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much."
00:00:00 - 00:00:22 (23 sec),"That's such a great song. We should just let it play, right? [Laughter] We had a little luck with that song. And he's terrific -- a good supporter. We appreciate it. We really appreciate this, too. I know you have a record crowd; that's nice. It's always nice to set records. And I want to thank Sonny. And he's setting records."
00:00:22 - 00:00:39 (17 sec),"We're setting records together for farmers and for agriculture. We've had so many good weeks and good days, and it's only going to get better because we're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you're not even going to believe it. Your problem will be: What do we do? We need more acreage immediately."
00:00:39 - 00:00:56 (16 sec),"We got to plant. But I will say, we are doing some things with trade that are going to have a tremendous impact. You're going to be doing business with Canada, you're going to be doing business with places where it was very, very difficult to do business. It was very unfair. And a lot of great things are going to happen."
00:00:56 - 00:01:23 (28 sec),"So, I want to really thank everybody here, and I want to congratulate a very, very good and exciting football team that I watched yesterday, the New Orleans Saints. [Applause] You know, it's -- I can see there's a little group over here. I know who I'm talking to. The rest of the room is going like, Eh, I don't want to talk about that. [Laughter] But you have to say, Drew Brees -- he's one hell of a quarterback and it was a tremendous game."
00:01:23 - 00:01:50 (26 sec),"And so congratulations to the folks from this area and from this great state. [Applause] It's a great state. I'm thrilled to be here in a state that I've had a lot of luck with -- and I love a lot of people in this state; I know a lot of people -- for, really, a truly historic occasion. This is the 100th annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation -- 100 exactly."
00:01:50 - 00:02:22 (32 sec),"If it was 99 -- although, I was here for 99, too, I have to be honest, right? I like the farmers. What can I do? I like farmers. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. For 100 years, this organization has faithfully represented the men and women who are the backbone of our country, truly. Let us all show our appreciation for a very dear friend and a leader -- a great leader -- Zippy Duval."
00:02:22 - 00:02:56 (34 sec),"Where's Zippy? Zippy. [Applause] Where is, Zippy? What a job he does. He only called about 100 times to make sure I'm coming. [Laughter] Thank you, Zippy. Great job. On this special anniversary, we gather to celebrate America's proud farming heritage. Through your sweat, through all of your work, the strength of your hands, and the faith in your hearts, the American farmer feeds, and fuels, and sustains our nation."
00:02:56 - 00:03:29 (33 sec),"So true. We are joined today by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. Thank you, Governor, for being here. Thank you. Thank you, John Bel. [Applause] Thank you. Along with many members of Congress who are true champions of American agriculture. An incredibly talented man, a great doctor -- he knows more about healthcare than anybody, and he's somebody that -- he's really helped us out in so many different ways."
00:03:29 - 00:03:47 (19 sec),"And he's yours: Senator Bill Cassidy. Bill? Thank you very much, Bill. [Applause] Appreciate it. A woman who had a tremendous victory -- she came in for a short period of time. She was appointed, and it's always hard when you're appointed. If you look -- I don't know about this, Cindy, but you take a look -- they don't do too well."
00:03:47 - 00:04:17 (30 sec),"You did very well. You won in an incredible state: Mississippi. Cindy Hyde-Smith, thank you. That was a great win. [Applause] A brilliant guy -- he's very deceiving. My wife said, I love watching him on television. And I said, Who? John Kennedy. I said, John Kennedy? I don't know. But, you know, I thought maybe she was talking about the other John Kennedy."
00:04:17 - 00:04:37 (20 sec),"She was talking -- this is a man who is totally brilliant. You know, I don't know if you know what this means: Oxford. Right? He went to Oxford. Oxford is a very -- I'm very much into the world of schools. Oxford -- you have to be very, very smart to go to Oxford. And he's very smart. He also loves this state."
00:04:37 - 00:04:55 (18 sec),"He loves the people. We gave a rally the night before he won that was incredible. And I looked -- and I looked at that crowd. We had to have 40,000 people or more at a hangar -- an airport hangar. I said, You know, John Kennedy? You're going to win. And he won and he won big. And he's my friend. John Kennedy."
00:04:55 - 00:05:21 (26 sec),"Thank you, John. [Applause] Oxford. Oxford John. [Laughs] Great. Congressman Ralph Abraham. Thank you, Congressman. Where are you? Congressman? [Applause] Great job you do. He does a great job. Congressman Garrett Graves. And you know Garrett. Thank you, Garrett. Good job. Young, strong, smart. [Applause] We got a lot of good politicians down here."
00:05:21 - 00:05:50 (29 sec),"And the legend from Louisiana -- a man who's got a lot of courage. He was playing second base and it didn't work out so well for him that day, but I have never seen anybody with more strength and really more courage than Steve Scalise. Steve Scalise. [Applause] He got hit hard. He got hit hard. He never even thought about quitting."
00:05:50 - 00:06:05 (15 sec),"He -- I was there the night, in his hospital. And they didn't think he was going to make it. And I looked at him; he wasn't looking too good, I have to tell you. This is the first time I'm telling you this, Steve; you weren't looking too sharp. And his wife loves him, because she was a mess. She had tears pouring down."
00:06:05 - 00:06:24 (19 sec),"I'll tell you a couple of these little facts. Your family loves you, Steve. But all of a sudden, he started making a little progress, a little more. Worked so hard. And then, a few months ago, he was in a baseball game. And it was the Republicans against the Democrats. He's playing second base. And he didn't have great mobility, to be honest."
00:06:24 - 00:06:44 (20 sec),"In other words, moving like a foot to his right, a foot to the left -- that was about it. And he gets the first pitch of the game. This is in a stadium, and a lot of people watching, and it's on television. And they put him at second base for one play. And the first hit is a smash -- ground ball -- hit at Steve."
00:06:44 - 00:07:02 (18 sec),"And I'm pretty good at this stuff; I look, I say, Oh, that's going right to second base. It went right in him -- right at him. He bent down, stopped that ball, threw it to first. The place went crazy. And he then walked off the field in great triumph. [Laughter and applause] Who could have done that but my Steve, right?"
00:07:02 - 00:07:22 (20 sec),"[Applause] That was incredible. That was incredible. He's a courageous guy. He's a great guy. He's also a really fine person. So, Steve Scalise -- what you've been through, Steve, is incredible. And congratulations. Incredible job. As you all know, there is currently a tremendous humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border."
00:07:22 - 00:07:41 (19 sec),"It's tremendous. It's been there for years. It's been there for decades. But because of what we're doing and because of how well our country is doing -- And please sit down. Please. I'm just looking -- and then the media -- the fake news -- they'll say, He got no standing ovations. You know why? Because everybody stayed standing."
00:07:41 - 00:08:11 (30 sec),"[Laughter] Wait until you see that. It's true. Oh, they'll do it. They'll figure something out. [Applause] That's true. [Applause] That's true. [Laughs] [Applause] That's true. They can figure it out. They can take the best thing -- I go home, I say, Darling, I did such a great job. Wait until you see the news tomorrow on something. [Laughter] North Korea, China."
00:08:11 - 00:08:26 (16 sec),"We're doing great in the trade deal. China -- this, that. They can make anything you do look bad. But I was watching as you're standing. And I said, You know, if they sit, it's probably better for me, because every once in a while, they'll stand. [Laughter] The other way, they'll say, The crowd did not appreciate him."
00:08:26 - 00:08:49 (22 sec),"They didn't give him one standing ovation. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you very much. Women and children are being ruthlessly exploited at our southern border by vicious coyotes -- who would think of this? Human traffickers. Now, when you hear the words human traffickers, you think about 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago."
00:08:49 - 00:09:14 (25 sec),"You wouldn't think it's worse today in the world -- this is a world problem -- than it's ever been. And the reason it's worse is because of the Internet. They target young women. They target young children -- the Internet. And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped -- their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape."
00:09:14 - 00:09:32 (18 sec),"They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the backseat of cars and vans, and they go -- they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that. They come in through our border, where we don't have any barriers or walls."
00:09:32 - 00:09:54 (23 sec),"And they drive right in and they have no problems. And we'll get that stopped. We're going to have a wall. We're going to have a barrier. We're going to have something that's going to be very strong. [Applause] One of the most important things. And I've built a lot of wall. You saw it the other day. They kept saying, You didn't build wall. I said, I built wall. So I actually decided I'd better put a picture for you to see."
00:09:54 - 00:10:22 (28 sec),"But we built a lot more than that. And we renovated a lot of pretty good stuff that we made good again. It was in very bad shape. But we've done a lot. We want to finish it because, you know, you can't have openings. Because if you have an opening, they go here and they just sort of go over this way. They find the open spot, they come in. And we have to build -- what we have to build -- probably a total of 550 miles including the renovations."
00:10:22 - 00:10:43 (21 sec),"And we've done a lot of work. People don't talk about it. I don't talk about it because, until we're finished, the big thing is we have to get it done. And we've had great support from John, your senator; Bill, your senator; from everybody. We've had tremendous -- Steve is working hard in the House. Your congressmen are working really hard."
00:10:43 - 00:11:07 (23 sec),"Really hard. Because it's common sense. What we're talking about is common sense. Last month alone, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought across our borders. Twenty thousand. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the journey up from Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador. Think of that. Think of that."
00:11:07 - 00:11:37 (31 sec),"Hard to believe. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are being smuggled across the border. Most of the drugs coming into our country come in through the southern border -- and much of it comes through areas that are not your portals -- including meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl. Heroin alone, if you look at the heroin epidemic -- it's an epidemic -- heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week."
00:11:37 - 00:11:58 (21 sec),And 90 percent of it -- at least -- crosses our southern border. It comes in through our southern border. And I've spent a lot of time with Secret Service and with Border Patrol and ICE -- incredible people -- and they show me the methods that they use -- how they hide it. They put it in hubcaps. They put it in engines.
00:11:58 - 00:12:22 (24 sec),"They put it in areas you wouldn't believe. They're brilliant, in many ways. They're brilliant. You wouldn't even think of what they do to get things in. And we can stop it. But we can't stop it if we're going to play politics. And the numbers you're talking about are peanuts compared -- you'll make the money back numerous times a year."
00:12:22 - 00:13:05 (43 sec),"In 2017, drugs killed over 70,000 of our fellow citizens -- think of that, that's like a football stadium loaded up -- and imposed costs on our society in excess of $700 billion dollars. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested 266,000 illegal aliens -- think of that -- with criminal records, including 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent murders or killings."
00:13:05 - 00:13:29 (24 sec),"The crisis of illegal immigration impacts all Americans -- threatening public safety, overwhelming public resources, straining our local schools and hospitals, undermining U.S. workers, and claiming countless innocent lives. And I will tell you, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally."
00:13:29 - 00:14:05 (36 sec),"They have to come in through a process. [Applause] Thank you. As President, the defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty. And this is the defense of our nation, just like we prepare for other nations that you think more traditionally is what that sentence refers to. When it comes to keeping the American people safe, I will never, ever back down."
00:14:05 - 00:14:22 (17 sec),"I didn't need this fight. This is a rough fight. We're dealing against people who think that if they can stop me from building the wall -- again, we've already done a lot of work -- but they think that's a good thing for 2020, because they're not going to win. They think if they can stop me from building the wall, that's good."
00:14:22 - 00:14:40 (17 sec),"This is the reason why they don't want the wall built -- because they all know it works. They all approved it numerous times. I mean, Chuck Schumer had his hand up every time this would come up. The senators know this. They're only doing this because of the 2020 election because I said I'll build the wall and I'm going to build the wall."
00:14:40 - 00:15:17 (38 sec),"And it's only one of many things that I promised. I mean, if you look at -- [Applause] -- I got you the biggest tax cut -- beyond the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. ANWR, getting rid of the individual mandate, the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country -- and we're going further. [Applause] That might be the biggest reason that our country is doing so much better than other countries and why we're doing so well."
00:15:17 - 00:15:36 (19 sec),"But they view this as a political thing because this was one of the big things I -- I said, We're going to do tax cuts. We're going to do regulation. We're going to doâ¦ And, you know, we've done most of what we said. One of the -- that's a lot of news back there. One of the folks back there said that He's actually done more than he promised. It's true."
00:15:36 - 00:15:58 (22 sec),"I have actually done more than I promised. We've done a lot. Even with the veterans. [Applause] A lot of veterans in Louisiana. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Choice approved, which is pretty amazing. They've been trying to get that for years and years -- decades and decades. And we got Accountability -- VA Accountability."
00:15:58 - 00:16:21 (23 sec),"When you had somebody treating our veterans horribly, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't fire them -- whether it's unions, or whether it's civil service, or whatever it may have been. But for decades and decades, somebody could do anything they wanted. They can steal, they could abuse our veterans, they can be sadists, they can do whatever they want and you couldn't fire them."
00:16:21 - 00:16:47 (26 sec),"And I got Accountability approved. Everyone said you couldn't get that -- too much power against it. We got it done, and now we can say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here. We don't want you taking care of our veterans. [Applause] That was a big thing. A lot of help from those people. So we got a lot done, but they view the wall as being a big item that, if I don't do it, you know, it's a negative."
00:16:47 - 00:17:14 (27 sec),"It's a negative. And I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm doing it because we have to do it. It's common sense. We have to do it. If you look at the caravans coming up, if you look at what's going on -- you take a look. If we didn't have some of those walls -- the military has been incredible. They came up and they built some barriers -- they kept thousands and thousands of people from overrunning various sections of our country."
00:17:14 - 00:17:39 (25 sec),"We've done a great job at the border, but we need that extra -- we need that barrier because you can't do this. You can have all the people you want dressed in military. You can have ICE. You can have Border Patrol. If you don't have that barrier, there's not a thing you can do. You know, they all say, We like technology. I like technology, too."
00:17:39 - 00:18:08 (29 sec),"But we can have all the drones in the world flying around; we can have all the sensors in the world, but if you don't have a strong steel or concrete barrier, there's no way you're going to stop these people from rushing. Last week -- and we have no idea who they are. And you got some -- I'm sure -- very good ones, but you got some real bad ones."
00:18:08 - 00:18:52 (44 sec),"Last week, I traveled to McAllen, Texas to tour the border and meet with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. These great patriots made clear what they need from Congress and to end this terrible crisis. And we will end it. We will end it. You know, when we have proper security, people aren't going to come, except for the people we want to come because we want to take people in to help our farmers, et cetera."
00:18:52 - 00:19:09 (17 sec),"Very important. We're going to make that actually easier for them -- to help the farmers. [Applause] Because you need these people. No, you need these people. We're going to make it easier. [Applause] I mean, I'm glad I told you that because, you know, look, you're in that business and a lot of people don't understand this."
00:19:09 - 00:19:29 (20 sec),"You need those -- you need people to help you with the farms. And I'm not going to rule that out. I'm going to make that easier for them to come in and to work the farms. You've had some people for 20, 25 years. They're incredible. Then they go home and they can't get back in. That's not going to happen."
00:19:29 - 00:19:59 (30 sec),"But we're keeping the wrong ones out, okay? We don't want the wrong ones coming into our country. And, for that, it's going to be almost impossible to get in. For the people that work the farms, that have been here, that have gone through this very short but good process, that are going to help our country, it's going to be easier for them to get in that what they have to go through now."
00:19:59 - 00:20:26 (26 sec),"So just remember that. [Applause] I know a lot about the farming world. And, if I don't, Sonny teaches me. They explained that there is no substitute for a wall -- these are the ICE people and the Border Patrol people -- or a physical barrier. There is no substitute. Where a barrier exists, illegal crossings plummet dramatically."
00:20:26 - 00:20:56 (30 sec),"In El Paso, they had -- it was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. A wall was put up. It went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight -- overnight. Does that tell you something? [Applause] And I can give you many examples of that."
00:20:56 - 00:21:22 (26 sec),"They say it's medieval -- a wall. It is medieval. So is a wheel. I always say a wheel. But every time I look out, they all have wheels. You know, they may have gone electric and they may have done lots of different things, but every car I've seen still has wheels. [Laughter] Wheels work and walls work."
00:21:22 - 00:21:41 (18 sec),"You know, there's some things you can't beat. [Applause] That's why we've asked Congress to fund a steel barrier, or whatever you want to call it. This barrier will stop illegal activity, while directing lawful trade, travel, and commerce to our ports of entry. These ports are America's doors, but doors only work when you have strength."
00:21:41 - 00:22:00 (20 sec),"We need strength. Right now, we have weakness. They're forming a new caravan in Honduras. Honduras is not helping us. They could stop it. We send them hundreds of millions of dollars a year -- El Salvador, Honduras, and other places -- Guatemala -- hundreds of millions, but they don't help us, like so many nations."
00:22:00 - 00:22:22 (22 sec),We help them; they don't help us. We don't even get their votes often when we need their vote in the United Nations. They don't vote for us. Why? Because the wrong people are asking them. So those days are over. So I said just before I came -- we're looking at a whole plan -- why are we sending them money if they're allowing caravans to form right in the middle of their cities?
00:22:22 - 00:22:46 (24 sec),"Why are we sending them money? [Applause] A lot of changes have been made in this country in less than two years, I will tell you that. A lot of changes. And really good changes -- changes that people like you, with common sense and smarts, fully understand. And that's why we're liking where we are and the country is changing very rapidly for the better."
00:22:46 - 00:23:12 (27 sec),"As part of our overall border security plan, we have also asked Congress to approve cutting-edge technology to detect drugs. There's incredible technology today. So when these cars do come in through the ports of entry, you have technology today that's so incredible. We don't use it. We don't have it because our leaders decided not to spend the money."
00:23:12 - 00:23:35 (23 sec),"Well, you make it back every month -- probably more than that -- because the drugs coming through the southern border are destroying the fabric of our country. It's so bad. It's so bad. [Applause] So we have to stop it. This technology is incredible. To fund more agents -- we're putting that high on the list -- officers, beds."
00:23:35 - 00:24:06 (31 sec),"Believe it or not, we're one of the only countries -- I say one, because every time I say something else they'll say, Oh, well, there was a country that also did it. Somebody comes into our country, they touch one foot on the ground, and we have to catch them. It's called, catch. We then take their names and we bring them to a court -- can you believe this?"
00:24:06 - 00:24:24 (17 sec),"-- and we release them. But, see, we're trying to do catch-and-hold. Catch-and-not-release. But you have to release. So we release. And they go into our country, and then you announce -- these are the laws -- then you say, Come back in three years for your trial. Tell me, what percentage of people come back?"
00:24:24 - 00:24:43 (19 sec),"Would you say 100 percent? No, you're a little off. Like, how about 2 percent? [Laughter] And those people, you almost don't want, because they cannot be very smart. [Laughter] Two percent. Two percent. Two percent come back. Those two percent are not going to make America great again, that I can tell you."
00:24:43 - 00:25:02 (19 sec),"[Laughter and applause] Crazy. So we have that and we have chain migration, where somebody comes in, and then his mother comes in, his father comes in, his grandmother comes in, his uncle comes in, his cousins come in. We had a guy -- a radical Islamic terrorist in New York -- area I know very well -- driving down the West Side highway."
00:25:02 - 00:25:23 (21 sec),"Beautiful -- Hudson River to his right. We built this gorgeous park all along the river. It's gorgeous. People are running; they're in great shape. We ought to all -- some of these guys in the front row, they should do it with me. We could run. [Laughter] Some of my friends over there. Sonny -- maybe Sonny and I will go take a jog."
00:25:23 - 00:25:43 (20 sec),"[Laughter] But you know what? I'll tell you, these are people that are great people, and they're running and they keep -- and this horrible person, going down 60 miles an hour down a highway, decides, Oh, that's nice. We'll make a right turn. Hits a whole group of people purposely, screaming all sorts of things that they scream."
00:25:43 - 00:26:11 (28 sec),"And 8 people died; 12 or 13 were injured. Nobody talks about the injured. You know, some of the injured lost legs, lost arms. You know, this is -- they say, Oh, well, 12 were injured. You know, like, injured -- you think, like, a headache. No, no. They lost arms. They lost legs. One lost two legs. So 12 were horribly injured."
00:26:11 - 00:26:32 (21 sec),"And he's allowed to have his family come here. So they checked, and they said that he had about 22 people came in -- chain migration. In other words, because he's here -- so a whole group of people come in. And we don't want that. We have another one -- the lottery. The lottery. We take people from countries through the lottery."
00:26:32 - 00:26:59 (27 sec),"Now, this is common sense. Do you think the country is giving us their finest? No, they're not. No, they're not. They're giving us the opposite of their finest. And we have a lottery system. Oh, let's pick him out. Oh, wonderful. Doesn't work out too well, this lottery system. But this is the law. This was passed by Democrats and, I guess, Republicans."
00:26:59 - 00:27:18 (19 sec),"You know, maybe they voted -- who knows? But these are laws that have to be changed. These are -- these are sick, demented laws that we have to change. We can't allow this to keep happening. The people that are sent to our country are not the people that we want. They come in through the lottery. They come in through chain migration."
00:27:18 - 00:27:50 (31 sec),"Think of it: This man that killed 8 people and so badly injured 12, they say he's about 22 relatives coming in that are here. And take a look at how well his relatives are doing. It's not a good picture. So we have to change our laws. It's very hard because the Democrats don't want to change them. But I hope that common sense and people like this can persuade them, because it's gotten to a point where you have to. We really have no choice."
00:27:50 - 00:28:16 (27 sec),"And we're fighting hard. We're fighting very hard for you. We're making a lot of progress, I can tell you that. [Applause] Here with us today is Jim Chilton from Arizona. Jim's ranch runs along the U.S-Mexico border. The deadly -- very deadly -- Sinaloa cartel, one of the most vicious drug cartels anywhere in the world, runs a major drug trafficking route right through Jim's ranch."
00:28:16 - 00:28:36 (19 sec),"Many of these routes used to run through San Diego until the wall was built by us, by me. [Applause] Sorry about that, Jim. [Laughs] I think Jim has just got angry at me; he just heard that. Sorry, Jim. Because now, what they did, they went to Jim's ranch. I think I cost him a lot of money. Maybe he won't stand up after all."
00:28:36 - 00:29:35 (60 sec),"But it's a very sad situation. In the last two years, the cameras on Jim's ranch have captured roughly 1,000 pictures of major drug packers, they call them. For years, these criminals have damaged Jim's property, injured his livestock, and started dozens of fire, which Jim estimates cost more than $2 million dollars in 2017 alone."
00:29:35 - 00:30:09 (33 sec),"Last June, a Border Patrol agent was checking sensors on the Clinton's -- and Chilton's ranch when he was shot multiple times by these sinister drug traffickers. Multiple times. And they don't even think about. By the way, they shoot -- it's not like, Oh, gee, I committed a terrible thing. They don't even think about it. They don't even think."
00:30:09 - 00:30:21 (13 sec),"They wake up the next morning and they couldn't care less. As Jim has said, Every time I leave the ranch, my wife doesn't know whether I'll ever return. I would like to ask Jim to come up and say a few words. Jim, please come up. Thank you. [Applause]"
00:30:21 - 00:30:31 (9 sec),"Mr. President, we need a wall. [Applause] I would say we need a wall all around all the length of the border. We've got to stop the drug packers bringing drugs in to poison our people. And I would say to Speaker Pelosi, walls are not immoral. [Applause]"
00:30:31 - 00:30:50 (19 sec),"In fact, I've traveled around the world, and the biggest wall I've ever seen is around the Vatican. Now, you can't tell me that the wonderful priest and officials of the Roman Catholic Church, including the Pope, are immoral. They have a wall. Why can't we? [Applause]"
00:30:50 - 00:31:11 (20 sec),"Thank you, Jim. [Applause] Thank you, Jim. And I'm sorry for your problems, but we'll get it straightened out. The government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: The Democrats will not fund border security, our safety, our national security. People come from many countries."
00:31:11 - 00:31:34 (23 sec),"When I was at the wall the other day, Border Patrol said they have 150 people they caught that day who weren't from Mexico. I said, That's a strange statement. They said, No, these are the people that weren't from Mexico. And I was surprised. Three were from Pakistan. Four were from another Mid-East -- two Mid-East countries."
00:31:34 - 00:32:00 (26 sec),"And many of them were from other countries, including China -- countries all over the world. A hundred and fifty of the people, as he said, were not from Mexico. Now, they caught many, many more, but that's a 150 people coming from companies that -- you know, really, countries that you wouldn't believe. They will not approve the measures we need to keep America safe -- the Democrats."
00:32:00 - 00:32:18 (18 sec),"We can't do that. We can't do that because this is of paramount importance to our country. And again, I could take it nice and easy. I could enjoy myself. I could relax. I've been in the White House because I think it's very important to be there. And other people went on a nice, wonderful vacation over the weekend."
00:32:18 - 00:32:44 (26 sec),They had a great time. I would have loved to have been with them. I didn't like the look of it. I would have loved to have been with them. But we have a very big problem. This should have been done by other Presidents. Just like the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem should have been done -- it was promised by many other Presidents. [Applause]
00:32:44 - 00:33:07 (23 sec),"Just like we're doing the job on North Korea, just like we're doing the job with China -- we're getting it done. We're getting it done. We're getting it all done. But it would have been nice if other administrations were able to do it. But we have to do the border. In the meantime, the USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown."
00:33:07 - 00:33:30 (23 sec),"We thank you for your support and patriotism. And we fight to defend our nation. We are fighting very hard to defend our nation. And many people that aren't getting a payment, that aren't being paid, have let us know in the strongest of terms -- a big amount -- they said, Sir, what you're doing is of paramount importance."
00:33:30 - 00:33:56 (25 sec),"Do the job right, and we are with you, 100 percent. You'd be surprised at how many people have said that. And it's not easy for them, but it's a lot of people. [Applause] So I'm asking all of our citizens to call your Democrat lawmakers and ask them to pass a bill that secures our border, protects our country, and now reopens our government."
00:33:56 - 00:34:17 (21 sec),"Because as soon as they do that, we reopen our government. You would think that would be a very simple task. On every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers. We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible. I saw what was going on in Canada -- the way you were treated."
00:34:17 - 00:34:41 (24 sec),"Horrible. And they treated their farmers great. Great. We changed it with the new trade deal we made with Mexico and Canada. And opening up new markets to export -- many, many new markets are being opened up. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And the farmers got hit probably as hard as anybody."
00:34:41 - 00:35:18 (37 sec),"We're reversing harmful federal intrusion. And to keep family farms in the family, we have virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Small business owners and corporations and others -- small business -- it was a terrible thing that was happening, where your parents -- you love your parents -- they're farmers -- they love their farms."
00:35:18 - 00:35:34 (15 sec),"Everybody loves their farm. The kids -- they want to grow up on the farm. They want to someday run the farm, own the farm. And they couldn't because they had very large estate taxes to pay. So they go out and borrow money, and then it turned a little bit bad. And all of the sudden, they'd end up losing the farm because they had to pay the estate tax."
00:35:34 - 00:35:53 (19 sec),"We got rid of it, folks. So if you love your children, you'll like me. If you don't love your children, and you weren't going to leave the farm to them, it probably doesn't matter too much, okay? [Laughter] Does anybody here not love their children? Wow, that's a lot of people -- not one? Okay, you don't want to say."
00:35:53 - 00:36:09 (15 sec),"That's all right. [Laughter] That's like a lot of the people that went to the polls; they voted for Trump. [Laughter] They said, We don't want to talk about it. Then we won. We won two years ago. In November, we won. [Applause] And everybody is trying -- they're still trying to figure out what happened."
00:36:09 - 00:36:37 (28 sec),"We don't have to talk about it. We know what we're doing. We're ensuring that ethanol remains a vital part of America's energy future, with E-15. And we're making it available year round -- all 12 months. That was a big, big difference for the farmers. [Applause] Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst -- your senators -- a lot of great people were very strong on that."
00:36:37 - 00:37:00 (23 sec),"And it also creates additional, because, if you noticed, I think we saw $1.75 for gasoline today, coming in. I like to do that; I'm one of these guys. [Applause] I'm riding in this incredible car, and I'm driving, and I'm looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas. How many other Presidents -- you think Hillary Clinton would have done that?"
00:37:00 - 00:37:20 (20 sec),"I don't think so. I don't think so. [Laughter and applause] I'm in the Beast -- the world's most expensive car. It's like being in an army tank that goes 50 miles an hour, right? I'm in the Beast and I'm looking at gas stations. I say, Fellas, slow up. I can't see. [Laughter] They say, $1.75. That didn't happen by accident, folks."
00:37:20 - 00:37:41 (21 sec),"That didn't happen by accident. People think it does; it doesn't. Nothing happens -- very few, very little happens by accident. Nobody else would have done what we did for the farmers, with the estate taxes and so many other things. In the two years before my election, agricultural exports dropped by nearly $23 billion."
00:37:41 - 00:38:13 (32 sec),"Remember that: Before I got here, it was heading south. A lot of people say, Oh, gee, how are we doing? It was going bad. If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office. They were less. Now they're up nearly $14 billion. In December, just a few days before Christmas, I was proud to sign the Farm Bill."
00:38:13 - 00:38:49 (36 sec),"We got it done. That wasn't easy either. [Applause] That was not easy. Senators, Congressmen, thank you. That group did it. [Applause] That was not an easy one, John and Bill, was it, huh? That wasn't easy. But we got it done. The first to be passed, on time, in over 30 years. Got it done. And I've authorized Secretary Perdue to be strong on work rules for the Food Stamp program, through regulations allowed by the bill."
00:38:49 - 00:39:12 (24 sec),"So I know you have a great Secretary. He'll do what's right. The Farm Bill delivers for our farmers on a wide range of key priorities. On critical farm programs, such as crop insurance, you will have the support you need to plan for the future. It increases the amount farmers can borrow so you can expand and improve your businesses."
00:39:12 - 00:39:37 (25 sec),"It also secures the $600 million commitment we made to build a modern, effective, rural broadband across America's heartland. You're not well serviced. [Applause] That's something the great, great middle part of our country has been complaining about for a long time. You're not properly serviced. You will be now."
00:39:37 - 00:40:08 (31 sec),"You will be now. That bill is a great bill for the farmer. Last year, when I spoke to you, we had just passed our historic tax cuts. Here with us today is Kalena Bruce from Stockton, Missouri. Kalena is a rancher, and also an accountant for local farmers. Under our new tax plan, which lowers rates for small businesses and doubles the tax child credit -- so important, that child tax credit."
00:40:08 - 00:40:30 (22 sec),"You know who fought for that? A young woman named Ivanka Trump. That's all she wanted. Dad? Dad? We have to get that passed, Dad. [Applause] I said, Okay, Ivanka. Okay. Okay. [Laughter] It turned out to be so popular. Kalena has seen that many families will save upwards of $4,000 in taxes this year alone."
00:40:30 - 00:40:54 (25 sec),"Kalena, I want to thank you and all of those incredible people that you represent. And just keep up the great work. Where is Kalena? Where is Kalena? She's around here someplace. Hi, Kalena. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. [Applause] We're also leading the most sweeping regulatory reform at any time in our history."
00:40:54 - 00:41:21 (27 sec),"The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled back almost $400 million in regulatory costs last year alone. And this year, they're projected to more than double those savings. We're saving farmers and ranchers from one of the most ridiculous regulations ever imposed on anybody in our nation: the Waters of the United States rule."
00:41:21 - 00:41:59 (38 sec),"[Applause] Disaster -- other than the title. Such a beautiful title. It was a total kill on farmers, on builders, on everybody. It was a total kill. Sounds so nice. In fact, I looked at John Kennedy, when I signed that. I said, John, I'm going to get killed for this one. Because what we did was take something -- the Water of the United States. How beautiful is that?"
00:41:59 - 00:42:19 (20 sec),"And yet, everything inside was a total kill on you -- and other businesses, by the way. [Applause] And we didn't get killed, did we, John, huh? We didn't. They love it. So many people have come -- and, you know, the time when I signed that bill, I had ranchers, farmers, and some homebuilders behind me. And these are tough people."
00:42:19 - 00:42:38 (19 sec),"They were strong, tough men and women. And half of them were crying because we basically -- our government stole their property. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't build. They couldn't do anything. They were crying. I said, What are you crying about? The one guy -- I don't think he cried in his whole life."
00:42:38 - 00:43:00 (22 sec),"I don't think he cried when we was a baby. He was crying. [Laughter] He said, Sir, you gave me back my life. You gave me back my property. They took it away -- environmentally, took it away. And you're going to do the right thing. In the audience today is Val Wagner from Monango, North Dakota. Val -- [Applause]. [Laughs] It's a good place."
00:43:00 - 00:43:22 (22 sec),"[Laughter] You have a great new senator, by the way. [Applause] A great new senator. Really great. Val and her husband would love to expand their farm for their four boys, but under the Waters of the United States rule, they would have to pay tens and of thousands of dollars in fines because of the prairie potholes on their land."
00:43:22 - 00:43:48 (25 sec),"Do you all know what prairie potholes are? Yes, you do. I don't, but it sounds bad. [Laughter] To Val and to every farmer, we are going to keep federal regulators out of your -- out of your tanks -- your stock tanks, your drainage ditches, your puddles, and your ponds. And you know exactly what I'm talking about."
00:43:48 - 00:44:21 (34 sec),"You could have a pond -- a little pond -- and they consider it a lake. [Applause] And you're regulated as though it were a lake. We're going to get government off your backs so you can earn a living and support your families doing what you love. And I know what you love. Farmers love what they're doing. [Applause] We also passed legislation to rebuild our water infrastructure, including our nation's inland waterways, which carry more than 60 percent of our agricultural products."
00:44:21 - 00:44:48 (27 sec),"We are replacing one-sided, unfair trade deals. We have so many nations -- it's a one-sided deal. With China, every year, for many years, we're losing $375 billion -- not million, billion dollars. We're working on that very strongly. You see what's going on. We're doing very well. We have the European Union -- they don't treat us right."
00:44:48 - 00:45:05 (17 sec),"They treat our farmers terribly. You can hardly sell into the -- they have barriers and they have tariffs that are massive. But with the farmers, they don't want your product. We're working with them; they have to treat us fairly. We're losing $151 billion a year with the European Union. It sounds so nice, right?"
00:45:05 - 00:45:21 (17 sec),"The European Union. And then the press gets angry. They say, Donald Trump is not treating the European Union fairly. Well, that's because they're not treating us fairly, folks. I want to be nice. In fact, they said my poll numbers are very bad in Europe. I said, They should be. [Laughter] No, seriously."
00:45:21 - 00:45:59 (38 sec),"They said, When he started off, he had 87 percent. That means you could be the king of any country. Now, they [Inaudible] because I'm representing our country; I'm not representing those country -- you know, one of those [Inaudible]. [Applause] True. It's true. They said, His poll numbers have tanked. And I said, Oh, damn it. What's going on? Damn it. And then I said, Oh, it's in Europe."
00:45:59 - 00:46:24 (25 sec),"That's okay. [Laughter] No, we get along well with them. And they're a lot of great people and great leaders. But, look, I'm not blaming them. I don't blame China. I mean, China -- $375 billion a year, we lose. It's really more than that, but that's like the conservative number. I think it's $504 [Billion]. But I'm giving you conservative because I don't want to be criticized for using wrong numbers, right?"
00:46:24 - 00:46:43 (19 sec),"[Laughter] But I don't blame China. I was in China making a speech, and President Xi -- who's a friend of -- great guy. But he represent them; I represent us. And he's sitting over here. And I'm talking to this massive crowd of people. And I'm talking about how China is bad, bad, bad. And I'm saying, Boy, this is -- this could be dangerous. [Laughter] I'm in China."
00:46:43 - 00:47:14 (30 sec),"I'm in Beijing doing this. And I'm saying, I don't like this. But I looked at him, and I realized -- actually during that speech -- it's not his fault or their fault. It's our fault for allowing that to happen. It's our leaders' fault. [Applause] Over the last 15 years, we've seen a continual decline in the U.S. share of agricultural trade all throughout the world."
00:47:14 - 00:47:30 (16 sec),"You know that. It was all going in the wrong direction. It's changing now. Wait until you see what happens. If we do the right deal with China, you're talking about massive -- they're already backordering, right? They're already back. I told them. I said, You got to start ordering. You're going to order. They're going to order, and they've already started."
00:47:30 - 00:48:05 (35 sec),"We're turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American farmers, ranchers, and, in fact, put America first. That's what I'm interested in: America first. [Applause] We just opened Argentina to American pork exports -- pork -- for the first time in a quarter of a century. They needed something; I said, You have to open it up to pork. And they said, Okay. I said, Why didn't you do it before? They said, Nobody ever asked us. [Laughter] A lot of it is that."
00:48:05 - 00:48:30 (24 sec),"You would be amazed. Nobody ever asks. India and Morocco have both opened their markets to our poultry exports. We do so much for them. It's incredible. Japan opened its market to U.S. exports of potatoes from Idaho -- [Applause] -- and lamb from the great state of Texas, yes. No, they just opened up. We asked them."
00:48:30 - 00:48:51 (22 sec),"We said, You got to open up. Sorry. U.S. beef has been shipped to Brazil for the first time since 2003. They're going to have a great new leader. They say he's the Donald Trump of South America. Do you believe that? [Applause] And he's happy with that. If he wasn't, I wouldn't like the country so much."
00:48:51 - 00:49:21 (30 sec),"But I like him. And we opened China to American beef for the first time in many, many years. We've taken -- [Applause]. You know that. But that was before the trade deal. Don't even worry about it. This is -- that's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. We've taken the toughest-ever actions to confront China's unfair trade practices that hurt American farmers and ranchers."
00:49:21 - 00:49:59 (38 sec),"This includes China's theft of trade secrets from American agri-business. I couldn't believe how complicated your business is -- with the seeds and the genetic farming. It's incredible. People don't know this. But your secrets were being stolen by China, and, in all fairness, other countries. We want a fair deal for American farmers -- removing China's arbitrary bans on agricultural imports, safeguarding our intellectual property, and providing fair market access to all American producers."
00:49:59 - 00:50:35 (36 sec),"We have also made history by finalizing an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the USMCA. A whole different world. A whole different world. [Applause] NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made by a country. It killed our country. This landmark trade deal will increase exports of wheat from Montana, dairy from Wisconsin, chicken from Georgia, and products from farmers and ranchers all across our country."
00:50:35 - 00:51:03 (28 sec),"As part of the USMCA, Canada agreed to give fair treatment to American wheat farmers. They will now grade American wheat just like they grade their own wheat. [Applause] Which, to me, doesn't mean much, but, to farmers, it means a lot. That's what they tell me. I said, What can we do? They said that would be a big thing -- on wheat."
00:51:03 - 00:51:25 (22 sec),"Even the NFL -- you know, the NFL, for many years, was having a hard time with Canada, having to do with the Super Bowl. I heard about it, and I asked about it. And it was a lot of money, but it was tiny compared to the overall deal with Canada and with Mexico. So, as one of the things, I said, You got to treat the NFL fairly. You know, it's a great American company."
00:51:25 - 00:51:45 (20 sec),"And we had the dispute over the National Anthem, and that seems to have worked out properly, which is great, which I give them credit for now. And I said, Listen, when you go to Canada, you're going to ask for this thing because they're not treating our company right. Any company -- I don't care, but that was the NFL."
00:51:45 - 00:52:23 (38 sec),"A big company. A great American company. I said, You're not treating them well. We asked for it; in one minute, we solved a problem that they've been working on for many years. Total success. And they called up, and they thanked me. But it's something that I want to do for American companies. It's easy, it's short, it took a few minutes, and we got it. They were fighting for years."
00:52:23 - 00:52:59 (36 sec),"Canada also agreed to end unfair trade practices that hurt American dairy exports. Also here today are Cris and Gary Peterson, and their son Ben and daughter-in-law Nicki. More than 140 years ago, Gary's great-grandmother began their farm in a tremendous state -- I love this state. Remember when they say, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin? That state hasn't been won by a Republican in so long."
00:52:59 - 00:53:24 (25 sec),"Bill, you don't remember any wins there, right? That was a long time ago. That was even before your time. Right, Bill? A long time. And they said, Donald Trumpâ¦ Remember that? Was that a great evening or what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. [Applause] We love Wisconsin. Today, the Petersons have more than 900 dairy cows."
00:53:24 - 00:53:52 (28 sec),"Like so many of our great farmers, the Petersons have faced a number of threats to their farm and to their entire way of life. For years, NAFTA made it difficult for dairy farmers like the Petersons to export milk, ice cream, cheese, and many other dairy products. Under the USMCA, the Peterson family will finally have the level playing field that they should have had for many years."
00:53:52 - 00:54:17 (25 sec),"They have it now. Together, we urge Congress to support American agriculture, stand up for American workers, and hopefully they will approve the USMCA quite quickly. You know, the one thing I worry about -- it's almost -- no matter how good something is, they might not want to approve it, but they'll approve it. This one -- I think it's going to be very tough for them not."
00:54:17 - 00:54:43 (26 sec),"But I think that -- I hear it's in very good shape. And it replaces something that has been so bad to our country. This is a great deal. As we reverse the damage of decades of unfair trade, we are also providing up to $12 billion in relief to protect our farmers from unfair foreign retaliation. And you saw that recently with Sonny Perdue, where we were helping out during a very unfair period of time when people were actually trying to affect our election."
00:54:43 - 00:55:05 (22 sec),"Nobody brings that up. In this case, it was China. I haven't heard too much about that. Have you heard anything about that? But they were. And we helped our farmers out. No one understands better than our great farmers that the tough choices we make today reap rewards for centuries to come. More than 200 years ago, this very city was at the center of America's negotiations during the legendary Louisiana Purchase."
00:55:05 - 00:55:38 (32 sec),"No one knew how it would all turn out, but President Thomas Jefferson acted decisively for the American people. After months of negotiations, we got what no one ever imagined possible. Not only did we gain New Orleans, we doubled the size of the United States; we secured new parts and ports -- new parts of the map and globe that we never thought, and new ports, very importantly for American agriculture; and we made our nation the greatest farm country on God's Earth."
00:55:38 - 00:56:21 (43 sec),"And it remains that. And it's now, for the first time in a long time, getting better. [Applause] Our nation was founded, settled, and built by farmers. [Applause] From the fields of Pennsylvania to the hills of Tennessee -- [Applause]; from the plains of Missouri -- [Applause] -- to the Big Sky of Montana -- [Applause]; and from the marshes of Florida -- [Applause] -- to the fertile valley of California -- [Applause] -- farmers have always led the way."
00:56:21 - 00:56:58 (37 sec),"[Applause] The American farmer embodies the timeless values of America. You believe in hard work and self-reliance. You follow the rules, obey our laws, and respect our great American flag. [Applause] You support our communities, raise loving families, teach your children right from wrong, and you are always loyal to this magnificent nation that we so love."
00:56:58 - 00:57:30 (32 sec),"Now you have a government that is loyal to you, finally, in return. [Applause] Because we know that government's first duty is to our own citizens. We are fighting for the American farmer, and we are fighting for the American Dream, and for products made and grown with pride right here in the USA. It's what we're fighting for."
00:57:30 - 00:58:00 (30 sec),"[Applause] We are defending a cherished legacy, and we are preserving a beautiful way of life passed down from mothers and fathers to sons and daughters, from generation to generation. You are the keepers of this noble tradition. You are the guardians of this majestic heritage. We are standing up for the men and women who work the fields, till the soil, and harvest the land."
00:58:00 - 00:58:48 (48 sec),"We are protecting your rights, your freedoms, and our glorious Constitution. And we are doing it all with love in our hearts, joy in our souls, and trust in our God. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. To all of the farmers here today and across our country, the greatest harvest is yet to come. The future for America's farmers is bigger, better, bolder, and brighter than ever before."
00:58:48 - 00:59:02 (14 sec),"I just want to thank you all for being here. I'm so honored to have had this kind of a turnout, this kind of a record. I want to thank the American Farm Bureau for the incredible job they do."
00:59:02 - 00:59:26 (24 sec),"I'm proud to be a great friend of the farmer, of the rancher, of the people who so nobly do what you do. God bless you all. God bless our farmers. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. [Applause]"
00:00:00 - 00:00:29 (29 sec),"My fellow Americans. Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country."
00:00:29 - 00:01:02 (33 sec),"America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources, and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl."
00:01:02 - 00:01:40 (38 sec),"Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings."
00:01:40 - 00:02:09 (29 sec),"Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now. This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase."
00:02:09 - 00:02:34 (25 sec),These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims -- by far -- of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.
00:02:34 - 00:03:03 (29 sec),"This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security."
00:03:03 - 00:03:38 (35 sec),"These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission, and keep America safe -- in fact, safer than ever before. The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy."
00:03:38 - 00:04:10 (32 sec),"Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes, so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home. Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier."
00:04:10 - 00:04:44 (35 sec),"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress."
00:04:44 - 00:05:10 (25 sec),"The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They change their mind only after I was elected president."
00:05:10 - 00:05:37 (28 sec),"Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security."
00:05:37 - 00:06:05 (27 sec),My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.
00:06:05 - 00:06:34 (29 sec),"Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security. Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside."
00:06:34 - 00:07:00 (26 sec),The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized. America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border.
00:07:00 - 00:07:28 (27 sec),"The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history."
00:07:28 - 00:08:03 (35 sec),"In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors, were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl. Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration."
00:08:03 - 00:08:48 (45 sec),"I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? For those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered, and totally broken."
00:08:48 - 00:09:20 (32 sec),"To every member of Congress: pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen: call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve."
00:09:20 - 00:09:35 (14 sec),"When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country, and that is what I will always do, so help me God. Thank you, and good night."
00:00:00 - 00:01:27 (87 sec),"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation."
00:01:27 - 00:02:19 (53 sec),"The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican Agenda or a Democrat Agenda. It is the agenda of the American People. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first."
00:02:19 - 00:03:13 (54 sec),"There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the Majesty of America's Mission, and the Power of American Pride."
00:03:13 - 00:03:58 (45 sec),"In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade -- the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6th, 1944, fifteen thousand young American men jumped from the sky and sixty thousand more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny."
00:03:58 - 00:05:21 (83 sec),"Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon."
00:05:21 - 00:06:39 (78 sec),"Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle-class standard of living for the entire world to see."
00:06:39 - 00:07:58 (80 sec),"Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this Great American Adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our Middle Class bigger and more prosperous than ever before."
00:07:58 - 00:08:50 (52 sec),"But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future."
00:08:50 - 00:09:41 (51 sec),"The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades."
00:09:41 - 00:10:12 (30 sec),"In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom -- a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started."
00:10:12 - 00:10:49 (37 sec),"Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
00:10:49 - 00:12:42 (113 sec),"Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history -- 157 million."
00:12:42 - 00:13:57 (75 sec),"We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty â and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try."
00:13:57 - 00:14:58 (61 sec),My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American Energy -- the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.
00:14:58 - 00:16:59 (121 sec),"And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is Strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before."
00:16:59 - 00:18:06 (67 sec),"On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone -- almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation."
00:18:06 - 00:19:02 (56 sec),"It just doesn't work that way. We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate -- some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country."
00:19:02 - 00:20:05 (63 sec),"Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans."
00:20:05 - 00:20:59 (55 sec),"And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking Criminal Justice Reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path."
00:20:59 - 00:21:58 (59 sec),"She had a big impact on that prison population -- and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing -- and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice's sentence -- when I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing -- Alice is here with us tonight."
00:21:58 - 00:23:20 (82 sec),"Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. Inspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community."
00:23:20 - 00:23:59 (39 sec),"The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, states across the country are following our lead. America is a nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses."
00:23:59 - 00:25:10 (71 sec),"Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of All Americans: welcome home. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis."
00:25:10 - 00:26:06 (56 sec),"Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our Southern Border. Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business."
00:26:06 - 00:26:46 (40 sec),"As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our Southern Border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught."
00:26:46 - 00:27:21 (35 sec),"This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our Southern Border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws."
00:27:21 - 00:28:33 (72 sec),"Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration."
00:28:33 - 00:29:24 (51 sec),"Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."
00:29:24 - 00:30:20 (57 sec),Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel. 1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
00:30:20 - 00:31:06 (45 sec),"Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our Southern Border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City."
00:31:06 - 00:31:42 (36 sec),"We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads and families -- no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured."
00:31:42 - 00:32:26 (44 sec),"Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison."
00:32:26 - 00:33:44 (78 sec),"To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings."
00:33:44 - 00:34:39 (55 sec),"We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking."
00:34:39 - 00:36:19 (101 sec),"Elvin says: ""If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job."" Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars. Special Agent Hernandez please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement -- and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our Southern Border."
00:36:19 - 00:37:11 (52 sec),"It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall."
00:37:11 - 00:38:01 (50 sec),"It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings."
00:38:01 - 00:39:13 (72 sec),"The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime -- one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe."
00:39:13 - 00:42:02 (169 sec),"As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before -- and exactly one century after Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than ever before."
00:42:02 - 00:42:37 (35 sec),"As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount -- reversing decades of calamitous trade policies."
00:42:37 - 00:43:21 (43 sec),"We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion dollars of Chinese goods -- and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars."
00:43:21 - 00:44:09 (49 sec),"But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us -- I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs."
00:44:09 - 00:44:41 (31 sec),"Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried -- until now."
00:44:41 - 00:46:17 (97 sec),"Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- or USMCA -- will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure."
00:46:17 - 00:47:32 (75 sec),"I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill -- and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs -- and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions."
00:47:32 - 00:48:35 (63 sec),"Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American Patients."
00:48:35 - 00:49:59 (84 sec),"We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American Freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach."
00:49:59 - 00:51:06 (67 sec),"My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Tonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer."
00:51:06 - 00:52:06 (60 sec),"Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10 year old girl, Grace Ee-line. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer."
00:52:06 - 00:53:00 (54 sec),"Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 dollars for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: ""Last day of Keemo."" Grace -- you are an inspiration to us all."
00:53:00 - 00:54:20 (80 sec),"Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask Congress for $500 million dollars over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child."
00:54:20 - 00:55:03 (43 sec),There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth.
00:55:03 - 00:56:01 (58 sec),"These are living, feeling, beautiful, babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb."
00:56:01 - 00:57:08 (67 sec),"Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security. Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military -- with $700 billion dollars last year and $716 billion dollars this year."
00:57:08 - 00:58:19 (71 sec),"We are also getting other nationsto pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO -- but now we have secured a $100 billion dollar increase in defense spending from NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System."
00:58:19 - 00:58:54 (36 sec),"Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms."
00:58:54 - 01:00:03 (69 sec),"That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't -- in which case,we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula."
01:00:03 - 01:00:41 (38 sec),"Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one."
01:00:41 - 01:01:50 (69 sec),"Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Gwydo. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom -- and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair."
01:01:50 - 01:02:36 (46 sec),"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence -- not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
01:02:36 - 01:03:32 (57 sec),"One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism -- not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel -- and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem."
01:03:32 - 01:04:28 (55 sec),"Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American Heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion dollars in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach."
01:04:28 - 01:05:31 (63 sec),"Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home."
01:05:31 - 01:06:37 (66 sec),"I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor -- and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban."
01:06:37 - 01:07:32 (55 sec),"As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people."
01:07:32 - 01:08:23 (51 sec),"18 years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole -- and last month American Forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole."
01:08:23 - 01:09:33 (70 sec),"My administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country."
01:09:33 - 01:10:33 (60 sec),"We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants Death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish People. We must never ignore the vile poison of Anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an Anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh."
01:10:33 - 01:12:02 (88 sec),SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery -- but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.
01:12:02 - 01:13:56 (114 sec),"He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall -- more than 7 decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp."
01:13:56 - 01:15:03 (67 sec),"Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: ""It's the Americans."" A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau [Dah-kow] Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks."
01:15:03 - 01:16:26 (83 sec),"To me, Joshua recalls, ""the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky."" I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchick. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the Beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American Soldiers who helped liberate Dachau [Dah-kow]. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth."
01:16:26 - 01:17:47 (81 sec),"Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight -- seated side-by-side, here in the home of American Freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation. Very much appreciated. Thank you very much. Thank you. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war."
01:17:47 - 01:18:44 (57 sec),"They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America -- they did it for us. Everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before."
01:18:44 - 01:19:41 (57 sec),"Think of this Capitol -- think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure Civil Rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent Republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California."
01:19:41 - 01:20:24 (43 sec),"Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come."
01:20:24 - 01:21:00 (35 sec),We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our inheritance -- or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.
01:21:00 - 01:21:37 (38 sec),"This is the time to re-ignite the American Imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future -- our fate -- and our choice to make."
01:21:37 - 01:22:24 (47 sec),"I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep Freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's Destiny -- that One Nation, Under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world."
01:22:24 - 01:22:45 (21 sec),"Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and Goodnight."
00:00:00 - 00:00:26 (27 sec),"Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, Kevin. Do we love Kevin? Wow, what a job. What a job. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Where is Kevin sitting? He's around here someplace. Kevin, Thank you. Collects so much money. What do you say $23 -- $23 million? That's not bad. I mean, you are the minority, I hate to say."
00:00:26 - 00:00:48 (22 sec),"That's not going to last long, I don't think. That's not going to last long. It was just a brief little spell. You wanted to take a little break. You shouldn't have done it. I told you that. Don't worry, they blame me. I say, ""What the hell did I have to do with it?"" They said, ""Trump wasn't running."" But you know what?"
00:00:48 - 00:01:13 (25 sec),"We're going to do great. I really believe it. We're going to do great. We're going to take the House back. We are. I feel totally confident about that. We're going to watch those vote tallies. You know, I keep hearing about the election and the -- the various counting measures that they have. There were a lot of close elections that were -- they seemed to, every single one of them went Democrat."
00:01:13 - 00:01:35 (21 sec),"If it was close they say, ""The Democrat -- "" Well, there's something going on -- you got to -- hey, you got to be a little bit more paranoid than you are. Okay. Look, all these beautiful people. These beautiful Republican congressmen and women. But we have to be a little bit careful because I don't like the way the votes are being tallied."
00:01:35 - 00:02:07 (32 sec),"I don't like it and you don't like it either. You just don't want to say it because you're afraid of the press. You're afraid of the press. But we have to be careful. And I have to tell you, though, that this is my third one of these and this is really something. It's thrilling to be here tonight with my many great friends and fellow patriots to support incredible Republican members of Congress -- and you are incredible and you've gone through a lot and you're tougher and stronger than ever."
00:02:07 - 00:02:30 (23 sec),"And I'll tell you, I have never been more unified with you than I am right now for some reason. I don't know what it is. It's true. You helped us on the border, which turned out that you're right on that one. That was when it was a little bit less in vogue than it is today. Now everybody's saying, ""I told you there was an emergency."" But you were there right from the beginning."
00:02:30 - 00:02:49 (18 sec),"I appreciate it. I -- I really mean it. I don't think I've ever been closer to you folks, the people in this room, than I am right now, more so than I was even a year ago -- and it was pretty good then, too. But you're fighting every day for our citizens, our safety, our rights, and our God given freedom."
00:02:49 - 00:03:15 (26 sec),"I especially want to thank the rest of this terrific House Republican leadership team, including Republican Whip, the bravest man in this room, a man who played second base in a game where a shot was hit to him. He had zero range. You know, the Yankees had a guy Bobby Richardson, they say he had the widest range of anybody."
00:03:15 - 00:03:41 (26 sec),"He could get a ball anywhere. Go back to shortstop. He was a second baseman. He had the greatest range of everybody. Steve Scalise had the least range of anybody in the history of second base. And I watched that game and I said, ""Oh, my God, look,"" a shot was hit to second. It was hit hard. A really hard ground ball and he got down, he blocked that sucker."
00:03:41 - 00:04:04 (23 sec),"He then picked it up and he threw it to first. I said, ""Is this a movie we're watching?"" The first pitch and Steve Scalise. And let me tell you, Steve Scalise has courage. I was with him that night and his incredible family, his wife, and he wasn't looking so good. And in a short while -- and the doctor said he wasn't looking so good."
00:04:04 - 00:04:45 (41 sec),"It wasn't such a great prognosis. And I'll tell you what, he fights better than anybody and he's my friend and he's your friend. Steve's Scalise. Where is Steve? Where is Steve? Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Steve. Great guy. I'm glad you're on our side, Steve. Okay. And thank you very much and congratulations and to your family."
00:04:45 - 00:05:13 (28 sec),"Amazing what's happened with you. A person who is tough and smart and somebody that fought very hard, loyal. I did something for a man named Scooter Libby, who was not treated fairly in the eyes of many. I've heard this for many years, was not treated fairly. And Liz and her father -- and they came out early for me. Actually, her father came out like almost immediately for me, and it was interesting because I didn't know him."
00:05:13 - 00:05:29 (16 sec),"I liked him, I respected him, but I didn't know him really. But he came out very early. It was a very important moment, actually, for me because who the hell was supporting me? Everyone thought I was just playing games, right? They said, ""He doesn't really mean this. He's just having fun."" You call this fun?"
00:05:29 - 00:05:55 (26 sec),"It's fun. You get phony witch hunts and you get all the others. This is a lot of fun, folks. Have a good time. ""Have a good time, Donald,"" as I wave goodbye to Fifth Avenue. Great time. But I am having a great time because we're doing a lot. We're doing more than anyone's ever done in a short period of time."
00:05:55 - 00:06:21 (26 sec),"We're doing it together. And I am having a good time -- because we're producing for people. But Liz Cheney was so dedicated and -- and the loyalty. That was just an honor for me to do it because we want to take care of our people that got hurt, our people that got wounded. They got wounded. Just like Steve got wounded."
00:06:21 - 00:06:44 (24 sec),"This was a different kind of a wound. And we took care of them. And she was so happy and her father was so happy because they don't forget. Those are good people. So, Liz, thank you very much. Where is Liz? Where is Liz? Thank you, Liz. I mean that, too. Dedicated. It's called loyal people. We like loyal people."
00:06:44 - 00:07:06 (21 sec),"And our -- and our NRCC chair, Tom Emmer. Tom. Thank you, Tom. Great job. I watched him speaking from back, they have a beautiful camera setup and I looked at my people I said, ""This guy's like central casting."" You couldn't pick a better guy in Hollywood. There's no actor that could do it better. Really, thank you, Tom."
00:07:06 - 00:07:28 (22 sec),"Thank you for the great job more importantly. And a special thanks to the chair of this evening's dinner -- and I've agreed to go to the Caterpillar place where they make those beautiful D10s. I said, ""Are they making the D12 yet?"" ""No, they make that in a different location."" I said, ""Well, Darin, I want to go there then."
00:07:28 - 00:08:04 (37 sec),"I want to see what a D12 looks like."" But we're going, no, we're going to Caterpillar. We'll be there soon. And that's a great company and Darin LaHood does a fantastic job of representing that area. They love him. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be there with Darin. I'll be there. Finally, to all of our wonderful supporters here tonight who pour your time, your energy, your resources, and your heart into defending our great nation, your commitment has never been more important than it is right now and we thank you."
00:08:04 - 00:08:26 (21 sec),"And we are, all together, putting America First. Something you haven't heard for many, many decades, America First. We're putting America First. That's what we're doing. And you see that in our deal with China. you're going to see that in a lot of different things. They're all coming online right now. You're seeing it in a lot of different ways."
00:08:26 - 00:08:47 (22 sec),"It's amazing. You know, we ran on a theme, ""Make America Great Again"". And a lot of people are saying that may have been the greatest theme ever in politics. I think it is that. And it wasn't -- Ronald Reagan had a small thing called, ""Let's Make America Great"". That was good. I don't like it as much. And he sure as hell didn't use it as much."
00:08:47 - 00:09:08 (20 sec),"We had -- we've sold millions and millions of hats. Now you go to a rally everybody has the red hat ""Make America Great Again"". Maybe I can have a little help from you. So we have to make a decision pretty soon because we've done a lot for the country. The stock market's up almost 50 percent. We've gotten rid of the great regulations."
00:09:08 - 00:09:34 (26 sec),"Kevin and everybody have told you -- and the great tax cuts with the legendary Kevin Brady and his group. And we've done all of these things. Where is Kevin? I was actually going to introduce him later, but I'll introduce him right now. Where's Kevin? Thank you, Kevin. What a job this man's done. What a job he's done."
00:09:34 - 00:09:58 (25 sec),"Thank you, Kevin. You really have. But we have to make a decision -- the theme for the next campaign. So we've been here by that time three, three and a half years, we're going into the war with some socialists. And it looks like the only non-sort of heavy Socialist he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists."
00:09:58 - 00:10:23 (25 sec),"They got to him. Our former vice president. He's -- I was going to call him, I don't know him well, I was going to say, ""Welcome to the world, Joe. Are you having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?"" But we're going to be running against somebody that's going to go as far left as possible. They're going to go out there."
00:10:23 - 00:10:48 (25 sec),"And so we have to come up -- do we say it seriously, let me know, do we say, ""Keep America Great?"" My theme was going to be ""Keep America Great"" because we've made it great. And we really have. I mean, we -- China is down 38 percent, Kevin, because of tariffs, okay. See, look at Kevin. You're not unhappy about that."
00:10:48 - 00:11:10 (22 sec),"And we're up 50 percent. And the world is not doing well. Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing well. But we're doing well. We're setting records. We should have another record very shortly in the stock market. I think we have 22 Records, 22, where the stock market hit new highs, 22, 100 percent hours."
00:11:10 - 00:11:26 (16 sec),"We have everyone, 22. And now we're going to have another one it looks like. It was looking a little bit bleaker two or three months ago, but that was artificial, it was artificially caused. But it looks like we're going to have some more. We're going to have a lot more. But I have to decide, do we make a change in the theme?"
00:11:26 - 00:12:00 (34 sec),"So you'll tell me because you'll clap. So we have the greatest theme, I think, really of all time, ""Make America Great Again. ""MAGA"". ""MAGA"". ""MAGA Country"", right? MAGA County. How about the guy from Chicago? The actor that nobody ever heard of, nobody ever -- I said, ""Who the hell is that?"" He said, ""He got taken out by MAGA Country."" I said, ""What the hell was that?"" I guess that's a hate crime, right?"
00:12:00 - 00:12:25 (26 sec),"He got taken out by MAGA Country. But we have ""MAGA"" and we do have ""MAGA Country"". We have people that are so in love with us. We have the greatest base, I believe, in the history of politics or I wouldn't be here. With all the things I've done they never wavered. They never wavered. Can you believe? Anybody else they'd be down to 2 percent right now, and we just had our best -- we just had 51 percent and 54 percent."
00:12:25 - 00:12:57 (31 sec),"And they say you can add 10 percent -- because 10 percent of the people love us, but they're ashamed to say, ""That I'm voting for the president."" I don't care, they're ashamed. And I said, ""Am I supposed to like that?"" I do. We'll take it any way we can get it, right, fellas? Anyway, we can get it. Actually in the one poll, and we have some great pollsters unless it work for CNN, that -- those are -- that's fake news."
00:12:57 - 00:13:24 (27 sec),"You know, polls can be fake news, too. But we have one poll where the pollster said, ""Anybody that says, 'I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to tell you. I don't want to even discuss it -- '"" And they also added another two words, when they call up and they say these two horrible words -- anybody in that category it's a 100 percent vote for Trump."
00:13:24 - 00:13:45 (21 sec),"And what they've done is they don't count that. But now this one counts that, it's 100 percent. We're going to have a great election. The question is, do I go with ""Make America Great Again"" or do I go with ""Keep America Great"" because we made it great in theory. So are you ready? Let's go. Let me hear it. And -- and it is hard."
00:13:45 - 00:14:04 (18 sec),"You know, I was seeing the other day, they were saying it's -- it's probably the greatest theme in the history of politics. I think it is, ""Make America Great Again, MAGA"". How do you give that up for a new one? ""KAG"". ""KAG"". ""Keep America Great. KAG"". I don't know. Maybe it catches on. You never know. You know what?"
00:14:04 - 00:14:42 (38 sec),"First with MAGA I never thought MAGA was going to catch on. And now MAGA, everything's MAGA. I even say just whenever I do a tweet, that's -- boy that has kept us in business, those tweets, huh? Haven't they? It's my only form of defense because the press is 94 percent against us, 94 percent. So, who likes ""Make America Great Again""? And you people are pros, most of you, not all of you."
00:14:42 - 00:15:25 (43 sec),"I see a couple of people I know they have not done well in this business. In fact, they're sitting outside of those doors trying to get in. Who likes ""Keep America Great""? Okay, so ready? ""Make America Great Again"". Or ""Keep America Great"". I don't know. It's -- it's, honestly, I love the idea of ""Keep America Great"" because you know what it says is we've made it great now we're going to keep it great because the Socialists will destroy it. You know, we're doing great but they can destroy what we've done with the steel industry."
00:15:25 - 00:15:49 (24 sec),"Look at what's going on with the steel industry in your district, also, by the way, along with Caterpillar, they're building steel mills, 38 steel mills all over the land, renovation and -- and a lot of new ones. A lot of new ones. Because we decided to put the tariffs on dumped steel, mostly from China, what it's done is beyond anybody's -- it's like one of the hot -- hot things."
00:15:49 - 00:16:06 (17 sec),"And by the way, this country needs steel. We've got to have steel. You know, there are certain things you don't have to have, like, you know, making the suit, you don't have to have, you have to have steel. We need it for defense. You have to have aluminum. And it's incredible what happened to those industries."
00:16:06 - 00:16:26 (20 sec),"So we will make the determination. And honestly, I get a good vibe on both, to be honest. I love the concept. We made it great and now we're going to keep it great, but I hate the concept of throwing away the most successful theme, I think, probably in the history politics. I mean, there's something a little stupid about that, right?"
00:16:26 - 00:16:48 (22 sec),"Let's take MAGA and throw it out. So I have a feeling we maybe we'll try and use both. How about that? We'll try and use both because they're both good. You know. Hillary had a thing like ""Stay Together"" or some crap like that. I think she paid $1.9 million for the genius that gave her the line. I can honestly tell you I didn't pay."
00:16:48 - 00:17:11 (23 sec),"That was made up by me. That was made up by me. But they paid a lot of money. And then the first night, remember, we said, ""It's all about her,"" and then changed the theme the next morning. So that didn't work out too well. Her theme wasn't too good. It wasn't a success. But after two years of Republican leadership, and -- and I have to tell you, we are truly winning again."
00:17:11 - 00:17:35 (24 sec),"Our country is winning again and our country is respected again. And it's, I say, respected like rarely before and we're hitting a new mark. But I say it's respected like rarely before. And with your help, we're restoring the bonds of loyalty and trust between our citizens and their government and we're returning power to where it belongs, with the American people."
00:17:35 - 00:18:09 (35 sec),"To liberate our citizens from bureaucracy we've slashed almost 30,000 pages of job killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record no matter how long a president was in office. Let me see what I look like, huh? Good. I don't see much of a bald spot there. I'm very -- I'm always afraid to look in those cameras."
00:18:09 - 00:18:30 (21 sec),"And again, I want to thank -- and -- and he is a special man. He's a friend of mine, but -- And I introduced him a little earlier, but I'm going to introduce them again because Kevin Brady, and so many of the other fantastic Republicans that passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country and they're for the working families."
00:18:30 - 00:18:52 (22 sec),"We don't get credit for the working families part, but it's the largest tax cuts. And businesses are flowing back into our country because of those tax cuts and because of regulation cuts. So Kevin, again, thank you very much. Really an incredible job. Thank you to everybody that worked with all of us, you know that right?"
00:18:52 - 00:19:14 (22 sec),"We doubled the Child Tax Credit and we virtually ended the unfair Estate Tax, also known as the Death Tax on small businesses and farms. I tell people when I'm in farm country, I said, ""You know, now if you have a farm -- ,"" they used to leave it and the kids would have to go out and borrow a lot of money because they make an income but it's hard."
00:19:14 - 00:19:33 (19 sec),The land is sometimes worth more than the income. And they go borrow money at the end up losing it to a bank a couple of years later. It's -- -not going to be worried about any longer. Now they don't have the Death Tax. They don't have what's known as the Estate Tax. We got rid of it. Kevin did that with a whole group of very good people.
00:19:33 - 00:19:57 (24 sec),"And that's a big deal. That's a big deal. People are very happy. I always say, jokingly, ""So now if you love your children you can leave your farm or your small business to your children and they don't have to go borrow money and take a risk. If you don't leave your children -- if you don't love them, if you don't just really love them it doesn't matter because you're not going to leave it to them anyway."
00:19:57 - 00:20:22 (25 sec),"So this tax doesn't mean a damn thing. This tax won't help you much."" But most of them leave it to their children, I guess. To bring back American jobs we slashed the business tax rate down from one of the highest anywhere in the developed world, down to a number that nobody believed that we could get down to. We were at, if you really add it up, we were over 40 percent."
00:20:22 - 00:20:46 (25 sec),"It was an impossible situation. And you know, so many things are in that deal like bringing back money. Billions and billions of dollars is pouring back into a country that could not get back here. It was impossible, not only because of the high tax rates, nobody would bring it back -- over 40 percent, but also because of the bureaucracy which we killed in our tax plan."
00:20:46 - 00:21:10 (24 sec),"So billions of dollars. Apple recently announced $230 billion is going to be brought back into our country from overseas that they would never have even thought of bringing back and they're going to spend it building new facilities here. That's a lot, $230 billion. And we're fixing broken trade deals to protect the American workers."
00:21:10 - 00:21:29 (19 sec),"And we are standing up to China's chronic trading abuses and theft of intellectual properties and so many other things that they've done to us. I don't know how you people allowed this to happen for so many years. You've been here longer than me. But they really have, they've taken advantage of our country."
00:21:29 - 00:21:49 (20 sec),"And you know what? I respect them for it. I say it. We should have been doing that to them. I was in China making a speech. President Xi, who is a strong man, I call him King, he said, ""But I am not King, I am president."" I said, ""No, you're president for life and therefore, you're King."" He said, ""Huh. Huh."" He liked that."
00:21:49 - 00:22:11 (22 sec),"So I call him King. I get along with them great. But I was really hitting him hard about how they've hurt our country. And I had 5,000 Chinese people, I'm China, I'm in Beijing doing this, can you believe it? And I'm looking down, he's getting angrier and angrier. And then I saved it. I said, ""You know, I don't blame you."
00:22:11 - 00:22:38 (27 sec),"I blame the leaders of our country for allowing it to happen."" And it's really true. We should never have allowed that to happen. And we're getting a lot of it back. You're going to see it. And your farmers, all of you representing farm territory -- You know, I was with the Vice Premier about two weeks ago, and I said, ""You got to do me a favor of goodwill,"" because we have such a strong country right now, economically, stronger than anybody by far."
00:22:38 - 00:22:55 (17 sec),"You know, they were catching us. They would have -- they would have caught us within a short period of time. They we're catching us. Within two years, by the end of my term, if you had a normal president, I don't want to say that negatively, I think I'm very normal, but if you had a normal -- you know what I mean."
00:22:55 - 00:23:16 (21 sec),"In other words, if you had a stiff as president -- which most of them are, I hate to say -- they would have caught us. But right now it's going to be a long time before they catch us. A long time. I told you, they're down 38 percent, we're up 50 percent. That made a lot of difference. It's like day and night."
00:23:16 - 00:23:44 (28 sec),"But we really have to be strong with these nations because these nations are taking advantage, not just China, everybody has a trade surplus on us -- almost every nation in the world. When I took over we lost eight -- I said, ""How are we doing on trade? I want to break down,"" my first meeting. They said, ""Sir, we're down $807 billion."" I said, ""You got to be kidding?"" No, seriously, I thought they were joking, right?"
00:23:44 - 00:24:08 (24 sec),"We were down $807. We're losing over $800 billion in trade. We're starting to turn it. We have the USMCA. I hope you guys can get it approved. I mean, the problem we have -- is that you have a very hostile group. You have a very, very hostile group on the other side, and they don't want to see us have success and the USMCA is a great deal."
00:24:08 - 00:24:30 (22 sec),"It's great. Again, I said, ""If you don't do this we're going to tariff every product coming out of your country at 25 percent."" And every time I had a problem I would just take -- you know, especially cars. I had a little plastic car on my desk and I'd have the leaders come over and I just take the car out, put it on the front of the desk, they say, ""Okay, we agree."" Because the big thing is the cars."
00:24:30 - 00:24:55 (25 sec),"Canada's sending us tremendous numbers of cars. They're practically un-taxed, and yet they don't take our agricultural product, in many cases, and in many cases they charge 297 percent tariffs and it's very unfair. Canada's very, very tough. You know, we love Canada. We think of the beautiful song and the ice hockey games, Oh, Canada, isn't it beautiful?"
00:24:55 - 00:25:23 (28 sec),"But in the meantime, they knock the hell out of us on trade and they have been doing it for a long time. And they're very tough. And they're not at all nice about that situation. But we've made them nice. We've made them nice. And they're not happy about what happened. But our farmers are going to be able to sell now into Canada, which they were restricted from doing and -- and they're going to be able to sell into a lot of places."
00:25:23 - 00:25:50 (27 sec),"And the Vice Premier said when I said, ""Give us a token of affection."" He said, ""We will immediately by 10 million tons of soybeans."" And I looked at Sonny Perdue, who's doing a fantastic job, as you know, Secretary of Agriculture -- I said, ""Sonny, is 10 million tons of soybeans a lot? It sounds -- "" He said, ""That's a lot."" And they started buying 10 million."
00:25:50 - 00:26:22 (32 sec),"So the farmers are so incredible -- and I saw them interviewed last week. They had a couple of farmers on. We love the farmers. I'll tell you. I'm never going to forget the farmers. They -- they sort of got me here, wouldn't you think? And they said, ""Well, you know -- "" because China and various of these countries that were rightfully doing numbers on them because we have no choice what they've done to us. But they're going to start buying at numbers that you've never seen before."
00:26:22 - 00:26:43 (21 sec),"But farmers said, ""We know how badly China has taken advantage of this country. And we may be getting a little bit hurt right now but we're with the president all the way."" They have every single farmer, every person I've seen they have these focus groups, every farmer has said the same thing. And you know, the amazing thing about farmers?"
00:26:43 - 00:27:08 (25 sec),"We had a little bit of a soft patch and I called in a group of 15 or 20 representative farmers and I wanted to give them help, I wanted to give them aid. And they looked at me and said, ""We don't want aid. We don't want it."" And I said, ""What do you mean?"" Because I'm so used to having people come in, wanting help, wanting aid, wanting whatever it is they want."
00:27:08 - 00:27:30 (21 sec),"And these people didn't want it. They just wanted me to make a fair platform. And I said, ""I'll never forget this meeting. I will never forget it,"" because again, I meet with a lot of different groups and they're always asking for an advantage. Okay, I'm not blaming anybody. These farmers didn't want it. They said, ""We don't want that, sir."
00:27:30 - 00:27:51 (22 sec),"We don't want any help. We just want a -- really a level playing field."" I thought it was incredible. I've told that story so many times. So we love our farmers. Let them know we're very close, because you are going to have -- In fact, when I asked China -- and I'm doing that, that'll be the end of the -- if we get there and you know, let's see what happens."
00:27:51 - 00:28:14 (22 sec),"Who knows? I think we're doing very well. They need the deal more than we do. You see what's -- they need the deal. And they getting hurt badly with the -- you know, they're paying 25 percent on $50 billion worth of technology stuff and they were going to pay 25 percent on another $200 billion. But I started them at $10 because I'm nice."
00:28:14 - 00:28:52 (38 sec),"And then we were dealing well, this was three, four weeks ago. You remember. And they said, ""Would it be possible for you not to raise the 10 percent to 25 percent?"" which would automatically kick in? I said, ""Yes,"" because you know it's a little hard to negotiate with them when we start raising it. But after that, they have $340 billion left that I haven't even text and their bullets are gone because we do $600 billion worth of purchases from them, and they do $97 billion worth of purchases from us. Not exactly great."
00:28:52 - 00:29:16 (25 sec),"But now they were paying for that. And they were paying big. One thing, as an example, on cars, if they sold a car to us we bring it in for no tax. It's 2.5 percent, but basically, when you do certain paperwork and check the wrong boxes you pay nothing. It's stupid. When we buy a car from them, and we buy a lot of them, believe it or not, it's a 40 percent tax."
00:29:16 - 00:29:34 (18 sec),"So they get 40 percent, we get nothing, other than that it's been a very good deal. I get a call two months ago, toward the beginning of the negotiation, that they're bringing the 40 percent down to 15 percent. I said, ""That's good, but it's still not zero. It's still not what we have."" You know, it's good."
00:29:34 - 00:29:54 (20 sec),"I'm not thrilled. I got a call from -- and but that's coming down. It's all coming down. I got a call from Prime Minister Modi of India. They're one of the highest taxing nations in the world. They taxed us 100 percent. Look, he's nodding, you know what I'm talking about. They charge us 100 percent tariffs on goods."
00:29:54 - 00:30:20 (26 sec),"So they send a motorcycle -- and they make a lot of them -- Indian cycles. They send them to our country, we charge them nothing. We send a Harley Davidson to India and they charge us 100 percent. Not fair, okay. Not reciprocal. It's not fair. And for those of you, like Sean, and like -- where's Sean? Where the hell is my guy from Wisconsin?"
00:30:20 - 00:30:56 (37 sec),"He's so great. Where is he? This guy's a champion. Him and where's Jim? 128 -- 128 and 1. Where the hell is Jim Jordan? Where the hell is he? Is he here? 128. Where is he? This guy, NCAA, What a lousy location. Holy -- are you kidding me? Wait, stand up again. I can't see you. It's too far away. I can't believe it. Wow, Jim, I've just lost all respect for Jim."
00:30:56 - 00:31:17 (20 sec),"That's it. One hundred twenty eight and one in wrestling, NCAA Wrestling Champion. And you know when you're that -- when you're that good, don't kid yourself, folks. A lot of us up here, not just here, a lot of it's right up here. And he's a warrior and Sean's a warrior. And Sean now is working on the Reciprocal Trade Act."
00:31:17 - 00:31:40 (23 sec),"If they charge us, we charge them, very simple. They charge us, we charge them. And I think you're doing great on it, Sean, and I appreciate it, man. Great job. But he's the tree climbing, you know, these characters to go up the trees then they come down. He said, ""No, going up isn't the hard part, it's coming down because if you miss you're dead."" And he said he's missed about four times."
00:31:40 - 00:32:04 (25 sec),"But he's a five time world champion going up a tree. Did anybody know that? See, to me that means something because being a champion is something -- And that's one that is tough stuff and dangerous stuff. So listen, I appreciate your help, Sean. It's incredible. That's incredible. I'm still more impressed with a championship stuff, but that's -- So we've ended the war on American energy."
00:32:04 - 00:32:31 (26 sec),"The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And that all happened over the last two years. Big difference. Hillary wanted to put up wind. Wind. If you -- if you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value."
00:32:31 - 00:32:55 (25 sec),"And they say the noise causes cancer. You told me that one. Okay. You know, the thing makes it -- it's so -- And of course, it's like a graveyard for birds. If you love birds you'd never want to walk under a windmill because it's a very sad, sad sight. It's like a cemetery. We put a little -- we put a little statue for the poor birds."
00:32:55 - 00:33:25 (30 sec),"It's true. You know, in California, if you shoot a Bald Eagle they put you in jail for five years and yet, the windmills wipe them all out. It's true. They wipe them out. It's terrible. And I told the other day at CPAC, great people at CPAC. We had an incredible thing. I had nothing to do. It was early on a Saturday morning I had just gotten back from dealing with Kim Jong-un. We had to walk."
00:33:25 - 00:33:42 (17 sec),"He wasn't ready for deal. That's okay, because we get along great. He wasn't ready. I told him, ""You're not ready for a deal."" That's the first time anybody has ever told him that and left. It's never happened to him before. Nobody's ever left. But I said, ""You're not ready for a deal, but we'll make it deal."" We have a good relationship."
00:33:42 - 00:34:09 (27 sec),"We have a good relationship. But I told a story about CPAC, the woman, she wants to watch television and she says to her husband, ""Is the wind blowing? I'd love to watch your show tonight, darling. The wind hasn't blown for three days. I can't watch television, darling. Darling, please tell the wind to blow."" No, wind's not so good."
00:34:09 - 00:34:25 (16 sec),"And you know, you have no idea how expensive it is to make those things. They're all made in China and Germany, by the way, just in case you -- We don't make them here, essentially. We don't make them here. And by the way, the carbon and all of the things flying up in the air, you know, the carbon footprint?"
00:34:25 - 00:34:54 (29 sec),"President Obama used to talk about the carbon footprint and he'd hop on Air Force One, a big 747 with very old engines, and he'd fly to Hawaii to play a round of golf. Now, you tell me, the carbon footprint. But that's the way it is. We have the greatest energy in the world. They wanted to take it away from us. They don't like that we have it. We've really discovered it over the last very short period of time."
00:34:54 - 00:35:15 (21 sec),"I've made it readily accessible. We're approving pipelines in Texas that would have taken 20 years. I'm getting them done in about six months. You guys all know that the Texas guys. And by the way, if they're not good, if there's something wrong, if it's going to hurt our water, if it's going to hurt our air, if it's going to -- we're not going to approve them."
00:35:15 - 00:35:34 (19 sec),"But you're going to know in 12 months instead of in 20 years, at the end of 20 years you start off as a young man or woman and now you're getting ready to retire and they're getting ready to vote on your project, right, whatever the hell it may be. You know, highways, Elaine Chao is doing a great job, by the way, as our Secretary."
00:35:34 - 00:35:56 (22 sec),"Great job. But highways, in many cases, would take 20 or 21 years to get approved. Think of it. In some cases, not even a highway, it's like a roadway. And I have a down now to two years. We got rid of so much of the waste and the stupidity. And you know, a lot of this happened because of consultants, environmental engineers, they call themselves."
00:35:56 - 00:36:17 (22 sec),"I have -- I've heard many of them. I've lost plenty of money with those guys. And I used to see him up at Albany. I'd say, ""How come you're here? Why are you here? You represent me. Why are you here?"" They're trying to get a bill passed that makes it harder to get permits and my guy is there trying to get the bill because I have to pay them more money that way, my consultant."
00:36:17 - 00:36:47 (30 sec),"So we took down highways from, in many cases 20 years, till probably -- we want to get it down to one year and then maybe get rejected but you'll get it rejected quickly. You're going to know. It's like Jack Nicklaus is a friend of mine. He said standing over a four foot putt, he never missed them, but he told me Chichi Rodriguez, great putter, he get up, he was a character and he'd just putt."
00:36:47 - 00:37:06 (19 sec),"Get up, bing. Get up, bing. It wouldn't take any time. Get up, bing. He had an expression, ""Miss it quick."" You ever hear that expression? He was a character. ""Miss it quick."" I'd get up, ""Miss it quick."" But he didn't miss too many. But that's what we're doing. We're going to make sure that you get it and if it doesn't work we're going to let you know."
00:37:06 - 00:37:36 (30 sec),"There was a highway, a small highway in a state where some friends are in this room. It is 21 years. It was going to cost $5 million 21 years ago. Now it's going to cost $900 million and it took 21 years to get it approved. And it used to be a straight line. Right? So if somebody's a little tipsy, they had too many drinks, which is a bad thing, at least they could drive straight."
00:37:36 - 00:38:03 (27 sec),"Now in order to get away from nesting turtles, rattlesnakes, and everything else, that highway is the craziest looking sucker you've ever seen. It's twice as long as it was supposed to be. My father and I would have designed it a straight path, point to point, right? And but it took -- and it cost, you know, I mean, literally, almost hundreds of times more than it was supposed to cost."
00:38:03 - 00:38:24 (20 sec),"And it's dangerous. People are running into the -- they don't know how, but they're running into things that they're not supposed to. So we're straightening things out. There are many, many stories like that. The great aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, I go to see it and the catapult system, you know, the catapult, that's what's throws the plane off."
00:38:24 - 00:38:47 (23 sec),"So the aircraft carrier, there's a slight problem. It was supposed to cost $3 billion. It ended up costing about $16 billion right now. It wasn't on my watch. But it's getting close. The President Gerald Ford. Big. The largest ship ever built they say. It's a massive ship. So I get on there but they're having trouble with the catapult system because it used to be steam."
00:38:47 - 00:39:13 (25 sec),"You've seen it where the planes go off steam, old-fashioned, right? Old-fashioned. So they've decided to go magnetic -- never been done before -- and electronic. So it's very, very complex. They have these brilliant guys from MIT, where my uncle was a professor, by the way, for 40 years, brilliant guy, Dr. John Trump."
00:39:13 - 00:39:45 (33 sec),"A lot of people find it hard to believe that I had a professor -- one of the smartest people in the history of MIT, in my blood. You'd be surprised. A lot of things are surprising in life. But you have to go to MIT to figure out how this damn thing works. So I get to the boat. ""How's it going?"" ""Well, it's okay, sir, but we're having a little problem with the catapult system."" You know, that's not like so good."
00:39:45 - 00:40:21 (36 sec),"I mean, we have an aircraft carrier and you can't send planes off the damn thing. Historically, that has not proven to be a good thing for aircraft carriers. So -- so I said, ""Let me see -- "" I didn't want to see the admirals. You get tired of the admirals because this was a problem. I said,"" Let me see the catapult people."" They said, ""Sir, you don't really want to do that."" I said, ""Yeah, those are the people that know what the hell they're doing."" This thing is $900 million over budget to throw the planes off."
00:40:21 - 00:40:51 (30 sec),"And we could have had steam and it would have been done and we would have saved hundreds of millions of dollars. So I get the catapult guys, five guys come over. ""Yes, sir."" ""What do you do?"" ""Sir, I've been a catapulter. By the way, he's more proud of being a catapulter than Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady, and all of you big, high ranking Republicans are doing what the hell -- They -- they would be so bored doing what you're doing."
00:40:51 - 00:41:22 (31 sec),"Dealing with Democrats all day. That's not fun. But I said, ""So what do you do?"" He said, ""I'm a catapulter, 20 years. Yes, sir. What would you like to know, sir?"" ""Very simple question. What's better, an electric catapult or steam?"" ""Sir, steam is better."" I said, ""It's better."" I said, ""Why is it better?"" ""Well, for one thing the electric goes faster, sir."
00:41:22 - 00:41:49 (27 sec),"But it takes you two and a half minutes to bring the plane to the site. No matter what you do it's still the same two and a half. So we don't have to send the plane off every second. By the time the steam builds up we have plenty of time left. That's number one, sir. I can give you 10 other reasons but another one, sir, if the steam breaks I can fix it myself with a wrench."
00:41:49 - 00:42:10 (21 sec),"If the electronics breaks, sir, we have to send for Albert Einstein -- to try and fix it. We can't figure this damn thing out."" I never saw -- this is what happens. This is what happens. This is what happens. I hate to say it, when they make airplanes so damn complex that pilots can't fly him this is what happens."
00:42:10 - 00:42:33 (23 sec),"Now, up to a point you want to go. But we have to be careful. We're spending money on things and it's almost like they do it just to do it. And we want to be careful. We want to be smart. So we're getting that problem fixed, but it's a hell of a problem. We've confirmed 53 District Court Judges and 37 Circuit Court Judges -- who are going to interpret the Constitution as written."
00:42:33 - 00:42:52 (20 sec),"Anybody not like that here? Not too many people in this room. I can tell you a lot of people in another room across the way. Along with two outstanding Supreme Court Judges, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and as you know, Brett Kavanaugh -- who was put through a grinder like nobody has ever been put through a grinder."
00:42:52 - 00:43:17 (25 sec),"That was so unfair. That was so unfair. And Congress passed, and I'm very proud of this -- where's Greg? Greg. Greg, where are you? We worked hard on this. Greg. Greg. Right. You know what I'm going to say, Greg, because this is a great thing and I hope nobody in this room has to do it. But you know, Right to Choose."
00:43:17 - 00:43:47 (30 sec),"Right. Right. We have a right, a right. And we did something else with Greg and with everybody, we passed Choice for our military, Choice. So we have in one case, Choice, we have another, Right To Try. And I don't know if the people know what even Right To Try -- I kept saying to myself, as I was a civilian -- you don't want to use it. You don't want to use it. But I've had friends over the years, they're very ill, terminally ill."
00:43:47 - 00:44:10 (23 sec),"And if they have money they travel all over the world looking for a cure. If they don't have money they go home and there's nothing they can do. And Right To Try, which Greg and everybody was so incredible with, and we got it done, right? That was an easy. You'd think it was easy. But you know, the country had a problem because they didn't want to be sued if it doesn't work."
00:44:10 - 00:44:41 (30 sec),"The insurance companies had a problem. The drug companies had a problem because they didn't want it on their record. So we said, ""Well, I'll tell you what, we won't put these people that are so terminally ill, so sick, we won't put them on the record."" They said, ""We like that. We have a separate category."
00:44:41 - 00:45:19 (39 sec),"We like that."" And then the insurance companies had a tremendous problem. But the country did too, so I said, ""Here's what we do, they have to sign a document that exculps, that gets rid of all liability to our country. Because you know, they don't make it and then they sue our country. And I could never understand why they didn't get this passed because the law was we don't want to hurt people."
00:45:19 - 00:45:59 (40 sec),"So we don't want to give them a cure. We don't want to hurt people. And I'll tell you what, and for all of the people in this room, and every one of you who's here, you can feel proud because we have had such success. We have saved lives already and this is only seven months ago that we signed it. We've saved lives already with people going -- and what it does, is it really does, I mean, it's the ultimate test for a drug or for a possible cure."
00:45:59 - 00:46:28 (29 sec),"What's better than this? It's been a tremendous success and we got it done. It's something nobody talks about, but it's something that a lot of people respect -- and it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy. So thank you, Greg. That was a great job on that. And we pass VA Accountability. So not only VA Choice. VA Choice."
00:46:28 - 00:47:00 (32 sec),"They're standing in line for weeks and weeks in many cases, weeks and weeks, think of it. And now, rather -- these are great veterans. They stand on line, and now they go, they see a doctor, we pay for it. It doesn't matter. Number one, we do save money. It doesn't matter. We're saving lives. People are ill."
00:47:00 - 00:47:15 (16 sec),"By the time they get to the doctor they are terminally ill. And we're saving lives. But we also have done so many other things for our veterans. And if you notice, there's not a lot of complaints coming out of the VA for the first time. How long has it been since you've seen a VA that's really been well run?"
00:47:15 - 00:47:33 (18 sec),"They're doing a phenomenal job. But Accountability is great, where if they treat our veterans badly -- we have now Accountability. We say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired."" We fire them. You couldn't fire him. They could steal. They could be sadists. They were sadists. They were hurting our veterans."
00:47:33 - 00:47:59 (26 sec),"We couldn't do anything about it. And we also passed, just now, some of you in the room were there with me, a little while ago, criminal justice reform. And I'll tell you, a lot of people are very happy about that. A lot of people. And thanks to our bold agenda, we enacted with House Republicans, America now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
00:47:59 - 00:48:34 (35 sec),"We're the hottest in the world. Wherever I meet a president, a prime minister, anybody, they say, ""Congratulations on your economy."" And since our election, we've created more than 5.3 million new jobs, including half a million jobs and that number is going up to about 618,000 jobs very soon, these are manufacturing jobs that President Obama said will never happen."
00:48:34 - 00:48:58 (24 sec),"""You'd need a magic wand. It's not going to happen. Well, it's happening. We have the magic wand. And more than five million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps because we have jobs, now. Think of that. The numbers are staggering, five million off of foods. And after years of stagnation wages are rising fast and the lowest paid workers are making the biggest gains."
00:48:58 - 00:49:30 (32 sec),"We've done more things than we promised. Many more things. Like this one, African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment, and you know this because you've heard me say it and other people say it, and veteran unemployment, that's a great one, have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:49:30 - 00:49:59 (29 sec),"I mean, how do you beat that? When they talk about African American and what they want to do, I say, ""Well, I have not much to say, except that we've just hit the absolute lowest unemployment rate for African Americans in the history of our country. That's all I have to say. Goodbye, everybody."" We won the debate, right?"
00:49:59 - 00:50:21 (22 sec),"We won the debate. It should be easy. It will be interesting to see. But don't underestimate the power of Socialism to get a vote. It's what happens over a 10-year period when the country is destroyed -- but they don't care about that. When they say, ""We're going to give you a free education. We're going to give you free health care."
00:50:21 - 00:50:45 (24 sec),"We're going to not have you pay your loans for college. We're going to give you free everything. Everything is free,"" it's very seductive to people. It's not going to be so easy like you think. Now, in 10 years it's going to be easy when the country goes to hell because that's what happens, the country goes to hell."
00:50:45 - 00:51:12 (27 sec),"It happened many times. Look at Venezuela. I mean, this was the richest country in that whole -- I mean, outside of us, it was one of the richest countries in the world and now they have no food, they have no electric, they have nothing. It's sad. And that's Socialism. But when you're standing up on a stage, and a guy said, ""We're going to wipe out all costs for education."
00:51:12 - 00:51:40 (29 sec),"We're going to wipe out all healthcare. We're going to give you single payer."" They don't say that you're going to wipe out 180 private plans that people love. But it's not as easy as people think. People think it's easy. It is easy in 10 years, it's not easy now, because a lot of folks are going to say, ""Hey, wait a minute, man, if I vote for Trump, I agree the economy is good, but this guy's giving me everything."" Not that easy."
00:51:40 - 00:52:04 (23 sec),"So we have to work. We can never take it for granted. We have to explain how bad it really is. We have to do that. But this is a time of extraordinary opportunity for our nation, extraordinary. That's why, in my State of the Union Address, I asked new Democrat majority in the House to work with us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure."
00:52:04 - 00:52:22 (19 sec),"And I think we're going to have something, maybe, we could do it bipartisan there, bring down the cost of healthcare, and bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Bring down the cost. Thank you. I love that you're clapping for that because we have to talk quickly about health care to have this power in this room."
00:52:22 - 00:52:49 (27 sec),"How often do you get that? And we are going to finally secure our nation's borders. It's happening right now. And I said to Mexico last week -- you know, they have the strongest immigration laws in the world. They don't have judges. Somebody gets on their land, they say, ""Get out of here, now."" Somebody touches our land, we bring them into court, you need Perry Mason to represent them."
00:52:49 - 00:53:09 (20 sec),"They're here for years. They never come back for the trial. They say, ""Let's bring them into court. We'll bring them in. Well, you just stepped on a property. Bring them in. Be gentle. Bring them into court."" And it's called Catch and Release. It may be the dumbest program in the history of the world. You catch them and you release them."
00:53:09 - 00:53:28 (19 sec),"Oh, wonderful. We've done a great job. And then, ""You're going to come back, sir, in four years from now. January 14th, you're going to come back and we're going to give you a trial to see whether or not you can stay. But in the meantime, we're releasing you into our country."" Now, only two percent come back for the trial."
00:53:28 - 00:53:49 (21 sec),"Okay. And those are not the smartest ones, to be honest with you. The ones that come back or not the smartest ones. The 98 percent are much more than the two percent that come back. It's terrible. But I said to Mexico, ""Listen, you have the strongest immigration."" They don't have courts. They don't have Catch and Release."
00:53:49 - 00:54:10 (21 sec),"They don't have Chain Migration. They don't have Visa Lottery, a lottery. You pick a lottery. ""Oh, you're going to the United States. Congratulations."" The country does this. Do you think they put their best people in those lotteries? What the hell were you people thinking when you approved these deals? They say in all fairness, it is purely -- that's a Chuck Schumer deal."
00:54:10 - 00:54:31 (21 sec),"That was when they had enough muscle. They got this stuff passed. It's incredible. Think of it. They put names and you pick a name. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to announce so and so,"" I don't want to use names because I'll get in trouble because it's always somebody going to leak this whole damn speech to the media -- to the Fake News so I won't use the name that I'm thinking about."
00:54:31 - 00:54:57 (25 sec),"Congratulations. And then you find out he's a stone cold killer, served many years in -- These are the people they give us. What do you think? Do you think they're going to give us their finest? They don't give us -- and we take them in, ""Congratulations."" Crazy CNN, they had a reporter, they're walking up -- I mean, how bad -- I mean, how bad."
00:54:57 - 00:55:17 (21 sec),"Now they're saying, ""We were never against him with respect to collusion. We were just reporting the news."" Did you see that? That's their new theory? You know, that they weren't -- in other words, that they will fair. Yeah, they were fair. But they're interviewing this group of people, ""And what are you coming to the United States for?"" A woman says, ""Well, I'm coming for my daughter."" ""Okay, that's fair."
00:55:17 - 00:55:45 (27 sec),"What are you coming -- "" Then they go to this man, a little rough looking, ""And what are you coming for?"" ""Asylum."" ""Ah. Why?"" ""I murdered someone."" ""Oh."" The woman goes like, ""What? You murdered."" Did anybody see that? ""I murdered someone,"" he said. Right? You saw it. And she's like, ""Oh, man. Okay, back to headquarters, please."" You know, because they're trying to say how good everybody is, that these are wonderful people."
00:55:45 - 00:56:19 (35 sec),"And some of them are wonderful people. Remember when I made my first feature in Trump Tower coming down the escalator with our great First Lady that everybody loves? Everybody loves our First Lady. And I talked about different things. And I mentioned the word rape. And everybody thought it was a great speech and then about two days later, it was like sort of a delayed reaction, two days later, they said, ""He said rape! He said all sorts of -- "" Let me tell you, and I took heat."
00:56:19 - 00:56:43 (24 sec),"Do you remember the first six months? Man were they killing me in that speech. It went from being a great speech to being a disaster. And now you look at that speech and you see what's happening and that speech was so tame compared to what really is happening. That trek up from Guatemala, and Honduras, and El Salvador, it's one of the great, dangerous treks anywhere."
00:56:43 - 00:57:13 (30 sec),"And Mexico has now, because they don't want the border closed, because Mexico makes a hell of a lot of money off us. They took 30 percent of our car business. I wasn't here. The new USMCA will stop that. No more car companies are going to Mexico when they sign this deal. No more car companies. That was the most important thing for me. So now, Mexico, I said I'm closing it and I really wanted to close it, but now Mexico is saying, ""No, no, no."" The first time in decades."
00:57:13 - 00:57:32 (19 sec),"We will not let anybody get through. And they've apprehended over 1,000 people today at the -- at the Southern border, their Southern border, and they're bringing it back into their country. I said, ""Why the hell didn't somebody do that in the first place?"" But they don't want the border closed. And you know who else doesn't want the border closed, the Democrats?"
00:57:32 - 00:58:02 (30 sec),"They don't want the border closed. And I agree, it's going to be a big toll. But trade, and commerce, and making money for our country, it's all very important, but to me the most important job I have is the security of our country, even more important than those other things that I talk about all the time -- it's the security of our country."
00:58:02 - 00:58:28 (25 sec),"Instead of choosing greatness for America, House Democrats responded with radicalism, resistance. ""Resist"", that's their theme. ""Make America Great Again"" is ours, theirs is ""Resist"". You don't know what the hell they're resisting. They go around saying, ""Resist,"" and they do resist. Revenge, crazy hoaxes like we just went through, and ridiculous conspiracy theories."
00:58:28 - 00:59:12 (44 sec),"We have -- just incredible when you see what is coming out. And while Republicans are working every day to empower the American people, the Democratic agenda is all about themselves. That's all they think about is themselves. Okay? It's a disgrace what's going on. It's a disgrace. I said to somebody that's been here a long time, you people would know better than anybody, some of you that have been here, ""Has it ever been this bad?"" And they said, ""Well,"" they said, ""Yes, it was."" They said, ""During the Clinton impeachment hearings it was worse."" They said, ""There was another time in the 1880s when it was worse."" A couple of people were shot, you know."
00:59:12 - 00:59:33 (21 sec),"Even new people wouldn't do that. And the Civil War, who could forget? I would say the Civil War was bad. And by the way, speaking of the Civil War, where is Doug Collins? You're another warrior? Where's Doug Collins? Where the hell is Doug? Man, he's up there fighting. Doug. Thank you, Doug. Warrior. Where's Mark Meadows, another warrior?"
00:59:33 - 01:00:00 (27 sec),"Where's Mark Meadows? What the hell is -- Oh, don't tell me he's got one of those bad seats. Are you with Jim Jordan? That's the Freedom Caucus. What the hell happened to you guys? They're great guys. They are. Everybody in this room as far as I'm concerned. Nearly 100 House Democrats are promoting the biggest Socialist takeover in U.S. history."
01:00:00 - 01:00:24 (24 sec),"That's what's happening. The Green New Deal, it'll cost $100 trillion. Nobody has any idea what that means, $100 trillion. I have wealthy friends they say, ""Write out $1 trillion."" They have no idea. They just keep going. They say, ""Nobody has any idea."" The Democrats are also proposing a massive government takeover of healthcare that would ban private health insurance."
01:00:24 - 01:00:54 (30 sec),"And that's a tremendous thing for us to run on. Because people want -- we have 180 million people that want that. The Democratic plan would destroy American healthcare, bankrupt our country, oh, forget it, not even close, and take away your private doctors. Now, I'm only afraid that we're going to be too hard on the Green New Deal and they're not going to do it, because I want them to do it. We don't want to have them knock it out before we get to run against it so let's take it easy."
01:00:54 - 01:01:31 (37 sec),"I'm -- I'm actually saying, ""It's a wonderful thing."" The Green New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29-years -- old. A young bartender, wonderful young woman, the Green New Deal. You know, but it's crazy. You know, the first time I heard I said, ""That's the craziest thing."" You have senators that are professionals that you guys know that have been there for a long time, white hair, everything perfect, and they're standing behind her and they're shaking, they're petrified of her, ""We support the Green New Deal."" How about the woman from Hawaii, the senator from Hawaii -- highly nice woman, right?"
01:01:31 - 01:01:58 (27 sec),"Oh, I'm glad I didn't say it. I'm going to get great points from my wife for not saying that -- but she was so angry to men, right? Remember, she was screaming at men? And -- and then they asked her about the Green New Deal. ""I love it."" They said, ""Yeah, but you don't allow airplanes anymore so you can't get to Hawaii."" ""Oh, we have to work on something."" So somebody jokingly said, ""We'll build a train to Hawaii,"" and she actually thought it was a decent idea."
01:01:58 - 01:02:23 (24 sec),"So now she supports it because she thinks they're going to build a train to Hawaii. But they really believe this stuff. And you know, it's like, it's the craziest thing. They believe it. And we will have to do something but don't do it too early, please. Don't kill it because we want to be able to run against it. If they beat me with the Green New Deal I deserve to lose."
01:02:23 - 01:02:50 (27 sec),"It's true. And just to finish up, and -- and this is so important, and -- and you know, I'm doing this almost as let's get together and talk because we have to win. We have to take back the House. We have to. There's no reason to have lost it. And what really lost it and really helped us lose it was healthcare because we didn't have an alternative."
01:02:50 - 01:03:07 (17 sec),"We just said, ""Well, let's not talk -- "" Somebody came out the other day, they asked a Republican, two weeks ago, health care and he turned off the mic, ""Well, I'm going home now."" You can't do that. You got to confront it. We'll be the party of healthcare. Republicans should not run away from healthcare."
01:03:07 - 01:03:29 (22 sec),"You can't do it. You're going to get clobbered. And I have an idea and I think it's great. I spoke with Kevin about it. I spoke with a lot of your really top people, smart people, and they love it. I spoke with the Senate about it. I spoke to Mitch. Mitch didn't like it, but then he found out when we're taking the vote, right after the election."
01:03:29 - 01:03:56 (28 sec),"He said, ""Oh, I like that idea."" And I understood why he didn't like it at the beginning because it's been a tough subject. It's been a subject stay away. If we stay away from that subject we're going to lose. We're going to lose. We can't stay away. It's too important. It's too important, because the Democrats -- You know what?"
01:03:56 - 01:04:21 (25 sec),"We have the border. We have, if you look at it, we have the immigration but we have a lot -- we have the crime. We have the police. We have the military. We have so much. They have health care right now. We have to take that away from them. We take that away -- we take that away we will not even come close."
01:04:21 - 01:04:43 (22 sec),"So here's the concept, we have to protect and cannot run away from a thing called preexisting conditions. We can't do it. You're going to get clobbered. A friend of mine is running in a certain state. I'm not going to embarrass him. He's got a 20-point lead. He's running for governor. 20-point lead, it's over."
01:04:43 - 01:05:16 (33 sec),"About a month later I say, ""Hey,"" the election hadn't take place -- taken place, I said, ""How is it going out there? How's he doing?"" ""Sir, he's 20 points down."" ""Wait a minute. He was 20 points up. What are you talking about?"" ""No, sir, right now he's 20 points down. He's getting killed."" I said, ""Why?"" ""Because he wanted to terminate preexisting conditions."" Well, that was a poll."
01:05:16 - 01:05:59 (43 sec),"This is a guy, he ended up getting clobbered. He had an easy race. He was already buying the carpet for the mansion. Not our mansion, a different mansion. I guess that didn't work out too well. And I'll never forget, five governors sitting in front of me, I was making a speech, very conservative governors, and I said, because I hadn't really taken a position and, but I -- I think we have to go with the preexisting, and I'm making a speech, ""And we will support, and the Republicans cherish preexisting conditions."" And these five Southern guys down there, they're looking me, ""What the hell was that all about?"
01:05:59 - 01:06:19 (21 sec),"What?"" And I told him, I said, ""We have to support it. We should support it. We're doing the right thing. And if you don't support it, you have no chance of winning. I mean, I just want to be blunt, you have no chance of winning."" The Democrat plan will be devastating to the people with preexisting conditions."
01:06:19 - 01:07:22 (63 sec),"We have great talking points. The Republican Party will be the champion of preexisting conditions. You have to do it. Some of you like it, some of you don't, but you're going to have to like. Not only for politics, it's the right thing. We want to be the party of great health care. I am, right now, working with people, and here's the key to all of it, I'm right now working with people in this room, knowledgeable leaders in Congress and with experts in the administration, I have a couple of people, one in particular who is a total health care genius, this person knows more about healthcare and loves the subject, loves it, to come up with a great health care plan that is far less costly to the people, not to the government, to the people."
01:07:22 - 01:07:45 (23 sec),"Far less costly than Obamacare with the deductibles that are far lower. The deductibles are so high that nobody gets to use it unless you're in serious condition so serious that, frankly, the last thing on your mind is health care. I will be asking that this be my first vote immediately after the election."
01:07:45 - 01:08:06 (21 sec),"We are going to regain the House because of health care and other things, the border, the military, the police. They're for open borders and crime. We're for great borders and merit-based immigration, merit-based, so they can help our country and help our companies that are all moving into our country and need people to work."
01:08:06 - 01:08:31 (25 sec),"We're going to keep the Senate and we're going to keep the presidency and we're going to bring back the House. So essentially, what I'm saying is we're going to come up with a health care plan. We're not going to vote on it until after the election. We'll all promise it's going to be our first vote because we blew it the last time."
01:08:31 - 01:08:55 (24 sec),"Man, I was fed a bill of goods. I want to tell you, some of you, I'm still a little bit angry, but not all of you. Wasn't even your fault. But we should have done it when we had the position. But we're going to get it back and it's got to be a better plan. So we're going to give a great health care plan."
01:08:55 - 01:09:23 (28 sec),"And we're going to go and campaign on that plan with the understanding that if we win it's going to be much less expensive than Obamacare and much more usable in terms of deductibles. And what's going to happen is we're going to promise the people that if you vote for us and if they vote for you, all of you running, that we're going to vote for this."
01:09:23 - 01:09:49 (26 sec),"It's going to happen but we have to get back the House. You know what? You're going to win back the House. I think it's going to be one of the strongest things you have because people don't like Obamacare. We forgot about it. We had a very, very unfortunate vote by somebody. We were close. We were so close."
01:09:49 - 01:10:04 (15 sec),"One vote away. One vote away. But it didn't work. But this is going to be something, I think, that has even more potential. It's going to be a better plan. I already know what they're doing with it. And we're going to -- we're going to use it. We're going to campaign on that plan. And it's so much better than Obamacare."
01:10:04 - 01:10:23 (20 sec),"Now, here's your alternative, turn off whatever they talk about health care. ""I don't want to talk about it. Oh, it's a bad -- "" because, you know, I know it's a tough subject. But we have a great advantage here. And we vote right after the election. It's going to get a lot of people elected and you're going to be doing the right thing."
01:10:23 - 01:10:41 (18 sec),"Additionally, we'll be knocking the Democrats Socialistic, single payer health care plan with all of the disasters floors, including all of those great Americans that are going to lose their plan. Remember, ""You can have your doctor. You could have your plan."" I mean, so many lies, so many lies. So you're going to be campaigning against very negative things."
01:10:41 - 01:11:05 (24 sec),"You're going to win your elections because of health care. And a lot of people were upset with me because I announced this like a week ago, and I didn't want to waste my time by calling people. I didn't want to call the leaders, other than Kevin. I'd be afraid to call Kevin. But I didn't call people. They said, ""What?"
01:11:05 - 01:11:33 (28 sec),"What? I don't know anything about it."" I blame myself a little bit. But now they love it. They really like it. You're going to get elected because of it and you're going to be doing the right thing. It's a great incentive for the voters to vote for you. So instead of when they ask you a health care question and say, ""I'd -- I'd rather not answer that question."" ""But what about preexisting -- "" ""Ah, ah, Alice, take me home, Alice."
01:11:33 - 01:11:59 (27 sec),"They're asking me about preexisting -- Alice, please take me home."" And then you get clobbered. You got a plan that's a much better plan. And it's going to be your first vote when you get back to Washington. The radical Democrats are also aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth, right."
01:11:59 - 01:12:20 (21 sec),"Whoever heard of this stuff? I had it in the debate. I never use the term ripped. It was my term. And people that had been working on this on our side for years said it was an incredible moment. I didn't know about -- I didn't use that term. I never heard of that term. I thought of it during the debate, because Hillary Clinton was so staunch on abortion and rights of abortion."
01:12:20 - 01:12:41 (21 sec),"And I said, ""According to Hillary, in the ninth month you can rip -- "" that's where it came up. Does anybody remember that debate? They say that was like a big moment. You can rip the baby out of the womb and kill the baby. But now it's gotten worse. Because this maniac, the governor from Virginia, he comes up and says, ""Now the baby is born."
01:12:41 - 01:13:11 (30 sec),"And you wrap the baby gently and then you talk to the mother and dependent on what the mother says you execute the baby."" Can you imagine, whoever heard of it? I never even heard of this one. I've heard of ninth month, which is horrible. I've heard of fifth month and fourth month, but this is the baby is now born and the mother will make a decision as to whether or not that baby will be, essentially, executed."
01:13:11 - 01:13:30 (19 sec),"And he said that. He said that. And he said some other things that were unrelated to that which were bad. And believe it or not, which were covered even more so than that, which I couldn't believe that it was. His other thing, you know what that was, was covered more importantly in the media than that. And what can be more important than that?"
01:13:30 - 01:13:48 (18 sec),"That's why I've called on Congress to pass legislation banning the late-term abortion of children who can feel the pain in their mother's womb. And, you know, it's always been a very close issue. It's been for many, many years. It's been a 50/50 issue. I don't know if you saw, it was so horrible and so extreme what the Democrats in New York, you saw what was happening, they're all applauding."
01:13:48 - 01:14:11 (22 sec),"It was so horrible, so horrible, that you gained 11 points in the poll. This is the first time it's no longer -- it was a 49-51 issue for many, many -- for decades. It never really changed. It would go from 51-49 back and forth. You just picked up 11 points because of how extreme that was. It was so terrible."
01:14:11 - 01:14:27 (16 sec),"Democrats are the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, hoaxes, delusions. Whenever House Democrats are ready to abandon their extremism the Republicans here tonight are ready to work with them to deliver a much better future for all of our citizens. We're willing to work together."
01:14:27 - 01:14:54 (27 sec),"I told Nancy Pelosi the other day, I was with her, it was a nice conversation. Unfortunately, every time we have a great conversation she then goes out and does a news conference and she says I'm a terrible human being. I don't figure that but I guess that's called politics. Every day we're restoring America's strength at home and we are restoring our nation's standing all over this world."
01:14:54 - 01:15:16 (22 sec),"Two years ago ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. I was told that it would take at least two years from one month ago to get the Caliphate at 100 percent. You saw that. My generals, that I got rid of, told me it would take two years to get two percent. I went to Iraq."
01:15:16 - 01:15:57 (41 sec),"I stayed in the White House for almost four months. The only time I left was to go to Iraq. I'll tell you, if you have to get cabin fever getting cabin fever in the White House is still a good place. But I went to Iraq and I met the generals and one general said, ""Sir, we can do it in one week."" I said, ""Wait a minute, they said two years."" They said, ""That's because we're hitting them at a much different level."" And we did it and we now have 100 percent of the ISIS -- it's been completely obliterated."
01:15:57 - 01:16:18 (21 sec),"And that doesn't mean you don't have cells and these crazy people, I got to say it, because you saw it, you can never say, ""We won,"" because if you say, ""We won,"" and then somebody blows up a store, some crazy maniac. But we just beat the hell out of them. And we're trying to now beat them at the Internet because there's nobody better at the Internet than them."
01:16:18 - 01:16:42 (24 sec),"I don't know if you saw recently I put some social media that they're losers, that they're dead. That if you join them you will be killed just like they're killed. We got to beat them at their own game, folks. It's not a very nice game. And they don't surrender. When we had them, I was telling Kevin McCarthy, when we had them four or five days ago, they were cornered."
01:16:42 - 01:17:08 (26 sec),"They don't know what it is to be cornered because they always had free reign. They're not -- they don't have free reign with me. And we flew over with brand new F-18s, Super Hornets, and they're going 2,000 miles an hour over and over for two days. And I said, ""Do these people ever like wave the flag? Do they ever surrender?"" And the General Raisin Cane, his name?"
01:17:08 - 01:17:45 (37 sec),"What's your first name? You know this. ""Sir my first name is Raisin."" This guy's out of central casting, I'm telling you. There's nobody in Hollywood that could look like this guy because he's much tougher. That I can tell you. I said, ""What's your name?"" ""Raisin."" ""What's your last name?"" ""Cane."" I said, ""You mean your name is Raisin Cane?"" ""Yes, sir."" That's the guy that told me. I said, ""So, my people tell me two years."
01:17:45 - 01:18:07 (21 sec),"What do you think?"" ""One week, sir."" I said, ""General, come here. Give me a kiss."" I felt like Joe Biden. But I meant it. See, I meant it, big difference. I meant it. So we knocked them out. And we now have knocked them out. And we have -- but I always say you have some crazy people around, nevertheless."
01:18:07 - 01:18:24 (18 sec),"Together, we're also fully rebuilding the American Armed Forces -- and you're doing that, what you're doing is incredible. Because without that the other things might not matter. It's a rough time of this world. I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal -- and Iran is a different country."
01:18:24 - 01:18:56 (32 sec),"When I first came here, Iran was going to take over the Middle East and there was no stopping him. And I took out of that deal. I terminated that deal and they have gone to hell. That's a different country. They have riots. Their economy is collapsed. It was a horrible, stupid deal. We gave them $150 billion and they used it to fight us. We gave them $1.8 billion in cash, airplane loads of cash."
01:18:56 - 01:19:16 (20 sec),"And I recognized the capital of Israel and we opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem for a $1 billion under budget. $1 billion under budget. We were going to spend $1 billion to build it. I got it done for $400,000. Think of that. So I saved $1 billion. I took a building that we already owned on land that we already owned."
01:19:16 - 01:19:43 (27 sec),"Somebody said, ""What's the difference between that piece of land and the piece that we were going to spend a fortune to buy?"" I said, ""The difference is it's much better. It's a better location. It's a much bigger site."" Other than that, they were very similar. And to support Israel's security just last week, and this has been going on for 58 years, I recognized fully Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights."
01:19:43 - 01:20:08 (25 sec),"58 years, they've been talking. They've had committees, they've had meetings, they've had 32 different meetings and it's talk and they never do it. So we did it. And I'll tell you what, I don't know about the United States, I think we're doing well, but I can run for the prime minister of Israel. That's what they tell me. I think I've been 90 -- I think I'm at 98 percent in Israel."
01:20:08 - 01:20:36 (28 sec),"You'd better be careful, I'll leave here and I'll go run in Israel. The United States has also taking decisive action against the brutal Socialist dictatorship in Venezuela. That's a horrible situation. And America, once again, stands with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, in their righteous struggle for freedom and we're helping them out."
01:20:36 - 01:20:56 (20 sec),"So we're gathered here tonight at a very pivotal moment in our nation's history. That's true. This is a very important moment. You know, we have forces going against this country from within that can destroy this country. If we lose this election -- You know, when I go out to make a speech I meet people."
01:20:56 - 01:21:18 (22 sec),"I don't get to see too many people, but I meet people backstage going on. And they'd say to me, ""Thank you, sir, for saving our country."" They're talking to all of us, by the way. ""Thank you, sir."" A man came up to me a week ago. We were in Michigan. We had a tremendous crowd in Michigan. Right? Is that right?"
01:21:18 - 01:21:45 (27 sec),"That's a good group. Great crowd. And this guy looked like he never cried in his life. He looked like football player, a big strong guy and he was pouring down tears as I'm getting ready to speak. I'm walking by and he was there and he said, ""Sir, thank you for saving our country."" And I used to be surprised because I've been hearing this for a year and a half, I used to be surprised."
01:21:45 - 01:22:16 (31 sec),"You know, it's a big statement and they're oftentimes crying. And they're people that don't cry. These are not criers. These are people that are real stalwarts, not crying. Nothing wrong with crying, but they often are crying. And I've heard it so much. We have an election coming up that if something bad should happen with this election we could lose the country, we really could, because these people are stone cold crazy."
01:22:16 - 01:22:41 (25 sec),"What they want to do to our country would be overwhelming. It would be horrible. So we have no choice, we have to win. We really have to win. Now, it could be the start moving in a different direction, but I don't think so. It looks like they're only moving one way. The majority of American people support our common sense agenda."
01:22:41 - 01:23:05 (24 sec),"And Americans do not want to risk their prosperity or our prosperity. They don't want to risk their children's future. They don't want to risk their wealth. They don't want to risk their 401ks, where they're up 50, 60, 70, 80 percent. I talk about it all the time. They feel like financial geniuses. They've never been there before."
01:23:05 - 01:23:31 (26 sec),"And we're going to explain to them that your 401k will disappear. You're not going to have anything. We have a lot of great things going. So the Democrat program of radical Socialism and open borders, if we are good, and if we are smart, and if we do our job, it cannot work. It's not going to work. Because our people are doing too well."
01:23:31 - 01:23:51 (21 sec),"The choice has never been clearer, the Republican Party is the party for all Americans. We really are. We have changed this party so dramatically, folks. I -- I say all of us, not just me. I've been -- I've been important. You've been just as important. We're now the party of the American worker. Did you ever hear?"
01:23:51 - 01:24:21 (30 sec),"When I started doing this we were like the party of the rich person and we will losing and there were not enough rich people. We're now the party of the American family and we're the party of the American dream. It's true, you are. In South Carolina, when I was going against a lot of different people, there were 12 people left, and I'll never forget somebody came down and said, ""You have no idea what you've done."
01:24:21 - 01:24:41 (20 sec),"Thousands and tens of thousands of people are joining the Republican Party. This has never happened."" They've never seen it before. And this happened in New Hampshire. It happened to all over. It happens in Florida. It's happening now in Florida. I mean, I don't like to talk about leads to early, but we have an incredible lead in the state of Florida."
01:24:41 - 01:25:12 (31 sec),"We have an incredible lead in the state of Ohio. We have a great lead in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in South Carolina. I mean, we have leads. Now, you always have to be very careful because you have, on occasion, seen leads disappear, but we're not going to let that happen. Because we have the far better ideas, the far better platform, and I know many of the people in this room, we have the far better and more talented people."
01:25:12 - 01:25:48 (36 sec),"You are the people I'm talking about. And we believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe in religious liberty. The right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms."
01:25:48 - 01:26:14 (26 sec),"We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we believe in the words of our national motto, ""In God We Trust"". We're not going to lose that. We're not going to lose that. People want to play with that. They're not playing with that one."
01:26:14 - 01:26:50 (36 sec),"They want to play with that, you know that. We're not playing with that one. ""In God We Trust"". We fight on behalf of hardworking citizens who pay their taxes, follow our laws, raise their children, protect our communities, and made this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth. And we're doing better now than we've done in decades, and decades, and decades."
01:26:50 - 01:27:23 (33 sec),"This land is our home. These American patriots have always been loyal to our country and we will forever be loyal to them, forever. Every day for the next 19 months we will keep on fighting, we will keep on working, and we will keep on winning, winning, winning for the American people -- and for yourselves, and for yourselves, and your families."
01:27:23 - 01:28:11 (48 sec),"With your help, on November 3rd 2020 Republicans are going to win the House, we are going to win the Senate, and we are going to, again, win the White House. Thank you. And together with the love, prayers, and devotion of everyone in this really warm and incredible room, and millions of patriots across our land, we are going to Make America Great Again."
01:28:11 - 01:28:31 (20 sec),"We are going to make America greater than it's ever been before. And we are going to do it not just for you, not just for your friends, we are going to do it for all Americans. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you, everybody."
00:00:00 - 00:00:29 (29 sec),"We love that song, but let's get going. Right? I want to thank you all, and I want to thank, especially, Melania -- she works so hard -- and those moving words, even though it is from your wife, so she's maybe a little bit prejudiced in that way. But I will say that she is a hard worker and has a profound commitment to building a drug-free future for America's children."
00:00:29 - 00:00:59 (30 sec),"We're going to do it too. We're going to do it. Made a lot of progress. Today, I'm honored to join the thousands of leaders -- and that's what you are: leaders -- from across the country for the 2019 Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. Very important. Everyone here today is united by the same vital goal: to liberate our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction and to end the opioid crisis once and for all."
00:00:59 - 00:01:34 (35 sec),"It's happening. It's happening. That's happening. I want to recognize the founder of Operation UNITE for his unwavering community service, for his incredible commitment, and to address this critical issue: Congressman Hal Rogers. A friend of mine for a long time. And I want to thank you very much, Hal, wherever you may be. Thank you."
00:01:34 - 00:02:00 (26 sec),"Thank you, Hal. Good job. Very dedicated guy. We're also grateful to Operation UNITEâs President and CEO, Nancy Hale. Thank you, Nancy. And thanks also to an outstanding public servant, a man who works day and night. No matter when I need him, he's there. I'll call him at the strangest hours."
00:02:00 - 00:02:24 (24 sec),"He's always there working. Secretary Alex Azar. It's really great, Alex, what you're doing. Thank you. And CDC Administrator, Dr. Robert Redfield, who is helping us to eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2030. And we're there; we're going to be able to do that. People are shocked. Please, stand up, Doctor. So important."
00:02:24 - 00:02:48 (24 sec),"I said that recently in a speech: We will eradicate AIDS by 2030. We've made such incredible progress. And they didnât know what I was talking about. They couldnât believe it. They came up to me after the speech, Doctor. They said, ""Do you mean that?"" That's right -- we're going to have it eradicated by 2030. Thank you very much, Doctor."
00:02:48 - 00:03:10 (22 sec),"Very important. Also with us is the Lieutenant Governor of this great state, a friend of mine and a man who -- he's worked so hard with Brian. The combination of Jeff Duncan and Brian has been pretty much unbeatable. They're doing a fabulous job. Jeff, thank you very much. Jeff, where are you? Jeff? Jeff, thank you."
00:03:10 - 00:03:36 (27 sec),"Stand up, Jeff. Great job. Really great job. And, Mrs. Duncan, thank you very much. And the Georgia Attorney General, Chris Carr. Chris, thank you. Tough guy. And he's in there fighting for us. I know that. As well as members of Congress: Rick Allen, Drew Ferguson, Barry Loudermilk, and Jody Hice."
00:03:36 - 00:04:02 (26 sec),"We have them all. We have them all. Thatâs a pretty unbeatable group. Weâve been doing okay together, havenât we? Huh? Weâve been doing good. To all of the people in this room who serve every day on the frontiers and frontlines of this crisis -- and a crisis it is -- you have earned the gratitude of our entire nation."
00:04:02 - 00:04:33 (31 sec),"You may not even know it, but our nation loves you and they love what youâre doing. Thank you very much. You are the first responders who bring patients back to life. You are the law enforcement officers who bring drug traffickers to justice. You are the doctors, nurses, and counselors who give struggling citizens the hope and solace and strength to build a brighter and brighter future."
00:04:33 - 00:05:05 (32 sec),"And you are the families and faith communities who help thousands of Americans overcome addiction for a new life of freedom. My administration is deploying every resource at our disposal to empower you, to support you, and to fight right by your side. And thatâs what weâre doing. We will not solve this epidemic overnight, but we will stop -- thereâs just nothing going to stop us, no matter how you cut it. I know some of the people in this room."
00:05:05 - 00:05:30 (25 sec),"Nothing stops you. Nothing stops you, I can tell you. We will never stop until our job is done, and then maybe weâll have to find something new. And I hope thatâs going to be soon. But we will succeed. We have results that are unbelievable; numbers that I heard, two weeks ago, that I was shocked to hear."
00:05:30 - 00:05:56 (26 sec),"Weâre making tremendous progress. Each year, more than 70,000 precious American lives are lost to the opioid and drug crisis. And, in my opinion, the number is much higher than that. To protect all Americans, my administration declared the opioid epidemic a nationwide public health emergency. A big step."
00:05:56 - 00:06:36 (40 sec),"Since then, we have secured a record $6 billion in new funding to combat the opioid crisis, and thatâs the most ever. And weâre going for even bigger numbers this year. Last year, we provided $90 million to prevent youth substance abuse, and I signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act -- the largest-ever legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in our nationâs history."
00:06:36 - 00:07:13 (37 sec),"Itâs the largest ever. Following the recommendation of my Surgeon General and many others, last year the distribution of the overdose-reversing drug, naloxone, increased by over one million units. Pretty amazing stuff. To expand access to treatment, recovery, and other crucial activities and services, all throughout our nation we have given opioid response grants to states, totaling a record $2 billion."
00:07:13 - 00:07:35 (22 sec),"We are now allowing states to use Medicaid funds to pay for residential treatment facilities, and theyâre being built all over the country. In my first year in office, the number of patients receiving medication-assisted treatment at community health centers increased by 64 percent. No other President did that."
00:07:35 - 00:08:31 (56 sec),"No other President. We have no choice. We have no choice. We passed the CRIB Act to expand treatment for mothers and their babies who are born physically dependent on opioids. For our nationâs veterans, we are improving pain management, with over 43,000 fewer veterans on opioids since January 2017. Think of that -- 43,000. Twenty-three thousand [Forty-three thousand]. And, by the way, for the veterans, 45 years theyâve been trying to get it. As you know, just recently, I signed Veterans Choice, where a veteran can go, and if the wait is going to be days or weeks or months -- which it used to be -- they go out and see a private doctor."
00:08:31 - 00:09:02 (31 sec),"Take immediate care. We pay for it. We take care of it. And it's been an incredible -- it's new and it's been incredible, the difference it's made. And just months ago, I signed bipartisan criminal justice reform into law. Among other critical changes, the FIRST Step Act provides addiction treatment to Americans in prison."
00:09:02 - 00:09:43 (41 sec),"And I'm pleased to report that, in just four months, more than 16,000 inmates are participating in new drug treatment. And criminal justice reform -- I have to say, people are getting out of prison. And since our founding, they were having an impossible time getting a job. But because our economy is doing so well, perhaps the best it's ever been in our history -- best unemployment numbers in history, best everything."
00:09:43 - 00:10:07 (24 sec),"Because of this -- because of this, prisoners getting out are signing in; they're getting jobs. And I can tell you that those employers -- because I speak to a lot of them -- are thrilled. They had no idea. I'm so proud of that. So, the great economy has made it much easier. They get out, and then they have to prove themselves."
00:10:07 - 00:10:26 (19 sec),"They never got a chance to prove themselves. Now they prove themselves, and they are doing a spectacular job. Not all of them, but there's nothing ""all"" about any of us. But they are doing a spectacular job. So I want to thank all of you. And I want to thank -- Congressman, I want to thank you for helping me with that, because you were very instrumental."
00:10:26 - 00:10:52 (26 sec),"Thank you very much. Thank you. The Department of Labor is expanding federal efforts to help recovering Americans find a great job in our soaring economy. As a result of our historic economic boom also, we are lifting up all Americans from all walks of life, including those who have endured the pain of addiction."
00:10:52 - 00:11:09 (17 sec),"They're getting a second and third and, in some cases, a fourth chance. And they're making it. They're making it. And they really have something to live for. Some of them say, ""We love getting up in the morning. We love going to work. We love our job."" And if they don't like the job because of what's happened, it's a miracle."
00:11:09 - 00:11:35 (26 sec),"All over the world, they're talking about what's happened with our economy. If they don't like their job, they have choice also, like the vets. They have choice. It's choice of going out and finding a different job that they like better. Big impact. Last year, a record 73 percent of the new jobs went to people who were out of the workforce and are now coming back to work for the first time in many years."
00:11:35 - 00:12:03 (28 sec),"And these newly employed citizens are joining 5.5 million more workers who have found jobs since the election, driving our national unemployment rate to its lowest level in 51 years. And, as you know, and you've heard me say it, African American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country."
00:12:03 - 00:12:30 (26 sec),Asian American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country. Hispanic American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country. People that graduate without a high school diploma -- it's a big group -- lowest in the history of our country. Women -- sorry -- lowest in 61 years. [Laughter] But we'll soon have the record.
00:12:30 - 00:12:55 (25 sec),"We will soon have the record. We're going to have that record, too. We're all Americans. We are all one family. And we know that we are strongest when no one is left behind. My administration is committed to ensuring that every citizen can live with dignity and purpose and proudly pursue the American Dream."
00:12:55 - 00:13:43 (48 sec),"Critical to this effort is my administrationâs strong support for faith-based initiatives. America is a nation that believes in the power of prayer and the strength of fellowship, and we believe in the grace of God. And we're proud of it. Here with us today is Dr. Monty Burks. Nineteen years ago, Monty turned his life around when two women of prayer from his hometown church helped him to get on a path to recovery."
00:13:43 - 00:14:08 (25 sec),"Now Monty works for Tennesseeâs -- what a great state -- Department of Mental Health and is Director of their Faith-Based Recovery Initiative. Monty, please, come up and tell us a little bit about your work."
00:14:08 - 00:14:33 (25 sec),"In awe, honor, and humbled. The opposite of addiction is relationship. That simple equation is what helped me find my freedom. Criminal justice intervention led me to treatment, which led me to recover, which put me on this podium. I've been blessed to serve under Commissioner Williams -- and Commissioner Varney past before."
00:14:33 - 00:14:48 (15 sec),"They took a chance on a broken and bruised person who had been touched by the system, but they knew that I had a purpose, and my purpose was to use the pain that I'd went through to help other people not have to go through the same thing that I'd went through. You see, recovery is real. We do recover. We do recover."
00:14:48 - 00:15:17 (29 sec),"To me, the paradigm shifts with the faith community. Our governor, Bill Lee, supports the faith-based community being the catalyst to change, to control the narrative, to explain how people and recovery can come back and be fruitful and change the paradigm themselves, in their own communities."
00:15:17 - 00:15:38 (21 sec),"Employers trust the faith community. We go back to work not just for a job but for a career, so we can go back and lead as peers so those who were behind us crying in the wilderness will have a second chance to stand before a podium like this and tell you that, yes, recovery is real. We do recover."
00:15:38 - 00:16:06 (27 sec),"Secretary Azar, I want to thank you for your work with HHS and the Office of Faith-Based with Shannon Royce and Heidi. And they spread the word and the message about faith-based recovery and treatment across the state. Today, this is my pulpit, and I have to say this: Someone in a program hears me right now and says, ""I can, because you did."
00:16:06 - 00:16:20 (14 sec),"I can, because he did."" That's right. Yes, you can. Look in the mirror. There is your miracle. I want to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me this space to stand beside you. I want to thank God for you and the First Lady and your support of the recovery community. Thank you."
00:16:20 - 00:17:11 (51 sec),"Wow, that's great, Monty. And he had this beautiful speech written down in his iPhone -- this is the new way of doing it -- [Laughter] -- and he never looked at it once. [Laughter] That's a pretty good job. Thank you very much, Monty. Appreciate it. Fantastic. My administration has also embarked on an unprecedented effort to shut down online criminal networks, crack down on illegal international shipments, and stop the deadly flow of drugs into our country."
00:17:11 - 00:17:37 (26 sec),"In the past two years, Customs and Border Protection seizures of meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl at the southern border are up 45 percent and going up much higher. We are seizing it all over. You probably saw the numbers today. We are detaining, capturing -- call it anything you want -- more people than ever before."
00:17:37 - 00:18:07 (30 sec),"Some of those people are not people we want in our country. And I will say Border Patrol has been incredible. There's never been a march up that border like there is today, up throughout Mexico. Mexico is starting to detain and bring back to their country, where they came from. But a lot of it is drugs, and drugs are being gotten by us. We are stopping the drug flow as much as we can."
00:18:07 - 00:18:27 (20 sec),"Soon, we're going to have a wall that's going to be a very powerful wall. It's under construction. The media doesnât like talking about it. The media doesnât like talking about it. It's one of many things we're doing. But when that wall is finished, we intend to have almost 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year."
00:18:27 - 00:18:52 (25 sec),"We're probably ahead of schedule a little bit. That'll have a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country. And we have many other things, including the finest equipment that that you can buy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the best drug detection equipment you can have. And I always say this: Because as good as that equipment is -- and itâs genius -- the greatest equipment in the world is a dog."
00:18:52 - 00:19:13 (22 sec),"Dogs -- a certain type of German Shepherd in particular. Dogs do a better job than 400 million dollars' worth of equipment. Can you believe that? Only the dog lover would understand that, right? No, it's true. I said to the Border Patrol the other day -- they were giving me a little bit of a rundown on the equipment."
00:19:13 - 00:19:32 (18 sec),"And, you know, itâs hundreds -- weâre close to 500 million dollars' worth of equipment at the ports of entry. I said, âHow does this compare to those great dogs I saw?â They say, âSir, honestly, the dogs are better.â [Laughter] I said, âYou got to be kidding.â Itâs incredible, and they showed me, and itâs actually incredible."
00:19:32 - 00:19:57 (25 sec),"But we also have a lot of dogs, and theyâre great dogs, and we cherish them. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which enters our country through our southern border. Weâre doing everything to empower ourselves so that we can keep this poison out of our communities and away from our children."
00:19:57 - 00:20:17 (20 sec),"You're going to see some very, very big differences in the coming months. Weâre capturing people that you wouldnât believe. And if you remember, when I announced that famous run, when I came down -- Iâm sure nobody saw this. When I came down the escalator with Melania and her white dress -- I donât think anybody saw that -- [Laughter] -- but I made a very strong statement about the border and I was criticized."
00:20:17 - 00:21:04 (47 sec),"They said, âOh, itâs not that bad.â Well, let me tell you, that statement was peanuts compared to reality. Peanuts. It was small-time, compared to reality. But we are confronting reality and confronting the grave security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border. And thatâs why Iâve declared a national emergency, which is exactly what it is. And weâve secured historic funding to strengthen border security, including the equipment, including the wall, including more Border Patrol agents -- including many other things that you donât even have to know about and some you donât want to know about."
00:21:04 - 00:21:37 (33 sec),"Congress must also act to fix, however, our horrible, obsolete, weak, pathetic immigration laws. We could solve the entire problem -- I say â45 minutes,â but it could go a lot quicker than that; letâs bring it down to 15 minutes -- if the Democrats would agree to do certain basic, commonsense things with respect to our laws."
00:21:37 - 00:21:55 (18 sec),"And I do think that thereâs pressure being put on them, and I think that some of them really do want to do the right thing. Iâve spoken to some recently, and you might be surprised at whatâs going to happen. But they see whatâs going on at the border. Itâs very easy to see. And theyâre seeing the drugs and theyâre seeing the human trafficking."
00:21:55 - 00:22:16 (20 sec),"The human trafficking has -- itâs like never before in our history. And this is a world problem, and itâs happening all over the world, but for us, itâs through the southern border. Today, weâre grateful to be joined by Virginia State Police Senior Special Agent Tom Murphy, who has been chasing down drug traffickers for decades."
00:22:16 - 00:22:50 (34 sec),"In recent years, he has seen a surge of cheap heroin being trafficked from Mexico, which is now being laced with ultra-lethal fentanyl. Tragically, a year and a half ago, Special Agent Murphyâs own son died from an overdose of this kind of deadly drug. And it is deadly. Special Agent Murphy, Americaâs heart breaks for you and for all of the families that have suffered so needlessly."
00:22:50 - 00:23:10 (21 sec),"No other family should have to experience the pain and the sorrow that youâve endured. Would you please come up to say a few words? Please, Special Agent. Thank you."
00:23:10 - 00:23:35 (24 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President and First Lady, for this time and opportunity to speak. Both professionally and personally, Hal has touched my life and my familyâs life. I worked for the State Police of Virginia for 31 years, assigned to a narcotics division drug enforcement section for 23 of those 31 years. I sat in your seat four years ago, at this same conference."
00:23:35 - 00:24:08 (34 sec),"While I was here four years ago, my son Jason was battling drug addiction. His story is one thatâs all too common today. He grew up with ADD, depression, and was medicated at a young age. Prior to 18 years old, he started self-medicating with marijuana. He knew at 18 years old he had to move out of the house because Dad is Dad, and Dad is a police officer, and you canât do that at home."
00:24:08 - 00:24:34 (26 sec),"Well, on his 18th birthday -- on the day he turned 18 -- he moved out of our home. He would later tell me it's the worst decision he's ever made in his life. When he did so, about a year or two later, he had a work-related injury where he severed four fingers from his hand. He was introduced to opioids, which was my greatest fear."
00:24:34 - 00:25:12 (38 sec),"I would see him around town, and my wife -- you could his physical decline. He'd been arrested a couple of times for possession and distribution to continue his habit. Twelve days before Christmas -- December 13th, 2017, 12 days before Christmas, he passed away of a heroin and fentanyl overdose."
00:25:12 - 00:25:52 (40 sec),"People talk about stigma associated with opioids, heroin, drugs. There is a stigma, and the stigma needs to stop. If you want to think about stigma, think about a family that's been though it professionally and personally. And my family has. And that's only one family of 70,000 in 2017 who lost a loved one because of opioids and heroin."
00:25:52 - 00:26:21 (29 sec),"The stigma needs to stop. You need to share your story. I wear two bracelets every day since my son's death. On my right wrist is a purple bracelet to honor those who have fallen from drug overdose. It has his name on it and date and birth and date of death. On my left wrist, I have two: Thin Blue Line and I've got another one that simply states, ""Every overdose is someone's child. Don't judge. Educate."""
00:26:21 - 00:27:01 (39 sec),"So that's why we're here and that's why you're here. You took the first initiative, maybe, if you're here for the first time, to collaborate, to brainstorm, to strategize, to figure out this problem collectively. But the message I want to convey today is: Don't judge. There are 70,000 different stories that happened in 2017. You heard my son's. His name was Matthew Jason Murphy. Thank you."
00:27:01 - 00:28:13 (73 sec),"Thank you. You know, I think I can say with surety that your son, your boy, is looking down right now at you and he's very proud of his father. Very, very proud. Thank you. We are making great progress to stop fentanyl from coming into our communities. As a result of my negotiations with President Xi of China -- doing a very big trade deal -- they've announced that next week they will implement new measures to prevent Chinese fentanyl -- which is most of it; almost all fentanyl comes from China -- from being shipped to the United States."
00:28:13 - 00:28:42 (29 sec),"And furthermore -- and I appreciate this, from President Xi -- they've agreed that they're going to make it a major crime. It's not a crime now. It's down as an industrial drug. And they're going to make it a crime, and they're going to charge people with the highest level of crime. And, in China, unlike in our country, the highest level of crime is very, very high."
00:28:42 - 00:29:18 (36 sec),"It's the ultimate. You pay the ultimate price. So I appreciate that very much. Since I signed the STOP Act into law, our amazing Customs and Border Protection officers have stopped over six times more packages from reaching American doorsteps. It's a big deal. Right here, in Georgia, Customs and Border Protection officers at the seaport in Savannah recently discovered an estimated 19 million dollars' worth of cocaine in a shipment of Colombian pineapples."
00:29:18 - 00:29:47 (29 sec),"Today, we're proud to be joined by two officers who helped find those deadly drugs: James Long and Derrick Nobles. And thank you both for your courageous work. Where are you, folks? Where are you? Come on. Come on up here. Come up. Please."
00:29:47 - 00:30:04 (17 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you all for having us here, first of all. And again, thank you for all your support. It's been a -- it's been a long road, and we're glad to have the President behind us. I'm glad to have you all behind us on the law enforcement side and the community itself, because you all are our biggest help with finding this."
00:30:04 - 00:30:10 (6 sec),"It's like finding a needle in the haystack, on most days. But again, thank you all every day for your support. Thank you."
00:30:10 - 00:30:39 (29 sec),"Thank you. Thank you both very much. Great job. So many incredible people that I've met doing exactly what you're doing. To all of the Customs and Border Protection officers, DEA agents, and state and local law enforcement that are here today: We love you, we support you, and we are with you all the way."
00:30:39 - 00:31:07 (28 sec),"All the way. You know, we had billions of dollars of military equipment, which the previous administration, for their own reason, was not willing to give up to law enforcement. And I decided that we will. This was beautiful, great, strong, powerful equipment, safety equipment. You know exactly what I'm talking about."
00:31:07 - 00:31:26 (19 sec),"And we gave billions and billions of dollars throughout the United States to law enforcement. And it's had a tremendous impact because -- I don't know if it's for that reason. Probably not. It's probably because of the great men and women involved. But the numbers are way down. Crime -- way down. So, thank you all very much."
00:31:26 - 00:32:03 (38 sec),"Appreciate it. My administration is also taking aggressive action to reduce the over-supply of highly addictive prescription drugs. The Department of Justice has prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in cases involving opioids. And earlier this week, the United States filed criminal charges against the sixth- largest drug wholesaler for illicit distribution of opioids -- because we are holding big pharma accountable."
00:32:03 - 00:32:30 (26 sec),They should be accountable. And they didn't give to my campaign. I don't want their money. [Laughter] They gave to a lot of other campaigns; that's the problem. But we are holding them -- I couldn't care less. They've got to do what's right. Doing a lot of things. We're also working very strong on drug pricing.
00:32:30 - 00:33:07 (37 sec),"It's coming way down. For the first time -- for the first time in 54 years, drug prices went down this year. They went down a little below even. That's a big thing. First time in 54 years. And I give great credit to you, Alex, for that. You and your whole group of wonderful people. Alex was a very, very successful executive at one of the biggest of the companies, and he understood the system better than anybody."
00:33:07 - 00:33:31 (24 sec),And we're lucky to have him. He has done an incredible job. Thank you very much. Many drug companies are giving European countries a better deal than they give their own country. And that has to stop. We've already informed them that's stopping. We are making sure that our great seniors on Medicare will share in the discounts given to other countries.
00:33:31 - 00:34:02 (31 sec),"And you know what that means. The sophisticates out there that do this for a living, you know exactly -- that's a big deal. Sounds like big deal, but it really is a big deal. At long last, we're stopping the drug companies and foreign countries from rigging the system -- I know all about the rigging the system because I had the system rigged on me. [Laughter and applause] I think you know what I'm talking about."
00:34:02 - 00:34:25 (23 sec),"Unfortunately, that will be your sound bite tonight, but that's okay. [Laughter] System was rigged. But rigging the system against our great seniors. And to help doctors and scientists develop non-addictive painkillers, we have nearly doubled funding for opioid and pain research. Thank you very much, Doctor."
00:34:25 - 00:34:58 (33 sec),"Come on. Stand. He gives away more money than any human being on Earth. Thank you. Great. Such an important -- if we can find that answer, that's going to be a big -- that's going to solve most of the problem, I suspect. How close are we? [Laughter] He's saying, ""Okay."" [Laughter] You'll get it. You'll get it. One year ago, we pledged to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third."
00:34:58 - 00:35:31 (33 sec),"Already during my time in office, we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent. That's a pretty amazing number. Pretty amazing. And I'm glad to report today that drug overdose deaths are down in the various states that we polled and checked -- the ones hardest hit by the opioid crisis: New Hampshire, West Virginia, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Ohio."
00:35:31 - 00:35:56 (25 sec),"And they're very steeply down in three of those cases. An amazing achievement. When I campaigned in those states, that was the biggest thing. And nobody would think it. Unless you're really involved, nobody would think it. Over the last two years, our National Prescription Drug Take Back Days have collected nearly 3.7 million pounds of prescription drugs."
00:35:56 - 00:36:31 (34 sec),"Thatâs seven times the weight of Air Force One -- a very nice plane that's parked about 10 minutes away. [Laughter] A very, very big, big, heavy plane. Think of that: seven times. And the next drug take back day is this Saturday. It's great. And finally, we know one of the most important steps to ending the opioid crisis is to prevent young people from ever using drugs in the first place."
00:36:31 - 00:37:07 (36 sec),"Our massive public awareness campaign about the horrific suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58 percent of young Americans. Where's Kellyanne? Kellyanne, stand up. Kellyanne Conway. She's done a great job. I keep saying, ""Kellyanne, where are those ads?"" Because, you know, if you do it properly -- and we've had some great ones, great ads -- young people looking at these ads, they won't start."
00:37:07 - 00:37:51 (44 sec),"I think, in many ways, you don't see the result for four or five years, but in many ways, that's one of the most important things we can be doing. So we're doing that and we're spending a lot of money on that. I think it's very important. When they look out, and somebody comes to them and wants to sell them drugs and they start thinking about what they just saw on television, or wherever they may have seen it, it's going to be a little harder for them to make that sale, and that's okay with me. It's the way we want it. And I'm very encouraged that in my first year in office, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 100,000 fewer teens started abusing prescription painkillers."
00:37:51 - 00:38:15 (25 sec),"One hundred thousand. Here with us today is Alex Elswick and his mom -- wonderful mom -- Shelley. As a young adult, Alex overcame addiction and is now -- with his mom, they founded an organization to help families in crisis. Alex and Shelley, would you come up and share your story? Thank you. Please."
00:38:15 - 00:38:24 (9 sec),"Well, good afternoon."
00:38:24 - 00:38:26 (2 sec),Go Cats!
00:38:26 - 00:38:57 (31 sec),"[Laughs] Go Cats. My name is Alex Elswick, and I'm a person in long-term recovery. And many of you already knew that, but perhaps what you didn't know is that this is my mom. And we're a family in long-term recovery. And I could tell you all about how my addiction was ""Groundhog Day"" in hell -- lived over and over and over again."
00:38:57 - 00:39:26 (29 sec),"But we've heard enough of death and destruction for a few years now. I'd rather tell you how grateful I am to be here and how grateful I am that I get to work every day alongside my mom and my friend, Amanda Fallin-Bennett, doing the work with Voices of Hope to help people in recovery stay in recovery. And I'd like to use this time to say a big ""thank you"" to every single individual in this room who works tirelessly every day to improve the lives of people like me. Because Monty said it best: We do recover and we recover together. So thank you all for being voices of hope."
00:39:26 - 00:40:20 (53 sec),"And thank you both. As Alex and Shelley remind us, our greatest resource in the fight against drugs is the heart and the might and the soul of the American people. We will prevail because of the courage, commitment, and compassion of heroes like all of you in this room today. You're incredible people. You are Americaâs true source of strength."
00:40:20 - 00:40:49 (30 sec),"So let us resolve that, together, we will support, cherish and care for our fellow citizens through every step and every challenge on their road to recovery. We will reach out to anyone who is hurting or lost or struggling, because every American deserves to know the glory of hope, the joy of belonging, and the blessings of healing."
00:40:49 - 00:41:22 (33 sec),"We will stand proudly behind our devoted doctors and nurses and medical professionals who work so hard, and they do so much. We will honor and celebrate the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you. We love our law enforcement. I don't know if you know it, but over the last two and half years, law enforcement has become hot."
00:41:22 - 00:41:48 (26 sec),"They were having a little problem, right? But they're hot. People are loving their law enforcement more than ever before because we respect you at the highest level. We respect you. And the job you do is incredible -- and dangerous -- but it's incredible. We will strive to give every child a loving home, and every home a thriving future."
00:41:48 - 00:42:18 (30 sec),"We will renew the bonds of family and faith that link us together as citizens, as patriots, and as Americans. We will not let up. We will not give in. And we will never, ever give up on saving American lives. We will end this terrible menace. We will smash the grip of addiction. We will make our cities safe, our communities strong, and our future brighter than ever before."
00:42:18 - 00:42:40 (22 sec),"As one united nation, we will work, we will pray, and we will fight for the day when every family across our land can live in a drug-free America. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:53 (54 sec),"Thank you very much, El Paso. Thank you very much. Thank you. I am very, very thrilled to be here in the great State of Texas -- right on the banks of the legendary Rio Grande, where by the -- well, I don't know, you heard, right? Today we started a big, beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande. Right smack on the Rio Grande."
00:00:53 - 00:01:53 (60 sec),"I love this state and I love the people of this state. We've had a great romance together. You know, that. It's been a great romance and we're only getting stronger together. That's what's happening. Wow, look at all the press back. You believe that? [Audience Boos] This is like the Academy Awards used to be, used to be. They've gone down a long way since they started hitting us a little bit, right?"
00:01:53 - 00:02:38 (45 sec),"They've gone down. That was a long -- that was a long fall, but there they are. Last week I was honored to stand in the House Chamber to deliver the State of the Union -- and I asked both parties to come together to choose greatness for America. Since taking office two years ago our economy is now the hottest economy anywhere on Earth."
00:02:38 - 00:03:16 (39 sec),"Our military, which desperately needed funding, we went $700 billion and $716 billion, is More powerful than ever before. That was not a good situation. It was tired and depleted. Our great warriors were not taken care of. Now they're taken care of again the way they should be. And America is winning again."
00:03:16 - 00:04:11 (54 sec),"Isn't that nice? We're fighting for all Americans, from all backgrounds of every age, race, religion, birthplace, color, creed. We're fighting for ourselves. We're fighting for all Americans. And what is it, America first? Remember, it's America first. [Audience chants USA] Our agenda is not a partisan agenda, although some people say it is. [Audience member calls out We love you] Every once in a while it does become that way."
00:04:11 - 00:04:53 (42 sec),"Right? It's a mainstream, common sense agenda of the American people. It's where we want to be and where we want to go. And despite the fact that the media refuses to acknowledge what we've done and how well we're doing it -- [Audience Boos] -- a new poll just came out as I was coming on and it shows -- I don't know how you can do this, I don't think I've had a good story in years. [Audience laughs]"
00:04:53 - 00:05:17 (24 sec),"I don't get good -- I used to get great press until I decided to run for office. And we have done together, an incredible job. And a new poll just came out today Rasmussen, one of the most respected polls, one of the polls that got the election right, so I have to remember that, you know what the number is, 52 percent, with no good news."
00:05:17 - 00:05:50 (33 sec),"Explain that. Explain that. Explain that. How do you get that when you don't get good press? I guess 93 percent of the stories are negative. No matter what we do, they figure out a way to make it bad. [Audience Boos] Like, I'll give you a quick example. When I came in, North Korea was -- it looks like it was going to war."
00:05:50 - 00:06:22 (31 sec),"You know that. It was going to happen, bad things. Now you have no missile launches. You have no rocket testing. You have no nuclear testing. I have a good relationship, maybe even a great relationship. We have tremendous sanctions on North Korea. But we have our hostages back. We have -- remains are coming back."
00:06:22 - 00:06:47 (25 sec),"Remains. And our presidents have been dealing with North Korea for many, many decades, many, many decades. And on a nuclear way over the last 20, 30 years and all I hear is, ""Can't you move faster?"" You know what? I left Singapore 15 months ago, they've been negotiating for 85 years or something. So now their complaint is, ""What's taking him so long?"" I heard one of our great geniuses from a previous administration telling me how to negotiate with North Korea when they got taken advantage of like nobody I've ever seen before. [Audience Boos]"
00:06:47 - 00:06:56 (9 sec),"So some day, with all of us, this is all of us -- and those hats are beautiful, by the way -- Someday -- True. Someday they're going to appreciate us all. And I'm going to Vietnam, to Hanoi, in the near future, 27th and 28th of February, to have another summit and hope we -- hopefully we do as well with the second summit as we did with the first."
00:06:56 - 00:07:07 (10 sec),"I hope so. Now, we're delighted and I'm delighted to be joined this evening by the Texas leaders. You have great leaders, great people, great help to me -- that are at the forefront of this incredible American Revolution. You know, there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. We have to understand."
00:07:07 - 00:07:28 (22 sec),"There's never been. If you would say, as an example, that tonight, 69,000 people signed up to be here. Now, the arena holes 8,000, and thank you fire department, they got in about 10, thank you fire department, appreciate it. But if you want to really see something go outside, tens of thousands of people are watching screens outside."
00:07:28 - 00:07:48 (19 sec),"Tens of thousands. And we were all challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz. [Audience Boos] And then they said, ""You know what? Hey, you're supposed to win in order to run. By the way, we, I, we, I'm one and one, I'm one for one. Think of it. We had one election, we won, now we're going to be 2 for 0 and everything's going to be perfect."
00:07:48 - 00:08:05 (18 sec),"But a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name, he has -- he challenged us. So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too good. In fact, what I do, what I would do is I would say, ""that may be the end of his presidential bid,"" but he did challenge us. So I want to introduce some great people."
00:08:05 - 00:08:35 (29 sec),"Your Governor, Greg Abbott. Greg. Where is he? Where's Greg? Thank you Greg. And a great governor and a great friend of mine. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Thanks Dan. Thank you Dan. Look at him in the corner, so shy. Thank you Dan. Great job, Dan. Attorney General Ken Paxton. Thanks, Ken. And Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller."
00:08:35 - 00:09:05 (30 sec),"Thank you, Sid. Thank you, everybody. Thanks, Ken. Great job you do. And we're especially grateful to your wonderful Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Great Senators. [Audience Chants USA] And we have a lot of your Congress men and women. We have a lot of them. Are you already? And they're terrific. And they've been with us all the way."
00:09:05 - 00:09:35 (30 sec),"Pete Olson. Pete. Thanks, Pete. Thank you, Pete. Michael Burgess. Thanks Michael. John Carter. Brian Babin. And Randy Weber. Thank you very much. We are in the midst of an economic miracle. That's what's happened. You look all over the world and you study and you see what's going on. You can look at China."
00:09:35 - 00:10:22 (47 sec),"We have a team right now in China, they want to make a deal very badly. Those tariffs are costing them a lot of money and they're going into our Treasury, remember that, we're filling up with billions of dollars. And did you see the, you know, I haven't been here very long, the trade deficit really went down very big this last month, and people are saying, ""Whoa."" I told you so. That's what I do. That's what I do. And we don't want China to have a hard time."
00:10:22 - 00:10:49 (27 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. I -- I can only tell you this, we're going to make great deals on trade. We're going to make great deals on military. When we defend another nation that's rich they have to help us out. Do we agree? They have to help us out. And they're doing it. They're doing it. You saw South Korea, they were paying us $500 million a year."
00:10:49 - 00:12:15 (86 sec),"I say you got to do more. You got to give more. Anyway. Now they're up to almost $900 million, that was like a do phone calls. I said -- I said, ""Why didn't they do this before?"" They said, ""Nobody ever asked. Nobody asked."" You pick up almost $500 million a year, nobody asked. We're defending rich countries, they've got to help us out, folks."
00:12:15 - 00:12:31 (16 sec),"They've got help us out, sorry. And you know what? They're going like us more and maybe more importantly, they going to respect us. Since the election, we have created 5.3 million new jobs, including more than a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing was dead? They said manufacturing was dead, the previous administration."
00:12:31 - 00:12:51 (20 sec),"You'll never have it. You need the magic wand. That's what they said. We obviously, we found the magic wand. And by the way, those numbers is small compared to what's happening, compared to all of the companies that are moving in. The unemployment -- [Audience Boos, chants USA] Thank you very much. Thank you."
00:12:51 - 00:13:18 (27 sec),"The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have reached the lowest level in the history of our country. [Audience chants Trump] Okay, thank you. Thank you. Are you all right? Everything okay? Please. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And women have filled almost 60 percent of the new jobs created last year, which were a record number."
00:13:18 - 00:13:41 (23 sec),"We passed massive tax cuts for working families and we canceled a record number of job killing regulations. That's why your oil and gas is coming back. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate. And to give critically ill patients access to life saving treatments, we did something that they haven't been able to do for a long time, we passed Right To Try."
00:13:41 - 00:14:07 (26 sec),"Right To Try. That's an incredible thing, Right To Try. You know, we have the greatest doctors and research in the world, and if somebody was terminally ill they traveled to Asia, they traveled to Europe, they'd travel all over the world, if they had the money. If they didn't have the money, they'd just go home, there was nothing they could do. And I said, ""Wait a minute."
00:14:07 - 00:14:30 (22 sec),"We have drugs in the pipeline that are showing tremendous progress. If somebody is terminally ill let's let them have access to our drugs. Let's let them have access."" And it's much tougher than you would think. But we got it and people, you will not understand, nobody understands, the lifesaving effects, it's incredible what's going on. They are getting better."
00:14:30 - 00:15:35 (65 sec),"People are getting better that were thinking they were going to die. It's right to try, I love it. I always wondered why we didn't do it before? Now, the people in Texas won't care much about this, but the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on Earth. I didn't think you'd care about that."
00:15:35 - 00:15:57 (22 sec),"I didn't think Texas would care about that. And listen to this, and Texas oil production is now at the highest level it's ever been. And only for the great oil professionals in the room, we're getting those pipelines approved so fast you'll be able to practically double up on oil production, oil and gas."
00:15:57 - 00:17:06 (69 sec),"They're getting approved at record levels and record time, that means more money, more security, and more independence for our country -- it's very simple. Another one they said could never get passed, they've been trying to do it for 40 years, we passed VA Choice, Veterans Choice. So that now, rather than waiting online for five days, for nine days, for three weeks -- [Audience Boos, Chants USA] Where do these people come from?"
00:17:06 - 00:17:34 (28 sec),"Where do they come from? They go back home to Mommy. They get punished when they get home. [Audience chants Build that wall] Now, you really mean finish that Wall, because we've built a lot it, steady and slowly. But before we get to the Wall, so VA Accountability and VA Choice. Accountability, we couldn't fire anybody from the Veterans Administration."
00:17:34 - 00:17:56 (22 sec),"We couldn't fire anybody. They could treat our veterans badly. We had to take it. Now, you get rid of them. And VA Choice, they'd wait online for days and weeks, they couldn't see a doctor. Now, they go out, they have a choice. They get a private doctor. They have things taken care of and we pay their bill."
00:17:56 - 00:18:29 (33 sec),"They've been trying to get those two things fixed for many, many decades, many years and we got it fixed. We also passed the Farm bill for wonderful farmers, ranchers, and growers. Just got it. We just got it passed and that was it easy but we got it passed. We had to do it. Our farmers are great. So we just get that done, farmers, ranchers, growers."
00:18:29 - 00:18:50 (21 sec),"And we passed historic legislation to combat the Opioid Crisis. [Audience chants Trump] Thank you. [Audience Boos, Audience chants hey, hey, hey, goodbye, as an audience member is removed from the coliseum] Thank you. Is there any place that's more fun to be that a Trump rally, is there any place? You know, they all said, ""Mr. President, we loved the tone of your State of the Union speech."" Some people said it was a great speech."
00:18:50 - 00:19:29 (39 sec),"Some people said, ""Really a great speech."" I said, ""But if I ever did that in El Paso, Texas, it wouldn't work here too well,"" do you agree? Nice and calm. No, that's not what you're looking for. This is more fun. This is more fun. And we just signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. Nobody thought that was going to be happening."
00:19:29 - 00:19:48 (19 sec),"In my address last week, I asked lawmakers in both parties to cross the aisle and join together for the common good for all Americans. Democrats have to stop being so angry. They're angry. And they've got to start being partners to keep this -- really, look, is just an incredible miracle that's going on? We want to keep it going."
00:19:48 - 00:20:10 (22 sec),"Keep it going, and it will keep going. It will keep going. There's so much to celebrate in our country, the economy, the military, so many things we've done scientifically. The world is trying to copy what we've done, they're not going to be able to do it. Not anymore. They were catching up fast, now they're going in the wrong direction."
00:20:10 - 00:22:05 (115 sec),"Wrong direction. Unfortunately, many of the Democrats in Congress responded to my call for bipartisan cooperation by instead choosing really -- hey, look, did you ever see anything -- radical resistance, it's the radical left. But maybe it'll change. [Audience Boos] Maybe it'll change. It all has to do with 2020 and the election."
00:22:05 - 00:22:19 (15 sec),"But I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of ""Let's hop a train to California."" [Audience Boos] Of you're not allowed to own cows anymore. You know, a lot of problems. A lot of problems. But nobody's ever had this. And by the way with us, we handle it. No president should ever have to go through what we've gone through in the first two years."
00:22:19 - 00:22:35 (15 sec),"It's a hoax. It's a disgrace, and it should never be allowed to happen again. A hoax. Just recently, as an example, Senator Richard Burr, from the great State of North Carolina. He's chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and they've been investigating this Russia hoax for two years. [Audience Boos] Think of it. They've interviewed over 200 people."
00:22:35 - 00:22:55 (20 sec),"They've studied hundreds of thousands of documents and pages and Richard just announced that they found no collusion between Donald Trump and Russia collusion. The fact is, that the real collusion was between Hillary and the Democrats and the other side with Russia, that's where the collusion is. That's where the collusion is. [Audience chants Lock her up] That's starting to make a lot more sense."
00:22:55 - 00:24:44 (109 sec),"But that's where the collusion is, with the Democrats, and with Russia, and with others. And by the way, there's also collusion between the Democrats and the fake news right here. [Audience Boos] And they know it better than anybody. Too many Democrats are focused on tearing down their opposition instead of building up our country."
00:24:44 - 00:25:27 (43 sec),"They're trying to impose some of the most extreme measures and policies ever put forward by our Congress. And by the way, I don't think anybody in this room wants to pay 70, 80, 90 and 95 percent tax. Does anybody want to pay a 90 percent tax? [Audience Boos] You know, you look at what we've done with jobs, what we've done with the economy, how low your taxes are, the lowest they've been almost from the beginning, who the hell wants to change what we're doing now?"
00:25:27 - 00:25:52 (25 sec),"We are a hot, hot country. Last week they introduced a massive government takeover that would destroy our incredible economic gains. They introduced the so-called Green New Deal. [Audience Boos] It sounds like a high school term paper that got a low mark. [Audience laughs] It would shut down American energy, which I don't think the people in Texas are going to be happy with that. [Audience Boos]"
00:25:52 - 00:26:14 (22 sec),"It would shut down a little thing called air travel. [Audience Boos] How do you take a train to Europe? [Audience laughs] You know, this -- this crazy senator from Hawaii, they said, ""Do you like it?"" ""Yes, I like it very much."" Oh, really, how are we getting to Hawaii on a train? [Audience laughs] She didn't think about that one but she's thinking about it. She'll figure it out."
00:26:14 - 00:26:42 (27 sec),"They want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home, and put millions of Americans out of work, spend $100 trillion, which by the way, there's no such thing as $100 trillion, you have to spend $100 trillion -- And remember this, no other country except us is going to do it. That's a little problem, too."
00:26:42 - 00:27:17 (35 sec),"While the world's real polluters, like China, would get many of our companies and factories, they'd just move into China, move into other parts of the world. That's the way the system works. It's not going to happen folks. Don't worry, it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. $100 trillion. Let's spend $100 trillion."
00:27:17 - 00:27:46 (29 sec),"Let's rip down every building in New York City and rebuild it environmentally slightly better. To pave the way for socialism, Democrats are calling for massive tax hikes and the complete elimination of private health care. Many of us have private health care. That means you can stand on line for five days as you wait for a doctor that is not nearly as talented as your doctor."
00:27:46 - 00:28:10 (24 sec),"Remember? ""You can keep your doctor."" Remember that? 28 times, ""You can keep it."" That didn't happen. It turned out to be alive. Hey, where are the fact checkers? You know, some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact checkers. 28 times, ""You can keep your doctor."" That didn't turn out to be what he said."
00:28:10 - 00:29:31 (81 sec),"They're coming for your money and they're coming for your freedom and it'll never happen and it won't even come close, folks. Democrats are also pushing extreme late-term abortion. [Audience Boos] Allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. What's that all about?"
00:29:31 - 00:29:48 (18 sec),"So in Virginia, the governor, he's got a little publicity lately. [Audience laughs] I like it. It keeps us out of the papers. I like it. I'd like to find a few more guys like this one. He almost moon walked. His wife stopped him, ""Darling, that would be inappropriate."" I want to see somebody trying to imitate Michael Jackson in the moonwalk."
00:29:48 - 00:30:18 (30 sec),"This would not have been a good scene. His wife saved him, darling, this would be inappropriate."" I think she was right. But the governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable. And then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby."
00:30:18 - 00:30:53 (34 sec),"Execute the baby. [Audience Boos] Incredible. Millions of innocent, beautiful babies are counting on us to protect them and we will. That is why last week I go I called on Congress, with your great congressman over there -- thank you, fellas -- to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion."
00:30:53 - 00:31:13 (20 sec),"And that certainly is extreme. Many people never even heard of it. I mean, have you ever even hear of anything like this? [Audience calls out No] Democrats must also address the double standard on full display in Virginia. By the way, that state's going to go Republican pretty soon, I'm pretty sure -- because the Democrat Party has never been more outside of the mainstream."
00:31:13 - 00:31:36 (23 sec),"They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders, and crime. [Audience Boos] This weekend, some Democrats even proposed a measure that would force the release of thousands of criminal illegal aliens -- [Audience Boos] -- including dangerous felons convicted of rape, sex trafficking, violent assault, and even murder, into our country."
00:31:36 - 00:32:06 (31 sec),"Can you believe this? [Audience Boos] Their proposal would put a hard cap on the number of illegal aliens that are brave ICE officers, we love our ICE officers -- can detain and thus remove, forcing thousands of criminals to be set free into United States communities. I don't think so. Okay. I don't think so. And I want to thank our ICE offices."
00:32:06 - 00:32:51 (45 sec),"What they put up is incredible and that includes Border Patrol and that includes law enforcement. Let's face it. Law enforcement, we love them. They keep us safe. In the last two years alone, ICE officers have made 200, listen to these numbers, 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 40,000, 40,000 larcenies 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 12,000 vehicle thefts, 11,000 robberies, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 murders. [Audience Boos]"
00:32:51 - 00:33:10 (19 sec),"-- murders, murders, killings, murders. [Audience chants Build that wall] We will. We will. If we cut detention space, we are cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country. Slashing ICE tension is the first step of many for the far left, I call them the radical left We will never abolish ICE."
00:33:10 - 00:33:44 (34 sec),"They want to abolish ICE. We're never going to abolish ICE. So let me say very clearly to those pushing this ridiculous and radical agenda, I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country. And I will never abolish or in any way mistreat our great heroes from ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement, never."
00:33:44 - 00:34:12 (28 sec),"We will always stand with those brave men and women. We will always be with them. We're going to take care of them just like they take care of us, remember that. Now, I have to tell you, as I was walking up to the stage they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we're building the Wall anyway."
00:34:12 - 00:35:10 (58 sec),"They say that progress has been made, interesting. Just now. Just now. I said, ""Wait a minute. I got to take care of my people from Texas. I got to go. I don't even want to hear about it."" I don't want to hear it. So I don't know what they mean ""progress is being made significant"". Now, what did happen is the Democrats were being hit really hard on the concept of releasing criminals into our society, that has not been playing well."
00:35:10 - 00:35:35 (25 sec),"So maybe progress is being made, maybe not. But I had a choice, I could have stayed out there and listened or I could have come out to the people of El Paso in Texas. I chose you. I chose you. So -- so we probably have some good news. But who knows? Who knows? We'll -- we're -- we're setting the stage folks."
00:35:35 - 00:36:22 (47 sec),"You know what it's called, right? It's called with setting the stage. We're setting the table. We're doing whatever we have to do the walls being built, it'll continue. It's going at a rapid pace. The Rio Grande, it's happening, go check it out. We proudly welcome those who come lawfully, and support our values in the United States, and that want to strengthen our society and help us with all of the companies moving into the United States, moving back, they left us now they're moving back, many of them, in some cases, maybe all of them, but they all want to come back because the United States is where the action is, very simple. [Audience chants USA]"
00:36:22 - 00:37:00 (38 sec),"It's where the action is. And it is -- we're most proud of the fact, you look at the car companies, they're moving back. They're going into Michigan. They're going into Pennsylvania. They're going back to Ohio. So many companies are coming back. And by the way, that's why I want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit."
00:37:00 - 00:37:29 (29 sec),"Through merit, so they can help us build our country. Make America Great Again, pretty soon we're going to be saying, Keep America Great, Keep America Great. Pretty soon. Pretty soon, congressman, Keep America Great. We'll have to switch over. Tell me, tell me, the campaign's sort of started because you have these people that nobody ever heard of, they're all running for office."
00:37:29 - 00:38:19 (50 sec),"I said, ""Who is that?"" ""Well, that person was a mayor of a city that was defeated."" Well, how about Beto, Beto was defeated to, right? [Audience Boos] But he suffered a great defeat. Watch what the news does tomorrow, though, they won't mention the disparity. They won't mention the disparity tomorrow. They'll say, ""Beto O'Rourke,"" That's his last name, right, O'Rourke?"
00:38:19 - 00:38:58 (38 sec),"Beta O'Rourke had a wonderful rally of about 15 people. [Audience laughs] No, when they get honest, when the media starts becoming honest, and maybe they will, because we've done something that's never been done before, we have suffered a totally dishonest media and we've won and it's driving them crazy."
00:38:58 - 00:39:36 (38 sec),"It's driving them crazy. It's driving them crazy but look at them, they still come. I've never said anything like it. But illegal immigration hurts all Americans, including millions of legal immigrants, by driving down wages, draining public resources, and claiming countless innocent lives. You see what's going on, folks."
00:39:36 - 00:40:37 (61 sec),"You know what's going on. They give you all of these phony stats they say, ""Oh, it's the same. It's the same."" It's not the same. It's a bad situation going on and we've stopped it. We are taking out thousands and thousands of people from MS-13, we're bringing them to hell out of our country, thousands. But if we had proper border security, including a very powerful wall, we wouldn't have to work so hard and it would be a lot safer and a lot better."
00:40:37 - 00:41:13 (36 sec),"My Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration, while modernizing our legal immigration system, which has been in terrible shape for many, many decades to prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves for them actually and contribute to our economy, people that come in on merit, merit, merit -- instead of random lotteries and chain migration."
00:41:13 - 00:41:39 (26 sec),"Chain migration, that's another beauty. [Audience Boos] We want a merit based system for entry, this will improve living conditions for all Americans living here today, both immigrant and U.S. born, everybody's going to be happy. And we need the people to take care of these companies that are moving. Our unemployment rate, real unemployment, 3.6, 3.7 -- and going down, had a little blip because of a thing called the shutdown."
00:41:39 - 00:42:47 (68 sec),"But remember, it went up to 4.0. I said, ""Boy, that's -- "" Do you know how low 4.0 is? Do you know anybody else, any other president that would have said, ""Please give me 4.0, please?"" [Audience laughs] We had a little blip, it went up from 3.7 to 4.0, just quickly. But you know what? If we didn't do that shutdown we would not have been able to show this country these politicians, the world, what the hell is happening with the border."
00:42:47 - 00:43:19 (33 sec),"That was a very important thing we did. And the fact is, illegal immigration is a heartbreaking human tragedy. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the very long and dangerous journey north up to our country. Sex traffickers, these are the worst human beings on Earth, exploit our porous border to sell young girls and women into modern day slavery."
00:43:19 - 00:44:21 (62 sec),"You wouldn't even know that, nobody knows that. And by the way, do you think they come in through the ports of entry? [Audience calls out No] I listen to the Democrats, let me nice, just say the Democrats, I won't be specific, and they say, ""Oh, everything comes through the port."" They don't do that. They drive out where there's no barrier, no wall, they make a left."
00:44:21 - 00:44:56 (34 sec),"Congratulations, you're in the United States. That's all. If you have three women tied up in the backseat of a car, you're not going through, folks, a port of entry where they do look in the backseat, at least, right? Drugs pouring through the border kills tens of thousands of innocent Americans a year, including heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, and so many others."
00:44:56 - 00:45:31 (35 sec),"They come through the Southern border. We have a drug problem over the last 6, 7, 10 years like we have never had before. We can have such a big cut in the numbers, in the percentages, if we get the Wall built -- if we have a strong Wall with other things, but we need the Wall and it has to be built and we want to build it fast."
00:45:31 - 00:46:02 (30 sec),"The number of illegal immigrants crossing our borders is so large that we've know where to hold them. We have to build -- they want buildings, they want jails. They want, these people, how about the word caravan? [Audience Boos] Caravan, I think that was one of mine, but it looked like a caravan. Where you have thousands and thousands of people coming from Guatemala, from Honduras, and El Salvador, and they march up through Mexico."
00:46:02 - 00:46:26 (24 sec),"And by the way, if we didn't have walls in those areas, in some cases that we put up, in many cases where we reinforced, in many cases where our great military helped us with barbed wire -- you would have people pouring in. They don't pour in. The problem is our laws are so bad that there's no way we can quickly remove them."
00:46:26 - 00:46:59 (33 sec),"Other countries say, ""Get out of here."" We have to bring them through a court system. We sign their names, they touch our land, we sign them up, we explained to them, ""Please come back in six years for court,"" and only the dumbest people show back up. Nobody ever shows up. Nobody comes back in, like 2 percent."
00:46:59 - 00:47:33 (34 sec),"They go in to our country. The good news is we have great law enforcement and many of these people, we know where they are, and we're going to get them the hell out. But we have to change our laws. So right now we have a backlog. You won't even believe this. Other countries don't do this. Somebody walks into our country, we bring them to court, we have now a legal -- we need Perry Mason -- [Audience laughs] -- we have a legal case."
00:47:33 - 00:48:07 (34 sec),"Nobody else does that. Other countries say, ""Get out. You can't come in. You're not a citizen of whatever country."" We bring them in. So listen to this, right now we have almost 900,000 cases, 900,000. How many judges are going to take care of -- we're going to have to hire tens of thousands of judges to do that, 900,000 cases."
00:48:07 - 00:48:58 (50 sec),"How stupid is this? This was a system put in place by really dumb people or people that did not have the best interests of our country at heart. And there's no place better to talk about border security, whether they like it or not, because I've been hearing a lot of things,"" Oh, the Wall didn't make that much of a difference."" You know where it made a big difference?"
00:48:58 - 00:49:34 (36 sec),"Right here in El Paso. And I've been watching where they've been trying to say, ""Oh, the Wall didn't make that much -- "" Well you take a look at what they did with their past crimes and how they made them from very serious to a much lesser, you take a look at what the real system is. I spoke to people that have been here a long time they said, ""When that wall went up, it's a whole different ball game."" Is that a correct statement?"
00:49:34 - 00:50:22 (48 sec),"A whole different ball game. I'll give you another example. And I don't care whether a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat, they're full of crap when they say it has it made a big difference. I heard the same thing from the fake news. They said, ""Oh, crime actually stayed the same."" It didn't say the same, it went way down and look at what they did to their past crimes and look at how they recorded those past crimes, it went way, way down."
00:50:22 - 00:50:42 (20 sec),"These people, you know, you'd think did want to get to the bottom of a problem and solve a problem, not try and pull the wool over everybody's eyes. So for those few people that are out there on television saying, ""Oh, it didn't make too much of a difference,"" it made a -- people from El Paso, am I right?"
00:50:42 - 00:51:31 (48 sec),"It's fake news. It's fake. I'm telling you, just fake news. And you know what? You wouldn't even have to know you can say that automatically without even knowing it. It's obvious, it's common sense. Just a few thousand feet, as an example, from where we stand right now on the other side of the border, it's one of the most dangerous cities in the world, Juarez, Mexico."
00:51:31 - 00:52:17 (46 sec),"Well, the people at Juarez agree. Yet, thanks to a powerful border wall and El Paso, Texas it's one of America's safest cities now. Now, listen to the this, so you're talking a few feet away, right, a few feet, got a wall, a few feet away. Last year Juarez had 1,200 murders, El Paso, right next door, a few feet away, had 23 murders."
00:52:17 - 00:52:51 (34 sec),"That's not good either. But 23 compared to 1,200. Walls work, actually there's nothing like them for what we're talking about. We want to stop drugs. We want to stop traffickers. We want to stop criminals from coming in, walls save lives. Walls save tremendous numbers of lives. The biggest proponents of open borders are rich liberals and wealthy donors."
00:52:51 - 00:53:14 (23 sec),"These are hypocrites who oppose security for you while living their entire lives -- I do it too, to be honest with you, I'm guilty. I'm guilty. I also live behind walls, okay. They live behind walls and gates in their guards all over the place. Me too, because I want to be safe and I want to make America safe, if you don't mind. [Audience chants USA]"
00:53:14 - 00:53:43 (29 sec),"So security should not belong only to the rich and to the powerful, safety is the birthright of every American, which is why we must finish the Wall. It's happening. Because walls are not immoral, as it was said, human trafficking is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Drug peddling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes]"
00:53:43 - 00:54:22 (40 sec),"Child smuggling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Sanctuary Cities that get Americans killed, they're immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Open borders are dangerous and immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] My administration has put forward a compromise that really is a compromise, and I hate even compromise on things like this, but it's showing common sense, it's compassionate, and it's going to solve our problem and the cost is a fraction."
00:54:22 - 00:55:27 (64 sec),"When you look at the drugs that are pouring across from Mexico, if it stopped a small percentage, and it won't, it'll stop a large percentage, it would pay for itself in a matter of weeks. That's the kind of numbers you're talking about, a matter of weeks. And by the way, I -- I hate to say this, because we have a very good relationship, but Mexico had the highest number of killings that they've ever had, almost 40,000 people were murdered in Mexico."
00:55:27 - 00:56:13 (46 sec),"Mexico is not too far away, and we need to take care of our people and we're going to do that and it's happening and it's happening a lot faster than anybody thought. And I love that sign. Thank you. What we're proposing includes humanitarian assistance, drug detection at our ports and everywhere else, closing legal loopholes, which is a big problem, and plans for a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier or wall, let's call it a wall, it's better."
00:56:13 - 00:56:52 (40 sec),"This wall will be built in the areas identified by border agents is having the greatest need while safely directing people and commerce to our many lawful ports of entry, which we're beefing up in every way, structurally, with beefing up the ports of entry and mechanically. We have equipment now that can spot drugs."
00:56:52 - 00:57:31 (38 sec),"It's incredible stuff. It's expensive. It's incredible. By the way, there is nothing better than a good old-fashioned German Shepherd. It's hard to believe, right. It's true you know, I -- I was with the people and they're showing me this incredible computerized stuff and where it goes. I said ""Could I -- ""Because Secret Service took me out to the place and they were showing me these German Shepherds, they're unbelievable."
00:57:31 - 00:58:04 (33 sec),"They'll run past all these empty boxes and one of the boxes has drugs in it, deep down in a box and they come to a screeching halt barking at it every time. So I asked the people that sell the machinery, at a lot of money, so I said, ""Let me ask you a question. This stuff is incredible. I'm really impressed."
00:58:04 - 00:58:47 (43 sec),"How does it compare to a German Shepherd?"" The guy looks at and says, ""Sir, honestly, it's not as good."" Can you believe it? A German Shepard. Certain types of dogs, pretty good. You do love your dogs, don't you? I wouldn't mind having one, honestly, but I don't have any time, I don't have -- How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn, would that be -- Right, sort of not for -- I don't know, it doesn't -- I don't feel good."
00:58:47 - 00:59:23 (35 sec),"It feels a little phony-phony to me. A lot of people say, ""Oh, you should get a dog."" ""Why?"" ""It's good politically."" I said, ""Look, that's not the relationship I have with my people. We want -- "" [Audience members yells something about Obama] Yeah, Obama had a dog, you're right. [Laughter] Both parties should come together to finally create a safe and lawful system of immigration."
00:59:23 - 01:00:13 (51 sec),"The American people have waited long enough. We must secure the border, pass Kate's Law -- end Catch and Release, shutdown Sanctuary Cities -- you know, we need Democrat votes to do that -- deport criminal aliens, and keep the coyotes and traffickers and drug dealers the hell out of our country, please. And the Democrats also need to confirm the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are sitting in the Senate waiting for confirmation, people that have given up their lives to work in the Trump administration and the Democrats aren't approving them."
01:00:13 - 01:00:35 (22 sec),"It's a record. [Audience Boos] It's total obstruction. It's a record of the history of our country there has never been -- Some people left the job a year and a half ago, two years ago, to become an ambassador or to work at one of our many great agencies and we can't get Schumer and his friends to approve them."
01:00:35 - 01:01:00 (25 sec),"It's total obstruction. There's never been anything like it. Very, very unfair, very unfair to these people. In many cases, seriously, they've left jobs and they're waiting and waiting and waiting, they're slow walking every single one of them. It's a disgrace. As we fight to protect our borders we must also protect our newfound prosperity."
01:01:00 - 01:01:42 (42 sec),"My administration has taken the toughest ever action to crack down on years of China's abuse and its trade practices have been very unfair. And I have a lot of respect for President Xi, but he's representing China and I'm representing the United States. We're also replacing one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever done, although I happen to think that the WTO is not so good either, we're replacing NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that everybody is loving."
01:01:42 - 01:02:01 (19 sec),"We've got to get Congress to approve it. We've got to get Congress to approve. We'll get it, I think done. I mean, there's such obstruction in Congress, you know, they won't even do things that are good for our country now. They would rather have Trump have a loss than get something that's so good for our country."
01:02:01 - 01:02:20 (19 sec),"Our farmers are happy, everybody's happy. And it's going to be jobs. You know, what it does? It stops companies from moving out. It makes it very hard economically for companies to say, ""Hey, thanks a lot. We're firing everybody, we're moving to Mexico."" Makes it very, very hard. You know, that's been a bone of contention for me for many years."
01:02:20 - 01:02:47 (27 sec),"I've seen 25 percent and more of our automobile business move to Mexico and it's not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. Unless they want to pay nice big fat tariffs to send their cars back into this country We've achieved, and by the way, tariffs had have had an incredible effect. Just ask the folks in China, ""How are we doing with tariffs?"" You ask."
01:02:47 - 01:03:23 (36 sec),"And you ask, ""How are we doing in our negotiations?"" The fact is, and I say it openly, either they treat us fairly or they have to pay for the privilege of coming in and taking our wealth and taking our jobs, it's very simple. It's very, very simple. And if you look back at our country when we were very rich, when we had no debt, when we had no problems economically, you take back -- you take a look, 1888, the Great Tariff Debate, you know the debate was about?"
01:03:23 - 01:03:45 (22 sec),"Our country had so much money they had to debate what the hell to do with all the money because tariffs were bringing in a fortune into the United States. So at a minimum, countries in negotiating with us very seriously because of the fact that they don't want to have to pay to come in and take advantage of our country, that's at a minimum."
01:03:45 - 01:04:23 (38 sec),"Check it out, 188. Have the press check it out. They'll say, ""Donald Trump said 1888."" [Audience Laughs] We've achieved the largest decline in drug prices in 46 years, prescription drugs. And I'm asking Congress to work with me to make prescription drugs affordable for every American family. We just got the largest decrease in drug prices, think of that, and it's not easy, it's not easy."
01:04:23 - 01:04:43 (20 sec),"Because we have middlemen that take care of a lot of people for a lot of years, these middlemen and the drug companies, but even worse, the middleman, and we're cutting the middleman out. they're not going to like be very much. They made a lot of money. But think of that, they're better the first time in 46 years."
01:04:43 - 01:05:15 (32 sec),"And now we're going to phase three, we did one statutorily, we did two statutorily, now we go to phase three, we're getting your drug prices down. We're embarking on bald initiatives to defeat AIDS. Who knew that? We have medicines now that work wonders on AIDS. We're looking to be AIDS-free in not many years as a country and maybe help, also, the world, the world."
01:05:15 - 01:05:48 (33 sec),"So we want to defeat AIDS and we want to feed childhood cancer. We've made tremendous strides. Tremendous strides. In the Middle East, are brave warriors have liberated virtually 100 percent of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Now, you don't hear that from these people. Now, we've taken back -- soon it'll be announced soon, maybe over the next week, maybe less, but it'll be announced very soon -- we'll have 100 percent."
01:05:48 - 01:06:07 (18 sec),"When I took over this country, it was a mess. And if I wouldn't have been elected -- You know, I have so many people, I was just walking up and every time it happens, ""Sir, thank you. Thank you very much."" This guy, he's -- he's like a monster. No, no, it's true. These people. This guy is like a monster."
01:06:07 - 01:06:28 (21 sec),"He's like this monster football -- a big, strong guy. He says to me, he said, ""Thank you very much."" I don't know what they're saying, but that's okay. Now he's this big, strong guy and he's crying. And he said, ""Mr. -- "" I'm walking up and it happens all the time. ""Thank you very much, Mr. President."" I said, ""For what?"" He said, ""You've saved our country."
01:06:28 - 01:06:54 (26 sec),"Our country was going in the wrong direction. You've saved our country. Thank you."" I've had so many people say that. So many people. You know what the truth is though? I didn't save our country, we're now heading in the right direction. It's very tough because we have so many things were fighting, including these people."
01:06:54 - 01:07:17 (23 sec),"But so many people that we're finding, so many people that are either foolish or ill-intentioned. But you know, I didn't save our county, you know saved our country, you saved our country. You saved our country, and God. Because there's never -- nothing like this has ever happened before. And you know what?"
01:07:17 - 01:07:48 (30 sec),"The world is watching and when prime ministers, and when presidents, and kings and queens, they talked to me they say, ""Congratulations on what's happened with your economy, Mr. President, it's incredible."" They're emulating what we're doing. They can't believe it. So we continue to decimate the remnants, because they're always going to be remnants, we can take the area the land, we'll soon have 100 percent, but they're always remnants, they get out, they wrap themselves in bombs."
01:07:48 - 01:08:30 (42 sec),"They're crazy. They're lunatics. But you're always going to have that. But we want to bring, now -- we've got 100 percent. It was so bad when I took over, it was going the opposite direction. Syria, we want to bring our troops back home. It's time. It's time. It's time. And thanks to the extraordinary service of our military in Afghanistan, 19 years we're in Afghanistan, we may now be able to seek a political resolution that, frankly, they've wanted to talk about for a long time."
01:08:30 - 01:08:55 (26 sec),"We've hit them very hard, but it's been 19 years. Think of that, 19 years. We spend more on military in Afghanistan, $50 billion a year, than most countries spend on their entire country, healthcare, education, everything. We spend more than they do. It's time to start thinking smart for our country. What we want to build our country."
01:08:55 - 01:09:33 (38 sec),"We want to spend money in our country. We want to build our roads, and highways, and bridges, and dams. And last month the United States recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and condemned the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. [Audience Boos] Everywhere socialism has been, everywhere it's been implemented, it's produced poverty, misery, repression, and despair."
01:09:33 - 01:10:35 (61 sec),"You take a look no matter where. Yet, there are those trying to implement socialism right here in the United States. So I, again, say to you -- [Audience Boos] -- and I say it for the world to hear, America will never be a Socialist country, never, never. [Audience chants USA] We're born free. We will live free and we will die free."
01:10:35 - 01:11:20 (46 sec),"We will always be free. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and our great rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American way."
01:11:20 - 01:11:41 (21 sec),"We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our incredible history, and always respect our great American flag. We believe that the first duty of government is to be loyal to its citizens."
01:11:41 - 01:12:18 (37 sec),"And we live by the words of our national motto that we are going to keep -- we'll never change this -- In God We Trust. These are the beliefs, traditions, and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as great patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the great State of Texas."
01:12:18 - 01:13:07 (49 sec),"From Houston to Austin, from Dallas to El Paso -- from the Red River to the Rio Grande, the Lone Star State embodies the spirit of independence like maybe no other place anywhere in the world. And you have always embraced the cause of American Freedom like no one else. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo."
01:13:07 - 01:13:46 (38 sec),"This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzalez, armed with a single cannon, stared down a foreign, powerful army and declared, ""Come and take it."" Come on, come on, take it. Texas is the state where generations of farmers, ranchers, oil workers, and pioneers help build up the most extraordinary nation in all of human history."
01:13:46 - 01:14:18 (32 sec),"That's what we are. We were losing track, we didn't lose track getting more, we're just great on that track. Now, just like generations of Texas patriots who came before, you are going to make your stand. That's what we've done, we've made our stand and we've made it together. This is a big group of millions and millions of people that have come together like never before in our history."
01:14:18 - 01:15:31 (73 sec),"This has never happened before. And we've come for safety, for sovereignty, and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America. And together, with the proud and incredible and great people of the State of Texas, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:01:07 (67 sec),"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much, Grand Rapids. It's great to be back. Right here in America's heartland. You know that, right? With the hard-working patriots from the great state of Michigan. By the way we are bringing a lot of those car companies back. Remember I told you they are coming back?"
00:01:07 - 00:01:47 (40 sec),They are pouring back in. They are coming back. They are coming back fast. This has been an incredible couple of weeks for America. The economy is roaring. The ISIS caliphate is defeated 100 percent. And after three years of lies and smears and slander the Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over.
00:01:47 - 00:02:43 (56 sec),"The Special Counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction. I could have told you that two and a half years ago very easily. Total exoneration. Complete vindication. You know, it's interesting Robert Mueller was a God to the Democrats, was a God to them until he said there was no collusion."
00:02:43 - 00:03:52 (69 sec),"They don't like him so much right now. The crazy attempt by the Democrat party and the fake news media right back there -- And the deep state to overturn the results of the 2016 election have failed, the greatest election that we've had in a long time may be right from the beginning. [Audience Chants Trump] This was nothing more than a sinister effort to undermine our historic election victory and to sabotage the will of the American people."
00:03:52 - 00:04:41 (49 sec),"This is the one we want. We want ourselves. We want us and that's what we got. We came from all over to vote. They've never taken it away from us, never. Never. Our movement took on the political establishment, the corrupt media and it's never been more corrupt than it is today. And many special interests, that's why they tried to do everything possible to take us out but we are very tough to take out aren't we? Very, very, very."
00:04:41 - 00:05:43 (61 sec),"The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and eat illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans, many of them. They suffered with an elaborate hoax. They wanted to destroy a movement like our country has never seen before. That's true. Never seen before. And believe me, if these people thought that that wasn't true, they would be writing it. They've never seen anything like it. Nobody has in this country's history and in most countries histories there has never been anything like what we did in 2016 on November 8. We defeated a very corrupt establishment and we kept our promise to the American people and it's driving them crazy."
00:05:43 - 00:06:08 (25 sec),"Today our movement and our country are thriving. Their fraud has been exposed and the credibility of those who pushed this hoax is forever broken and they've now got big problems. And the harm done to our country -- think of what they've done. Think of the time wasted and yet despite this terrible cloud, this phony, corrupt, disgusting cloud we have done more together in the first two years than any administration in the history of our country."
00:06:08 - 00:06:39 (31 sec),"And this group of major losers did not just ruthlessly attack me, my family, and everyone who questioned their lies, they tried to divide our country, to poison the national debate, and to tear up the fabric of our great democracy, the greatest anywhere in the world. They did it all because they refuse to accept the results of one of the greatest Presidential elections, probably number one in our history."
00:06:39 - 00:07:14 (35 sec),"Many, many people were badly hurt by this scam. But more importantly our country was hurt. Our country was hurt and they're on artificial respirators right now. [Laughter] They are getting mouth to mouth resuscitation. Little pencil-neck Adam Schiff. He's got the smallest, thinnest neck I've ever seen. [Laughter] He is not a long ball hitter but I saw him today well, we don't really know."
00:07:14 - 00:07:32 (18 sec),"There could still have been some Russia collusion. Sick. Sick. These are sick people and there has to be accountability because it's all lies and they know it's lies. They know it. They know it. Jerry Nadler, I've been fighting him for many years. He was the Congressman from Manhattan. I built great things in Manhattan."
00:07:32 - 00:08:16 (44 sec),"I had to beat him many, many times. Now I come here, I have to beat him again. Can you believe? I want every record in the history of the Trump organization. Every single sheet of paper. And what do you have to justify? Nothing. It doesn't matter. We will find something somewhere along the line. A mistake must have been made."
00:08:16 - 00:08:56 (40 sec),"These people are sick. Sick. Every single deal. Every single paper. All of the Democrat politicians, the media bosses bad people. The crooked journalist, the totally dishonest TV pundits and by the way they know it's not true. They just got great readings. By the way their ratings dropped through the floor last night."
00:08:56 - 00:09:35 (39 sec),"Did you see that? And our friends Tucker, Sean, Laura through the roof last night. And all of the current and former officials who paid for, promoted, and perpetuated the single greatest hoax in the history of politics in our country they have to be -- I'm sorry. They have to be accountable. Just think of. A fake, dirty dossier millions and millions of dollars paid for it. By who?"
00:09:35 - 00:10:28 (53 sec),"Crooked Hillary Clinton, the DNC and the Democrat party. Think of it. This is what they used. But they failed. They failed in one way. Can you believe it? Maybe I got lucky. Maybe I got lucky because the fake news they wouldn't put it on. Even they didn't be leave it. Think of it, they spent millions of dollars and the deal was they get it published or printed all of these horrible lies, all now totally exposed as fake."
00:10:28 - 00:11:02 (33 sec),They were going to get it printed just before the election and they couldn't get any of the media to print it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. You never know. You never know. You lose a few vote and that could be the difference but they wouldn't print it so I will tell you on that score I give the media a lot of credit.
00:11:02 - 00:11:33 (31 sec),"It came out after the election and everybody had a big, fat yawn. [Laughter] And I heard about Russia. I'd be running, I'd be hearing -- they'd say something about Russia. I'd say Russia, what does that have to do -- ? This went on. Little -- and then all of the sudden I hear were you involved with Russia?"
00:11:33 - 00:12:08 (35 sec),"I say Russia? What the hell does Russia have to do with my campaign? It's true. Russia. Russia. You know I go up to Wisconsin where she didn't go, she was told you know many, many years, decades, since a Republican one although Bill Clinton said he was in Wisconsin and you'd better get up there, there are a lot of signs up saying Trump Pence, a lot of signs."
00:12:08 - 00:12:28 (20 sec),"A lot of those signs. You'd better get up there darling. And they said no, no, no. Don't worry about Wisconsin because you know Wisconsin the pollsters say we're doing great. They don't come to a place called Michigan. Have you ever heard of Michigan? Michigan. And Bill Clinton said you know I was in Michigan, you'd better get to Michigan."
00:12:28 - 00:13:23 (55 sec),"It's not looking good. They have so many of those damn signs. Every place I look they have the sign on somebody's lawn. You'd better get up to -- know, Michigan hasn't been lost in decades by the Dems. By the Dems. Hasn't been lost. And if you remember this was my last stop. This was it. And I'll never forget this was a spur of the moment because I heard crooked Hillary and Bill, Barack Obama and Michelle -- they were all headed here, right, at the last moment."
00:13:23 - 00:14:04 (41 sec),"They had a tiny, little crowd and I had I'd like to say more but I can't have more than this because every seat is gone and outside you have 25,000 people. And I remember leaving and I said so she's got 500 people and I had 32,000 people including the people outside. I will tell you we have more tonight because outside we have even more than we did then."
00:14:04 - 00:14:32 (28 sec),"And I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning so it's now election day. In fact I actually said am I allowed to do this? It's 1 o'clock in the morning. I had made six speeches and when I heard she was coming I said you know what, what the hell. [Laughter] So it was spur of the moment, last second. We called and we had 32,000 people including all of the people outside."
00:14:32 - 00:15:07 (35 sec),"She had [Inaudible]. I said so let me explain. Let me ask. So she's here at prime time 730, I'm here at one in the morning. She has 500 or 600 people, I have 32,000. Can you explain why am I going to lose Michigan? Why? Why am I going to lose Michigan? Why am I going to lose the great state? I was asking my people."
00:15:07 - 00:15:45 (38 sec),"I get home at 4 o'clock in the morning and I told our great First Lady, soon to be first lady -- and she's doing a great job. They love her. I said you know I have this incredible crowd and I didn't start speaking until 1 o'clock in the morning. I said how the hell could I lose Michigan and guess what we didn't lose Michigan."
00:15:45 - 00:16:32 (47 sec),"And you know what, we didn't lose Wisconsin either. And the fact is we won a lot of places that night. We won Pennsylvania. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won Florida. We ran the East Coast. We won Iowa, you'd better believe Iowa. We love Iowa. We won. We won a lot. We won a lot. Well, we 306 to 223. Would you say that's good?"
00:16:32 - 00:17:11 (39 sec),"I say that's good. Because of here. Remember they said there is no way -- . The day of the election I'm saying you know this is pretty lousy. It's all fake news. You know they are trying to put it in your head. They go there is no way to 270. In other words I needed 270 to win. There is no way for Donald Trump, I wasn't President."
00:17:11 - 00:17:53 (42 sec),"Then, I was a little short of President There is no way on CNN for Donald Trump, remember the red board? It was so red; the red was killing -- they were dying. There is no way for 270 for Donald Trump. It will be a very short evening for Donald Trump there just is no way and they were right. We didn't get 270. We got 306. But in this country -- [Audience chants Four more years] But in this country, we cannot criminalize political differences, political differences."
00:17:53 - 00:18:20 (27 sec),We do not abuse the law enforcement and intelligence power to target our political opponents when they spy on me. Whoever heard of this? They spied on me. They spied on our campaign. Who would think that's possible? The single greatest political hoax in the history of our country and guess what? We won. It's a beautiful thing.
00:18:20 - 00:18:45 (25 sec),"It's a beautiful thing. We love to win. They tried to take something great away from people that came from all over. I always say, they came from the valleys, they came from the mountains, they came out of the damn rivers. I don't know what you were doing in the river but they came from the cities. They came and they came and they didn't even know these people existed."
00:18:45 - 00:19:08 (23 sec),"They are hard-working. They are successful, they are the smartest people, they are the toughest people, they are the most loyal people. They are. They are the smartest. Remember this about yourself. You know I always hear the easily, the release. Well, I always said they said it. I said it here my last night."
00:19:08 - 00:19:42 (34 sec),"I always say they say the easily. They are the elite, I am not. Well, I have a better education than them, I'm smarter than them. I went to the best schools, they didn't. Much more beautiful house, much more beautiful apartment, much more beautiful everything. And I'm President and they are not, right? And then they say the elite, the elite."
00:19:42 - 00:20:07 (25 sec),"They are not elite, you are the elite. We are the elite. I get a kick. I hear so and so the elite. Then you see this guy, like this little schlepper, this is elite? I'm not elite. This is elite. We are the elite. You are smarter. You are sharper. You are more loyal. You are a hell of a lot tougher. A hell of a lot tougher."
00:20:07 - 00:20:29 (22 sec),"So we can't have two different standards of justice in our country. One where the left wing radical establishment can get away with anything they want. But you know, I have to tell you. I said it last night, we have some great, great friends in the media too. You look at Rush and Sean -- And Laura and Steve and Ainsley and Tucker and Jeanine."
00:20:29 - 00:21:19 (50 sec),"Jeanine is back, going to be back on Saturday night. Jeanine, right? And even Greg likes me now. Greg. He started a little slow but he likes Trump. But we have a lot of great support. We really do. We have a lot of great support. Far more than you think but where we really have the support are the voters that pull that handle or whatever the hell they are pulling they are pulling it for us. So the Russia hoax proves more than ever that we need to finish exactly what we came here to do. Drain the swamp."
00:21:19 - 00:21:47 (28 sec),"The Democrats have to now decide whether they will continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bullshit -- Partisan investigations or whether they will apologize to the American people and join us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, bring down the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs which we are doing incredibly, help us fix our broken trade deals which are coming along really well."
00:21:47 - 00:22:14 (27 sec),"We have our team right now in China. They just arrived. China. China. We've gone up, they've gone down but we want them to be healthy. We want them to be happy and healthy. China. And by the way we are building the wall as us -- , we are building that wall. Building -- We are building that wall. [Audience chants build that wall] We had to go down a little bit of a different path but that's okay."
00:22:14 - 00:22:46 (33 sec),"National emergency it is. And if you look at the border and you look at the hundreds of thousands of people that are invading or at least trying to invade our country you would know that we needed and we are building it. And we are building it a lot faster than anybody would -- and better, and better. It's better."
00:22:46 - 00:23:34 (47 sec),"It's faster and it's less expensive. And it's also much more beautiful. And we are building it very rapidly. It's moving along and we renovated vast amounts of wall. A lot of it was in bad shape, we renovated it for 25 cents on the dollar. That's okay, too, right? That's good too. The fake news doesn't want to give us any credit for renovation."
00:23:34 - 00:24:09 (35 sec),"They say even if you rip it down and build a brand-new wall where the wall was, they call that a renovation. That's not a renovation for me. That's not. They do anything they can to -- you're right. Shifty Schiff. They do whatever they can do sort of make it look not so good. We are really doing well but we have a problem."
00:24:09 - 00:25:09 (60 sec),"Our country has never been better economically and people are trying to get in and they have to come in legally and they have to come in based on merit. Based on merit. Despite all that we have been forced to endure every day we are working and fighting and winning. Remember that because we are making America great again and we are making a great for all Americans, all Americans."
00:25:09 - 00:25:35 (26 sec),"And it's getting to be that time, very important. MAGA country. You heard the other day. How about in Chicago? He said -- He said he was attacked by MAGA country. Did you ever hear that one? I don't know -- . May be the only time I've ever agreed with the Mayor of Chicago. That's a terrible situation. That's an embarrassment not only to Chicago."
00:25:35 - 00:26:03 (28 sec),That is an embarrassment to our country what took place there. Remember that. But they are looking at it. So we are delighted to be joined this evening by some really incredible people. People that love you. Members of Congress. Bill Huizenga. Where is Bill? Bill Huizenga. Where is he? Where the hell is he? You didn't get a very good location.
00:26:03 - 00:26:35 (32 sec),"[Laughter] You didn't get a good bill. You did not get a great location but we have some news. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. And Jack Bergman. Thank you, Jack. So here's something good. You ready? In honor of those guys and some of your other representatives and all that we think are fantastic we have some breaking news."
00:26:35 - 00:27:18 (43 sec),"You ready? I don't know. Can you handle it? I don't think you can handle it. I support the Great Lakes. Always have. They are beautiful. They are big, very deep, record deepness, right? And I'm going to get in honor of my friends full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative -- Which you have been trying to get for over 30 years."
00:27:18 - 00:28:02 (44 sec),"So we will get it done. It's time. It's time. It's time. You been trying to get it over 30 years. I would say it's time. Right? Also and as you know this one, we have already pretty much locked up, I'll say locked up. You all understand that because we are very close to getting started on the beautiful new Soo Locks that people have wanted to build for a very, very long time."
00:28:02 - 00:28:39 (37 sec),So we are very close to finishing that one off. And by the way don't let your new Democrat Governor -- or don't let -- Don't let any of our people that find us all of the way now that we have it take credit for it. Okay? Don't let it. Don't let it. You are too smart for that. We are also joined this evening by the Speaker of the Michigan House Lee Chatfield.
00:28:39 - 00:29:22 (43 sec),"Thank you, leave. Thanks, Lee. A person who is doing a fantastic job GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox. And a woman you know very well, she headed up Michigan. They said she was wasting her time, Trump is never going to win Michigan. I said but I'm going to bring back your auto business. Remember? And I did, and I did."
00:29:22 - 00:30:20 (58 sec),"And when we won, I said who is that woman? I want to see her and we put her in charge of the RNC, Republican National Committee. Ronna McDaniel. Ronna. And a friend of mine, he used show but he's very rich he shouldn't be shy. He's one of the biggest builders and real estate people in the world, one of the biggest owners of property."
00:30:20 - 00:30:47 (27 sec),"I shouldn't introduce them because you guys will like him because he's a big owner of property but you own -- you own property, he just owns more of it than you do. [Laughter] And he's a great guy and he's been with me from the beginning, Stanley Chera. Stanley. Those big beautiful buildings in Manhattan."
00:30:47 - 00:31:11 (25 sec),"You know those big beautiful buildings? He owns it. Stanley, how much did you make this month? [Laughter] Stanley is a great guy. Been with us all. He loves you and he's been with us from the beginning and we've had a lot of people with us. We've had people you wouldn't believe we've had a lot of support."
00:31:11 - 00:31:36 (24 sec),"In the last two years we've embarked on an unprecedented economic revival. Unprecedented. America is now the hottest economy anywhere on the planet Earth. There's nobody close. Since our election when the stock market is up almost 50 percent. You are looking like geniuses with your 401(k)s, right? Your wife or your husband is saying darling, you're such a great investor."
00:31:36 - 00:32:15 (39 sec),"How are we doing? We are up 67 percent. Oh, darling, you're so brilliant. [Laughter] In your whole life you've been criticized by her or him but all of the sudden they think you are the single greatest investor. Thank you, Donald. [Laughter] By the way if you want to see those 401(k)s and all of your stocks and all of the things that you own, you want to see them deflate put a good socialist in this position."
00:32:15 - 00:32:55 (39 sec),"Go get yourself a good socialist. You'll see some deflation. You'll see a nice deflate of your stocks and your bonds and your 401(k). We have created since my election 5.5 million new jobs. Nobody would have believed that was possible. Including 600,000 brand-new -- remember, this couldn't happen. You need a magic wand."
00:32:55 - 00:33:22 (28 sec),"Brand-new manufacturing jobs. Well, how did that happen? We were going to have any new man -- it was going down 600,000 and it's going to be increasing by a lot because you have a lot of companies pouring into Michigan and your other great states. A lot. More manufacturing jobs in fact were created in 2018 than in the year in more than 21 years."
00:33:22 - 00:33:58 (35 sec),"That's not bad. That's not bad. And that's not even one of our better statistics. That's actually like at the bottom of the pack. Do you believe me? After years of stagnation wages are rising fast. Do you remember I use to say that people made more money 21 years ago? All of the time and they had one job then they did -- this is two, three years ago, right, than they did working two and three jobs now."
00:33:58 - 00:34:32 (34 sec),"True. But now wages are rising. You have your choice of jobs like I got choice for the veterans, we also got choice for people wanting jobs. So wages are rising substantially for those people. You are doing great but they are also rising most quickly for the lowest income Americans. First time in decades."
00:34:32 - 00:35:07 (35 sec),"And here's a statistic that I love because blue-collar jobs recently grew at the fastest pace in more than 30 years. Whoever thought, right? 30 years. And unemployment has reached the lowest rate in 51 years and soon it will be in the history of our country. 51 years. And to me very important, you remember I use to say what do you have to lose?"
00:35:07 - 00:35:47 (40 sec),"What do you have to lose, right? And I got criticized. You shouldn't say that. I said well, it's true. It's unfair. So importantly to me African-American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment and unemployment among disabled Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:35:47 - 00:36:29 (42 sec),And you remember in the last election they said Donald Trump will not do well with women. I said really? I said really? No. All of the fake news they said you will not do well with women and maybe they didn't want to say they like me to be honest. That I can understand. And then the election came and they said whatever happened to the fact that he wasn't going to do well with women because we did really well with women.
00:36:29 - 00:36:59 (30 sec),"Right? Right? Remember when I was sitting back a couple of them were trying, remember one of the true killers she was crying not from happiness. But we did great with women. We did great with women and I think we are going to do better with women now because you know what? I produced. Because women filled more than 60 percent of all new jobs created last year."
00:36:59 - 00:37:44 (45 sec),"60 percent. Think about. 60 percent. So that means the men better get moving, folks. You are falling behind. The women are -- they are beating you pretty good men. Get going. The women got 60 percent of all of the new jobs. I mean that's an incredible number. We've cut the greatest number of regulations in two years in the history of our country."
00:37:44 - 00:38:20 (37 sec),"Not for two years, in the history of our country. That's one of the things helping us with the jobs. And the United States people don't even believe this, it all happened very recently is now the number one oil and gas producer in the world. Number one. Number one. And by the way Russia is not happy about that but they are fine."
00:38:20 - 00:38:50 (30 sec),"They are doing just fine but they are not happy about that. If Hillary got in you wouldn't have that stat, I can tell you right now. You would be doing wind, windmills and if it doesn't -- if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night. [Laughter] Darling, I want to watch television. I'm sorry, the wind isn't blowing."
00:38:50 - 00:39:39 (49 sec),"I know a lot about wind. I know a lot about wind. We passed massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country. And very importantly for those people with small farms and businesses we got rid of the death tax or the estate tax. So now when you leave your farm or small business to your children under the assumption that you like your children, some people don't. Some people say I wouldn't leave it to them under any circumstances."
00:39:39 - 00:40:15 (36 sec),"I can't stand my kids but for those of you that do which I assume is hopefully a vast majority you don't have an estate tax to pay, they don't. So they can take over your farm, they can take over your business, they don't have to mortgage it to the hilt and then the bank comes in five years later takes it away from your kids."
00:40:15 - 00:40:59 (44 sec),"No tax. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate penalty. The most unpopular part and we are going to hopefully in the court -- in Texas you heard we won the case, now it has to be appealed and then we will go to the United States Supreme Court. We have a chance of killing Obamacare. We almost did it but somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down but we will do it a different way."
00:40:59 - 00:41:32 (33 sec),"You know what, we will do it a different way but we got rid of the individual mandate where you were forced to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to buy bad healthcare. Okay? Not too good. So we are going to get rid of Obamacare. And I said it the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great healthcare."
00:41:32 - 00:41:58 (26 sec),It's good. It's important. And we have created new options to help Americans purchase affordable health plans all across state lines. You now have options you would have never had. The Democrats are pushing socialist government-run healthcare that bans private healthcare for 180 million Americans. Now think of it. A lot of you have private plans and they are great.
00:41:58 - 00:42:28 (31 sec),"They are great and you want that. They want to take them away. That's not going to work. I don't think that's going to work too well. Republicans want you to have an affordable plan that's just right for you and by the way you can use your doctor, remember that? That was a lie. 28 times, 28 times he said that was a lie."
00:42:28 - 00:43:04 (36 sec),"You get cheaper premiums in much lower deductibles. The deductibles and Obamacare are so high on average $7000. You don't get to use it unless a really great tragedy hits and then you don't really want it because you don't give a damn about your deductible, right? You will be in a position where you say who cares about the deductible."
00:43:04 - 00:43:32 (28 sec),"Let's see if I can live. We believe that no one in America should be bankrupted by health care cost and that's what's happening with Obamacare. And remember this because it's very important and I'm speaking now for the Republican party, we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always."
00:43:32 - 00:44:05 (33 sec),Always. My administration has also begun the bold initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and in 2018 drug prices saw their first decline in 46 years. First time. First time. And they will be coming down a lot but this is the first time in 46 years that prescription drugs came down. Even Stanley likes that because he needs plenty of them.
00:44:05 - 00:44:39 (34 sec),"And then we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our amazing veterans. Our amazing veterans. They have been trying to get VA Choice for over 40 years. They couldn't do it. I got it. We signed it six months ago. Now instead of waiting online for one day, one week, two months people that were okay but not feeling well, wait so long that they become terminally ill."
00:44:39 - 00:45:16 (37 sec),"There was no reason for it. Now they go outside, they see a private doctor, we pay the bill, they get better quickly. And for 46 years VA Accountability you couldn't fire anybody in the VA. We had sadists. They took advantage in so many ways of our great veterans. They were rough, they wouldn't have hit them in prime time by the way, not in prime time."
00:45:16 - 00:46:03 (47 sec),"In prime time they would say okay, I don't want to touch you. I'm not going to play. They took advantage of people that are our great heroes that protected us and you couldn't fire them. They stole, they robbed. You couldn't fire them. It didn't matter what you did you couldn't fire them. Called accountability."
00:46:03 - 00:46:40 (37 sec),"We passed seven months ago today we passed VA Accountability. You heard our vets, you stole from us. Guess what, Bill? You're fired. You're fired. Get out. You're fired. And to give former prisoners a second chance I proudly signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. They have been trying to do that for so many years."
00:46:40 - 00:47:12 (33 sec),"So many years. Very unfair. And by the way some of the people that most supported it are the most conservative people you've ever seen. Both, both sides. Very bipartisan believe it or not for a change. But while we are pushing and pursuing all of these commonsense policies to advance the common good for our citizens Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism, resistance."
00:47:12 - 00:47:47 (34 sec),"Resist. Resist and revenge. Revenge. What do you think of their signs resist? What the hell? Let's get something done, right? Resist. Resist. Resist. Isn't that weird? You know you are looking to have a parade that's called resist. You say what the hell does that mean? No, no. We want to do legislation. There are so many things we can be doing together."
00:47:47 - 00:48:20 (33 sec),The Democrats are now advancing an extreme $100 trillion government takeover called the Green New Deal. But I'd rather not talk about it tonight because I don't want to talk them out of it too soon. [Laughter] Because I love campaigning against the Green New Deal. I want them to make they do a big part of their platform.
00:48:20 - 00:48:53 (33 sec),"No more airplanes, no more cows. One car per family. One car. You're going to love that in Michigan. Hey, how do you like the idea of one car per family? You know, I don't think one car per family in Michigan plays too well. Do you agree? Right? Not too well. And it's got to be of course an electric car even if it only goes what, 160 miles?"
00:48:53 - 00:49:27 (34 sec),"What do you do, it's 160 miles? Darling, where do I get a charge? Where do I get a charge, darling? No. We want to have a lot of cars per family. We want people to lead a great life and we want people to make those cars and we want all of these companies to keep coming to Michigan and all of the other great states and building those [Inaudible]. And we had a problem because when they didn't want the airplanes they were saying well, how do you get to Europe?"
00:49:27 - 00:49:57 (29 sec),"Nobody knew. How do you get to Australia? Nobody knew but they are working on it and then they were interviewing this woman from Hawaii, the Senator. The one that was so vicious about Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. Remember? By the way, do we love Justice Gorsuch and do we love Justice Kavanaugh?"
00:49:57 - 00:50:25 (29 sec),"She was so vicious to both and these are great people. She was vicious and they hit her. She didn't know about the Green New Deal and they hit her and she's from Hawaii. What do you think of the Green New Deal? It was just put up by the Democrats. Well, I like it very much but she never saw it. Then they said but you can't fly anymore and she's in Hawaii."
00:50:25 - 00:50:51 (25 sec),"She said but how would I get to my island? They said we are working on some kind of a train system. [Laughter] So she said okay, well then, I am for it 100 percent. It is the craziest thing I have ever seen. They want to rip down all of the buildings in Manhattan and rebuild them. Let's do that. Hey, Stanley, how do you like that idea?"
00:50:51 - 00:51:16 (25 sec),"I don't think so. I don't think Stanley likes that idea too much. It's the craziest thing but you know what, let's let them -- . It's like I attack so violently Pocahontas and -- And I knocked her out of the race I guess and I said what did I do that for? It's too early. I've got to start in about nine months from now."
00:51:16 - 00:51:42 (27 sec),"We've got plenty more to knock out, you're right. They just keep coming, don't they? They just keep coming. Before I took the oath of office the United States automobile industry was decimated and it was going down and you people knew it better than anybody else. We lost one in four auto manufacturing jobs over the last few decades."
00:51:42 - 00:52:21 (39 sec),"Think of it, one in four and I think the numbers were worse than that and so do you. But from the moment I entered the White House my first meeting was a meeting with car executives. I said what do I have to do to get your business going? We talked about CAFE standards where they were choking the engines, just choking them and costing a lot more for the cars and we had a great meeting and we worked on it and worked on it. We took historic and dramatic action to save the American auto industry and to defend American auto workers right here in Michigan."
00:52:21 - 00:52:55 (34 sec),"Right. And just in the last very short period of time we have added another 6000 vehicle manufacturing and auto parts jobs in Michigan alone and prevented thousands more from being shipped overseas and from going to Mexico. They can't do that anymore. Can't do that. Can't do that anymore. Sorry, Mexico."
00:52:55 - 00:53:22 (26 sec),"We want them to give us a little more help on the border by the way. You know Mexico has the toughest immigration laws in the world. We have the worst because the Democrats put in things that are so bad, so bad. Catch and release. You catch them and then you got to release them. Think of it. Visa lottery."
00:53:22 - 00:54:08 (46 sec),"You are in a lottery system from these countries. You pick up a name. Isn't that nice? Guess what? Do you think they are giving us their best people? No, they are not. They are giving us their worst people and so would you and so would I. Visa lottery. That's another beauty. We have nothing but bad coming out of those laws but you know the good thing about what's happening, the rush to the border, another two caravans now are pouring up. Mexico could stop them so easy and you know what?"
00:54:08 - 00:54:49 (41 sec),If they don't it's going to cost them a hell of a lot of money honestly because they could do it so easy. So easy. And if they don't and I'm telling you right now we will close the damn border. [Audience chants USA] And I don't know if you know it or not Michigan but Mexico took about 30 percent of your car business.
00:54:49 - 00:55:09 (20 sec),Not when I was here. When I'm here they are not. It's going the other way. 30 percent and if we close the border that means we are not taking those cars into our country and what does that mean? That means you are going to make more cars right here in the good old USA. That's what it means. Right? Very simple.
00:55:09 - 00:55:37 (28 sec),"It's all very simple. People try and make it too complicated. It's all very simple. One of the gravest threats to the survival of the U.S. auto industry was the job-killing, sovereignty-wrecking Trans-Pacific Partnership. It was going to decimate your industry. That's why one of my very first acts in office was to withdraw our country from that horrible potentially disastrous trade deal."
00:55:37 - 00:56:06 (28 sec),"And stop the offshoring of Michigan jobs. Saved a lot of jobs. That was a disaster. That would have been almost as bad as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world. NAFTA. That was a beauty. Your empty factories are still all over the place. They still haven't recovered from NAFTA. Well, NAFTA is going to be a thing of the past."
00:56:06 - 00:56:35 (29 sec),"Soon. Or we will just go to pre-NAFTA, that was okay, too. We had a huge surplus with Mexico, then we did NAFTA. We lost over the last six, seven years with Mexico $100 billion. Before NAFTA, we made $40-$50 billion. Doesn't sound like too good a deal, right? So we have now the USMCA and it's very good."
00:56:35 - 00:56:57 (22 sec),"If the Democrats want to raise their hand -- it's a hard thing for them to give us a victory but let's see if they raise their hands otherwise, we go to pre-NAFTA. We don't go to NAFTA, we go to pre-NAFTA. That was just okay with me. That was okay with me. A short time later I traveled to Detroit to cancel burdensome regulations that unfairly harm the motor city."
00:56:57 - 00:57:22 (26 sec),It was getting decimated. We renegotiated the U.S. Korea trade agreement to double the American auto exports to Korea. We doubled them. They were not happy about it. And to stop the cheap foreign pickup trucks from flooding our market. That's your best market. Do you know why? Because we have a chicken tax.
00:57:22 - 00:57:52 (30 sec),"We have a tariff, 25 percent and that's why it's your best market because they can't come in here and take away your business and take away your jobs. They weren't thrilled but that's okay. Under my administration we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American. And we are already seeing good results."
00:57:52 - 00:58:31 (39 sec),"Since the election we have created more than 55,000 brand-new motor vehicle and auto parts jobs in our country. 55,000. Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion investment in Michigan including the first new auto plant in Detroit in over a generation. And they are going to be investing in our country $13.5 billion over a very short period of time."
00:58:31 - 00:59:09 (38 sec),"And Ford has just announced a $1 billion investment just outside of Chicago as well as additional $900 million going right here in Michigan. And I've been a little bit disappointed with them because everyone else is coming in but General Motors did just announce a $300 million investment at its Orion assembly plant here in Michigan, right now."
00:59:09 - 00:59:47 (38 sec),"But I'm also fighting with General Motors and the UAW to take swift action on the GM plants at Hamtramck and Warren, Michigan and Lordstown, Ohio. Get the damn plants open. Everyone else is coming in. Get them open now. Right? So with companies like Chrysler and Ford and Toyota and Volkswagen all investing heavily in America and heavily in the state of Michigan we think General Motors will soon be doing the same."
00:59:47 - 01:00:19 (32 sec),"I really do believe it. You know they went before my time they went to China, they spent a lot of money building stuff. They went to Mexico. They spent a lot of money building stuff. That's not helping us much. So we think they are going to come around. As we protect our jobs, we are also protecting America's borders and we are taking on the extremist and they are really radical, radical extremist Democrats who want open borders in crime because that's what happens."
01:00:19 - 01:00:43 (24 sec),"Open borders and crime. Last month alone more than 76,000 illegal immigrants arrived at our borders to be apprehended. We have to apprehend them. Do you know what a great job -- I mean seriously think of that, 76,000 people many of which are rough people. Okay, I'm being nice because they will criticize me if I'm not."
01:00:43 - 01:01:14 (31 sec),"They will say how dare he say that. But we have people that have criminal records. We have a lot of people. We have a lot of problems. We apprehend them. We capture them. Do you know how tough that job is, border patrol? You know how tough? I don't think any of you guys here -- yeah, you would. That guy would like it. There are some people would like it. They love it. The great American patriots and ICE, these are great American patriots."
01:01:14 - 01:01:33 (20 sec),"And we are on track for 1 million illegal aliens trying to rush our borders. It is an invasion, you know that. I say invasion. They say isn't that terrible? I don't know what these people are thinking. You know, it's your country two. What are you thinking? 300 Americans a week die from Mexican-trafficked heroin."
01:01:33 - 01:02:08 (35 sec),"300. Think of it, 300 a week. Tens of thousands of Americans are killed every year by heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, vast quantities of which are smuggled across our southern border. You know that. 78,000 people died and that's a number that's much, much smaller than the real number. To confront the border crisis last month I declared a national emergency on our southern border."
01:02:08 - 01:03:01 (53 sec),The radical Democrats retaliated by passing a reckless resolution to terminate vital border security operations. Can you believe this? In two weeks ago I proudly issued my first veto. And two days ago our great Republicans in the House of Representatives -- I won't get fancy with you I will just say they essentially gave us the right to build the wall and lots of money is pouring in. So we are building the wall.
01:03:01 - 01:03:34 (33 sec),We will be finishing the wall. It's moving along rapidly. We are giving out many additional contracts. We are going to be building it in many different locations simultaneously with different contractors. And sometime over the next two weeks I will be going to a certain place which I won't tell you now because they will be waiting for me. I will be going to a certain place and we are going to be showing you mast sections of brand-new beautiful walls.
01:03:34 - 01:04:02 (28 sec),"Because we are going to put the job to safety and to security of American citizens first. And you know when I campaigned it's going to be so much easier the second time. Remember this, I never did this before and I am one and one, right? We are 1 for 1. 1 for 1. [Inaudible] and it was tough. It was tough."
01:04:02 - 01:04:22 (20 sec),You know why? Because I get up on a stage and I've never debated before but I never left center stage. Right? Never left center stage meaning we were winning the whole time and I debated and I said where are these people coming from but I never did it and I never said to anybody I'm going to produce jobs.
01:04:22 - 01:04:48 (26 sec),I'm going to bring back your auto business. I'm going to do great for the vets. I'm going to do great for tax cuts. I'm going to cut regulations more than anybody in the history of our country in two years. I never said -- I couldn't say that. But I did say that I was going to do it but who the hell's going to believe me? Now I've done more than I ever promised I was going to do so the debate should be very easy.
01:04:48 - 01:05:32 (44 sec),"Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis. [Audience chants four more years] Thank you. Well, I'll give you a question, okay. So I told you before the lowest unemployment rates in the history of our country for African-American great citizens. Now I say that and it's like I say that and I just say your turn, what the hell are they going to do to beat that?"
01:05:32 - 01:06:05 (33 sec),"And we have many other things for every single citizen, everybody is benefiting. Everybody. Everybody is benefiting. So before -- so before first election, my first election. What the hell? I never did it before. I did a good job though do you think? So did you. So did you. You know the fact is we did it together and I've always said it. I didn't do it. We did it together."
01:06:05 - 01:06:48 (43 sec),"But -- but think about it now instead of saying I'm going to do this I'm going to produce 5.5 million new jobs, I'm going to bring back manufacturing 600,000 new jobs in a short period of time. Now I've done it. I mean it should be easy don't you agree? It should be easy. Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis for one simple reason because they have cause the border crisis and you know why else?"
01:06:48 - 01:07:21 (33 sec),"Honestly because they want boats and because they don't want to give us a win. They don't want to give us a win. They put that ahead of what's good for our country. The mass illegal immigration across our border is a direct consequence of Democrats supported loopholes, Democrat promises of amnesty, amnesty."
01:07:21 - 01:08:02 (41 sec),"You have people coming up here you know they are all met by the lawyers, the lawyers and they come out, they are all met by the loiterers and they say the following phrase I am very afraid for my life. I am afraid for my life. Okay. And then I look at the guy, he looks like he just got out of the ring, he's a heavyweight champion of the world, he's [Inaudible]. It's a big fat con job, folks."
01:08:02 - 01:08:41 (39 sec),"It's a big fat con job. And Democrat sanctuary cities and their refusal to protect American borders it's not the money. When I fought for them recently, they gave me so much money for everything else but nothing for the wall. Now think of it. Walls work, folks. We need the wall. They said would you call it slats?"
01:08:41 - 01:09:14 (33 sec),I said I'll call it slats. Would you call it steel barriers? I said I'll -- I said I'll call it whatever the hell you want just give me the money to build it and then they sort of got a little cold feet and now I call it the wall and I got the money anyway. So that's over. But there open border policies are truly a betrayal to the American people.
01:09:14 - 01:10:04 (49 sec),"This is dangerous what's coming into our country is dangerous. To defend the United States of America I deployed the United States military. I got thousands of troops. Right now we have about 4000 troops on our southern border and they are fantastic. And think of it, or years we defended the borders of foreign countries but we don't want to defend our own borders."
01:10:04 - 01:10:41 (38 sec),"Think of how crazy this is. We are defending borders of countries that are 6000 miles away that many of you have never even heard the name of these countries but our southern border, our border along Mexico where we have a lot of problems in drugs and human traffickers and child traffickers and all of this coming in, we don't want to defend our border."
01:10:41 - 01:11:12 (31 sec),"Think of that, how crazy that is. So now we are defending our borders for our country and the people of our country. In the last two years alone ICE officers -- we love ICE, have made listen to this though, 266,000 our risk of criminal aliens. Who the hell wants to do that? You don't want to do it, right?"
01:11:12 - 01:11:48 (35 sec),"You like what you are doing making cars, right? I like making cars I think better, too. But they like it. That's what they do. They are great at it including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,006 crimes, 4000 kidnappings and 4000 murders. Okay. We got them. They got them. How about if you don't get them?"
01:11:48 - 01:12:09 (21 sec),"How about if you leave all of those people? You know what that means for us don't you? The Democrats want to abolish ICE. They want to get rid of these very great patriots, these very tough people that love our country as much as anybody I've ever seen. They want to set violent offenders free and directly they will be coming in to your communities."
01:12:09 - 01:13:04 (55 sec),"We are not going to have it. We are not having it. We want our country to be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not for criminal aliens. Right? The Republican Party will always stand with the heroes of ICE and the heroes of Border Patrol. These are great people. Every day of my Presidency ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens and we are either throwing them behind bars or throwing them the hell out of our country."
01:13:04 - 01:13:35 (31 sec),"And we are throwing out gangs like MS 13. These are some of the sickest, most demented, most vicious people in the world. We are throwing them out of our country by the thousands. In recent months the Democrat party has also been aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion of allowing children -- to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth."
01:13:35 - 01:14:08 (33 sec),"And now we go a step further in Virginia. The Governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby, wrap the baby up, make the baby comfortable, to be executed after birth. That is why in my State of the Union address I called on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting the extreme late-term abortion of babies."
01:14:08 - 01:14:43 (35 sec),"The Democrat Party has never been further outside of the mainstream. They are being brought so far left you wouldn't like it folks. You wouldn't like it. You won't be happy. Radical Democrats are the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, hoaxes and delusions. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans."
01:14:43 - 01:15:12 (29 sec),"It's what we want to be. It's the way we want to live. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream. And every day we make good on the motto promises made, promises kept. Last week I signed in order to defend free speech on college campuses. And to keep America safe we are rebuilding America's military might making it more powerful than ever before by far."
01:15:12 - 01:15:37 (25 sec),I withdrew the United States from the horrible costly one-sided Iran nuclear deal and look what happened. Iran is a different country today than it was two and a half years ago. I recognized Israel's capital and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And just days ago I announced that the United States will recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
01:15:37 - 01:16:05 (28 sec),Very important. Very important. We also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and we strongly condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. We stand with the people of Venezuela and Cuba and Nicaragua and their righteous struggled to finally be free. We stand with them. Doing a lot of work.
01:16:05 - 01:16:46 (41 sec),"Socialism is not a good thing, you are right. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and the American rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way."
01:16:46 - 01:17:36 (49 sec),"We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, to honor our history, to be proud, to be happy, to love and always to respect our great American flag. [Audience chants USA] And we believe in the words and always will, we are not changing it, they want us to change a lot of things it's not happening of our national motto in God we trust."
01:17:36 - 01:18:25 (50 sec),"In God we trust. These are traditions, customs and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the magnificent lands of Michigan. These are the values that brought the incredible people of this incredible state to Grand Rapids for the very last rally of the 2016 campaign, probably the most exciting and hopefully the most fruitful campaign in the history of our country."
01:18:25 - 01:19:01 (36 sec),"On that historic day you rejected the failed political establishment that chipped away your jobs, sold out your sovereignty and tied us down in endless foreign wars which we are now winning and getting out. You stood up to the corrupt special interest and you stood up to the rigged Washington power structure."
01:19:01 - 01:19:53 (51 sec),"You have stood with me. You watched this rigged power structure. You were with me. I won't forget it and you will be very proud looking back that you did it. Thank you. You took back your country. You recaptured your destiny. You defended your dignity and you proudly reclaimed your freedom, maybe for a second time."
01:19:53 - 01:20:46 (53 sec),"You have always been loyal to your nation and now you have a President who is loyal to you 100 percent. The Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted but with us you will never ever be forgotten again. You will never be taken for granted ever, ever, ever. I am fighting for you and your jobs in your life in your community with everything that I have and I will never ever stop and we are winning so big."
01:20:46 - 01:22:21 (95 sec),"Nobody ever thought it could happen. We will always fight on to victory. Together we are going to make our beautiful stand. We are going to stand for justice, for safety, for sovereignty and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people and one United States of America.Because together with the very proud and very truly incredible and inspiring people of Michigan we will make America wealthy again. And we are doing it. We will make America stronger again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michigan."
00:00:00 - 00:00:28 (28 sec),"Shabbat, Shalom. Thank you. What a great day. Thank you, Norm, for that wonderful introduction and for your leadership of this truly tremendous organization. So many friends, I have so many friends out in the audience. Thank you very much for being here. [Audience cheers] Thank you. Thank you. [Audience cheers] Thank you very much."
00:00:28 - 00:02:11 (103 sec),"He's going back home to mommy and he will be reprimanded, he will be, right. She gets it. I'm truly thrilled to be back with so many friends, supporters, patriots, at the annual conference of the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is now setting records. Records. Here today is someone who has been with us from the very beginning, a true fighter for our shared values, your terrific Executive Director Matt Brooks."
00:02:11 - 00:02:43 (32 sec),"Thank you, Matt, thank you. Thank you, Matt. Also joining us are two great leaders. You know very well my good friends Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, great people. They like you both, Sheldon, it's pretty good. Last year was my honor to award Miriam The Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's a big deal. I also want to thank Senator Lindsey Graham, he's here, senator."
00:02:43 - 00:03:50 (68 sec),"Where's Lindsey? Senator Lindsey, great man, great friend, great friend of Israel. Thank you, Lindsey. A man who fights all the time for Israel and for everything else. Another great Senator David Perdue, Georgia. Senator Kevin Cramer. Where's Kevin? Kevin, Kevin, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. He fought a battle, you wouldn't believe it. He beats somebody by 11 points, that was unbeatable."
00:03:50 - 00:04:22 (31 sec),"That's pretty good, Kevin. I said, ""You can do it."" That was my only thing. I said, ""You could do it."" He won by a lot. He won by a lot, and he's a great gentleman and he's a big, big fan and supporter of Israel. As well as a really terrific leader, he's our leader, Kevin McCarthy. And we have representatives that are outstanding."
00:04:22 - 00:05:06 (45 sec),"The great Billy Long. Where's Billy? Billy? Billy Long. Denver Riggleman. Denver, thank you. Thank you, Denver. Michael Waltz. Thank you, Michael. Great job you do, Mike. And a very good friend of mine also, Lee Zeldin. And a special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota. Oh, oh, I forgot. She doesn't like Israel, I forgot, I'm so sorry, oh. No, she doesn't like Israel, does she?"
00:05:06 - 00:05:45 (39 sec),"Oh, please, I apologize. A great friend of mine, one of the most successful men in the state, amazing guy, tremendous businessman, Mr. Phil Ruffin. Where is Phil? Phil? Thank you, Phil. A competitor of mine in Manhattan for a long time, always built great buildings, great architecture, was known for design and success, loves Israel, George Klein."
00:05:45 - 00:06:11 (26 sec),"Thank you, George. Thank you, George. So many friends in Israel. We're also grateful to be joined by members of my administration, including Jason Greenblatt, and a young man named Jared Kushner. He is fighting for Israel. Thank you very much, great job. Peace in the Middle East. If they can't do it, nobody can."
00:06:11 - 00:06:35 (24 sec),"David Friedman, your ambassador to Israel. He loves Israel, so an incredible job. Thank you, David. Finally, to every member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, thank you for your incredible support and your outstanding commitment to our country, to our safety, and to electing more Republicans. We need more Republicans, let's go so we can win everything."
00:06:35 - 00:07:07 (32 sec),"Over the next 19 months, I know that the Republican Jewish Coalition will help lead our party to another historic victory. And by the way, we did very well at 18, you can ask David and Lindsey, we won the Senate. We took on two more. There were three or four that were very close, that weren't supposed to be. All of a sudden that didn't happen and we're going to talk about that, I think, when we get back to Washington."
00:07:07 - 00:07:29 (22 sec),"But I'll tell you what, we picked up two Senate seats and now it's 53 to 47. And we have 53 great senators, and when it comes to appointments, when it comes to the United States Supreme Court, when it comes To approving all of the judges way over a hundred judges, federal judges, you need the Senate, we did well."
00:07:29 - 00:07:58 (29 sec),"They don't like to talk about that. They don't like. And I don't have enough time so many people in the house, but the people I went for, like in Kentucky, Matt Barr, he's -- he won. He was down and he won. We won so much. We won in Georgia, great Governor Brian Kemp. They had President Obama, they had Oprah, they had Michelle Obama."
00:07:58 - 00:08:17 (20 sec),"They were going for their new star, their new star of the party, and I was going for Brian. All he had was Trump. You know what, Brian won. Brian won. And the governor of a great state, known as Ohio, you have a great governor. He was not expected to win. He campaigned brilliantly. We did some incredible rallies."
00:08:17 - 00:08:55 (37 sec),"He won by almost seven points, he won easily. So Mike is great. And the governor of Florida. Governor of Florida. That was supposed to be a close race and was a tough race, but we won that one and Oklahoma, and many other places, we did so well. We get no credit, fake news, we get no credit. We get no credit, let's just keep winning."
00:08:55 - 00:09:26 (32 sec),"I'd rather have it that way they get too much credit and not win, that happens true to some people, doesn't happen to me. When I spoke to you as a candidate three years ago, America's economy was stagnant. Our military was depleted and the relationship between the United States and Israel was at probably the lowest point in history."
00:09:26 - 00:09:53 (26 sec),"How the hell did you support President Obama? How did you do? How did you do it? How do you support the Democrats with you guys [Inaudible]. I think, probably most of the people in this room that, ah, you love Israel, but you know, you look at the Iran deal. You look at so much that was done so negatively."
00:09:53 - 00:10:28 (35 sec),"Now, just three years later, I stand before you as the president of the United States to report on a very different situation under Republican leadership. America's economy is the hottest anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. Our military will soon be more powerful than ever before, $700 billion, $716 billion this year."
00:10:28 - 00:10:57 (29 sec),"I don't know, David and Lindsey, I think, probably in the 750 to 725 range, have to do it. You don't have the military. You owe the stuff, doesn't matter, does it, huh? You don't have to worry about inflation. You don't have to worry about anything. You got to have a strong, strong military. We'll have the strongest that we've ever had before."
00:10:57 - 00:11:26 (29 sec),"And the incredible bond between the United States and Israel has never been stronger than it is right now. America's thriving, America's booming, and America is winning, winning, winning like never before. We're respected again, we are respected again. It's been a long time. Since the election, we've created more than 5.5 million new jobs, including 600,000 manufacturing jobs."
00:11:26 - 00:12:14 (48 sec),"Things that nobody would have allowed me to say on the campaign trail. They would have said, ""Oh, he exaggerates."" After years of stagnation, wages are rising fast. Think of it, people had one job 21 years ago. They made more money in real dollars than they did two years ago, with three jobs, and two jobs, and now, for the first time, they have a choice, our economy so strong."
00:12:14 - 00:12:35 (21 sec),"They can have a choice of jobs and wages are going up, first time in many, many years. And one of the things that makes me happiest, frankly, is that they're going up most quickly for the lowest income Americans. Great. Great? Great. Our unemployment has reached the lowest level in more than 50 years and we will be breaking that record, I believe, pretty soon."
00:12:35 - 00:13:02 (26 sec),"We slashed 30,000 pages of job killing regulations from the federal register, an all time record. It doesn't matter if they were there for four years or eight years or 10 years, in one instance. We really did something. We had -- take a look at FDR, all of those years, all of those years. Nobody slashed them like as yet a fourth-termer."
00:13:02 - 00:13:36 (35 sec),"You have a lot of two-termers and in less than two years -- and I happen to believe that that was as important and maybe even more important than the largest tax cut in the history of our country. Thank you also. We're fixing broken trade deals, we're working on a trade deal now with China, we're doing very well, very well because of tariffs."
00:13:36 - 00:14:10 (34 sec),"We're making a deal that's very good, you'll, be happy if it happens, might not happen, but we have tremendous power. We have to tell our people that represent us in Washington that when countries -- I'm not talking about China, I'm talking about many countries. When they're charging us 100% tax or tariff."
00:14:10 - 00:15:09 (59 sec),"When they're charging us 200 and 250 and 300%, and we charge them nothing, it's OK to charge them something. Maybe you could explain that to some of your people that say, ""Oh, we don't like tariffs."" I mean, we have a case where a certain country, India, is charging us. We're a great country, a great friend, Prime Minister Modi charging us over a 100% for many things."
00:15:09 - 00:15:52 (43 sec),"We're charging them nothing for similar or the same product, and I have senators that say you can't do that. It's not free trade. Where do they come from? Where do they come from? It's not free trade. I don't know. Where's David? You got to work on this pretty well, David. You -- Where's Lindsey? He used to work on that."
00:15:52 - 00:16:32 (40 sec),"It's the craziest thing. Its stupid trade. We have so much stupid trade. We lost, for many years now, $800 billion a year on trade. Who the hell makes these deals? You're, probably saying yourself. Those are not good negotiators. Actually, Democrats made a lot of money, but Republicans met a lot of them too."
00:16:32 - 00:17:02 (29 sec),"That's amazing thing, they made a lot, 800 billion, but we're getting it back, we're getting it back. We're going to be getting a lot of it. One thing, if they let me really do my thing, we'd get it back, but I have to be a little bit politically correct by saying, ""It's OK if we lose 20 billion with a country."" You know, because we want to be nice, wouldn't it be nice to everybody."
00:17:02 - 00:17:27 (25 sec),"We're cracking down on countries that cheat. We're replacing NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA. NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made. You know, many of you, people have factories and plants, they're still empty. They signed NAFTA, and it was that great, big, sucking sound."
00:17:27 - 00:18:13 (46 sec),"Remember that? Remember that? Ross Perot, a great big, sucking sound, it's what happened. They left, they went to Mexico, they went to Canada, they went to a lot of places. It was a bad thing for us, but we'll be ending NAFTA, hopefully very soon, very soon. And one of the things in the new deal is that it's very difficult financially for a company to leave the United States, fire all of its employees, move, let's say, to Mexico or Canada, open up a new plant, make a product, sell it in for no tax, so we end up with unemployment and nothing but loss and empty factories."
00:18:13 - 00:18:48 (35 sec),"That's not happening anymore, folks, not happening. We've ended the war on American energy and the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, bigger than Russia and bigger than Saudi Arabia, can you believe that? Can you believe that? Three years. Thank you very much."
00:18:48 - 00:19:27 (40 sec),"And we're working now on getting pipelines approved in Texas that would normally take 10, 12, 14, 15 years to get approved, and we're trying to get him approve very rapidly. And if we do that, we're going to pick up another 20 to 25%, we'll be leading by so much. We already are leading by a lot. So it all happened over a very short period of time and we've confirmed more than 100 new federal judges to interpret the Constitution as [Inaudible] And as Norm said, and I appreciate that, so important, Norm."
00:19:27 - 00:20:07 (40 sec),"We have confirmed two incredible Supreme Court justices, Neil Gossage and Brett Kavanaugh. Don't let the Democrats take it away from us, they'll take it all away, they'll take it all away, including the judges. With the help of Republicans in Congress, we have secured record funding for our military. Our military is now going to be stronger than ever before."
00:20:07 - 00:20:38 (31 sec),"Ever. Not even close we're developing new weapons systems, we're developing things that nobody even thought of. Levels of technology that nobody else has with all of that being said, if we can be smart, and if China and Russia, and maybe one or two others, if necessary, can be smart, we'd all be saving a tremendous amount of money, and that's OK with me, but we will be so far in the lead."
00:20:38 - 00:21:06 (28 sec),"We always have to be in the lead and thanks to our focus on burden sharing, $100 billion, more dollars, will be coming this year to NATO, think of that. Other countries, in certain instances, were getting an almost free ride. We protect them and they're delinquent. You know, I used a real estate term for George Klein."
00:21:06 - 00:21:30 (24 sec),"He understands it. He understands. We were delinquent. They were delinquent. I said, ""You got to pay."" President Obama got -- made a nice speech, but he forgot to mention you got to pay. President Bush was wonderful, they didn't mention, you got to pay and you got to meet it, not just mentioned you got to mean it. I said you got to pay, because we're in a position."
00:21:30 - 00:22:19 (48 sec),"Everybody wants us, but how do you do that when people aren't paying? How do you do that? We feel foolish. We feel like fools. We're not going to be fools anymore. We've been a fool as a nation for so long, we're not going to be fools anymore. Last year I withdrew the United States from one of the most dangerous one-sided deals ever negotiated the disastrous Iran nuclear deal."
00:22:19 - 00:22:44 (26 sec),"They wanted to kill Israel, they wanted to destroy Israel. And maybe you could explain to the young man that just got taken out what it means when a country shouts as they're signing the deal Death to Israel. Maybe you could explain that to him. We've now imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian dictatorship, and it is not the same country it was when I took power."
00:22:44 - 00:23:10 (26 sec),"When I took over the presidency, I will tell you, one of the first meetings I had was at the Pentagon. Great generals, great people. I wanted a briefing on Iran with 14 different sites, they're all very, very dangerous, blow ups, all over. They were either behind it, hey had mercenaries, they had money or they had their own soldiers there all over the Middle East."
00:23:10 - 00:23:37 (27 sec),"It's a whole different story today, folks. They have riots in the streets. They have very little money coming in. A lot of things have changed. North Korea, we're getting along with North Korea. Let's see how it works out, but we have a good relationship. Don't forget, I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un. When I first came in, they were setting rockets and nuclear explosions and a lot of things were happening."
00:23:37 - 00:23:55 (18 sec),"I can't tell you what's going to happen, how to walk from the one deal. Was it going to be a right deal, but -- but we have a great relationship, we'll see what happens, I hope we're going to be able to do something. Maybe, maybe not, but I hope we're going to be able -- Relationship is very important, you know that very well."
00:23:55 - 00:24:30 (35 sec),"We're confronting the deadly menace of radical Islamic terrorism. When I took office, just over two years ago, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. I held up a map, it was so much red. Red, meaning, them. All red, showing the different sites. Today, the ISIS caliphate has been 100% obliterated."
00:24:30 - 00:25:03 (33 sec),"100%. And my previous generals said, ""That it was going to take, sir, it will take two years."" I flew to Iraq. I met a different group of generals, ""Sir, we can do it in one week."" I said, ""You could take a little longer than that."" They did it in a few weeks. They were -- They are great, right? Raisin Cain."
00:25:03 - 00:25:26 (23 sec),"He's name is Raisin. ""What's your first name?"" ""Raisin."" ""Raisin? What the hell kind of -- What's your last name?"", ""Cain."" ""Wait a minute,your name is Raising Cain? I like you as a general."" I think -- that it's what I want. Even Sheldon Adelson likes that decision. The kind of guy he'd have. I also took another historic action that had been decades in waiting."
00:25:26 - 00:26:11 (44 sec),"The United States recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Because, unlike other presidents, I keep my promises. Every president, for many decades, said they were going to do that, and I understand really why. Because when it was determined that maybe I'd do it, maybe there was a chance."
00:26:11 - 00:26:47 (36 sec),"The calls I got from leaders of other countries were unbelievable. Presidents, dictators, prime minister, kings, queens, everybody, my phone was ringing off the hook. So I knew I was going to do it, so I left a message. I said, ""I'm going to call you next week."" They said, ""Could we speak to him soon?"". ""No, no. No, he's not available."" They'll call it lying."
00:26:47 - 00:27:11 (25 sec),"The fake news will say, ""That's a horrible lie."" I want to be nice. ""No, no I'll call you next week. I look forward to it."" I had so many calls after this. It took me like three weeks to make all the calls, but I knew what they were calling about. So I did it. I did it. Then I started calling people back."
00:27:11 - 00:27:43 (31 sec),"King, how are you, how have you been? ""I called you last week."" ""So what's up?"" ""Well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel and the embassy in Jerusalem."" I said, ""Look, I'm sorry, wish I would've known. I did it, I did it yesterday."" Right, it's much easier, but I now know why other president -- I don't really hold it against him other than they didn't keep their promise, right?"
00:27:43 - 00:28:15 (33 sec),"They didn't keep their promise, David. So that's the way it is, and we got you something that you wanted. I can tell you, Sheldon and Miriam, that is the most important thing, I think, that's ever happened in their life. They love Israel. So, I can now understand, because I always said, ""Why wouldn't they do it, why?"
00:28:15 - 00:28:48 (32 sec),"Why are they doing it? Why wouldn't they just do it?"" They campaign, ""We will do this and that -- Israel, Israel."" Then you folks go out and vote for them and then they don't do it, right? Four years, eight years, didn't matter, they won't do it, but you know what, they did it. We did a great job and we feel great about it. And then last week, Israel security, really so important."
00:28:48 - 00:29:20 (32 sec),"It's all about security, when you get right down, it's about security, so is No. 1 for me. I got to talk. We can talk healthcare we could talk a hundred different things without security. What does it matter? I stood with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyahu. How is the race going by the way? How is it? Who is going to win the race?"
00:29:20 - 00:29:44 (25 sec),"Tell me, I don't know. Well, it's gonna be close. I think it's gonna be close. Two good people, two good people. But I stood with the prime minister at the White House to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights is something I've been hearing about for a long time, the Golan Heights."
00:29:44 - 00:30:11 (26 sec),"So, I just talked to your Ambassador Friedman and not about this, they've been trying to get that approved, as you know, for 52 years they wanted recognition from the United States of the Golan Heights. They had 32 summits, meetings, big meetings over many, many decades about the Golan Heights. I'm talking to your ambassador."
00:30:11 - 00:30:43 (33 sec),"Gerard was there, Jason Greenblatt was there. I said, ""Fellas, do me a favor, give me a little -- a little history, quick, wanna go fast."" I got a lot of things I'm working on, China, North Korea. Give me a quickie. Norm, I said, ""Give me a quick little slice -- so I know it as well as Norm, but I don't want to spend quite as much time as he has spent studying it, but -- which has been his entire life, right?"
00:30:43 - 00:31:05 (22 sec),"So that 32 different summits, he starts going well. We need that as a high point, we need it for protection we need it for -- I said, I could -- How do you like the idea? They weren't even calling about this. How do you like the idea of me recognizing exactly what we're discussing? Because I agree, you need it. You need to hide, you need to hide."
00:31:05 - 00:31:41 (36 sec),"The great generals said, ""Always fight downhill. Never fight, uphill."" Battles are lost, for these generals want to fight uphill, right? You need to hide. So I said, ""David, what do you think about me recognizing Israel and the Golan Heights?"" He said, ""Would you actually do?"" It is a great deal because one of the most successful lines was gave it all up. In order to be your ambassador gave it all up. ""What do you think of it David?"" And he goes -- and this is a very strong, ambitious guy."
00:31:41 - 00:32:19 (38 sec),"He like it like a wonderful, beautiful baby, he said, ""Do you really -- You would do that, sir?"" I see -- I think, I'm doing it right now. Let's write something out. We make fast decisions and we make good decisions. Look, I made -- I made a lot of good decisions, I make good decisions and we get something beautiful talking about security."
00:32:19 - 00:33:04 (44 sec),"Talking about the greatness of Israel and I went, ""Bing, it was done."" Then I watched well look at all those cameras. Then I watched the fake news and they said, ""We have breaking news. President Trump has just committed to the Golan Heights."" And it was a big big story for two days. Everyone's happy, no repercussions and there won't be. I went there to protect Israel, so there won't be. We did the right thing, we did the right thing."
00:33:04 - 00:33:21 (18 sec),"And I want to congratulate Jared, and Jason Greenblatt, and david Friedman and all of the people they work with. And a big thing for me, and some of you won't like this maybe, but I would love to see peace in the Middle East, I would love to see peace in the Middle East. And if those three can't do it, you'll never have it done."
00:33:21 - 00:33:50 (28 sec),"It's never -- with me as president, with them doing the deal, you'll never have it done, so let's see if we can do it, who knows. Under my administration, the United States will always support Israel's right to self-defense. At the United Nations we no longer tolerate any form of anti-American, anti Israel, and anti-Semitic bias."
00:33:50 - 00:34:22 (32 sec),"We don't do it. For example, the United Nations Human Rights Council has repeatedly denigrated America and Israel. Why -- and you know this you've heard this while ignoring the world's worst human-rights abusers. That's why I withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights Council, and thank you to Nikki."
00:34:22 - 00:35:21 (60 sec),"Thank you to Nikki. Terrific job, Nikki Haley. With your help, we are making incredible strides on behalf of the American people and we are just getting started. [Audience cheers] Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And that guy that just said that, he used to hate me. Can you believe that? He used to hate me. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. But while Republicans fight to protect the jobs and safety of all Americans, Democrats are advancing the most extreme partisan agenda by far in American history."
00:35:21 - 00:36:10 (48 sec),"You see what's happening. You see what's happening. People aren't fighting for Israel in Congress, large numbers of people. You saw what took place three weeks ago. It was shocking that couldn't have happened. It could not have happened just a few years ago, could not have happened. If implemented, the Democrats radical agenda would destroy our economy, cripple our country, and very well could leave Israel out there all by yourselves, can't do that more than 100 Democrats in Congress are promoting the biggest government power grab in U.S history."
00:36:10 - 00:36:56 (46 sec),"The $100 trillion Green New Deal, proposed by a wonderful young bartender, 29 years old, 29. No, I like her, she's 29 years old. We take trains to Europe, Hawaii and Australia. That's a problem. The farming business is in big trouble, right. The auto business you get one car, somehow Detroit etc., you know bring in so many car companies in. I don't think they're going to be thrilled to hear that."
00:36:56 - 00:37:14 (18 sec),"We are -- we're built -- I tell you what, when you look at what's happening with the car companies, they're opening up in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and South Carolina, it's amazing, what's happening, we want to keep it going. You know, they could destroy what we've built very quickly."
00:37:14 - 00:37:43 (29 sec),"It does it -- that's why having Lindsey and David and all of the people that I mentioned, and so many more back in Washington really want to stop it, and we've got to win the election, we're going to win it, we're going to win a big. It will never be as easy as it looks. Over 120 congressional Democrats are also supporting a socialist takeover of our healthcare system that would take away private insurance."
00:37:43 - 00:38:11 (28 sec),"If you take a look at this, 180 million people will lose their private health insurance. And you're finally happy, you're happy. We've done a lot of work on that, you're happy. The radical Democrats are also pushing for a thing called -- If you can believe this, open borders. They want open borders, they want people to pour into our country."
00:38:11 - 00:38:42 (31 sec),"Last month, more than 100,000 illegal migrants were apprehended at our border. Apprehended. Think of this, hundreds of thousands of people. And we're on pace to apprehend more than a million illegal migrants this year, a million they're coming up because of the economy they're coming up because our laws are so bad from the Democrats."
00:38:42 - 00:39:09 (27 sec),"Catch and release you catch 'em and you release 'em. Oh, that's wonderful. If they put one foot on our territory, if they start climbing a fence and they're on the Mexico side. Welcome to the United States, think of it. It's the craziest thing. They have a visa lottery. Democrats, a visa lottery, a lottery, countries, a lottery."
00:39:09 - 00:39:53 (43 sec),"You pick out a name. Do you think they're putting their finest? Do you think they're putting their great people there? No and then people come in and you see what happens with the crime and murders, 4,000 murders last year, four thousand. How stupid can we be to put up with this? How stupid can we be? And the asylum program is a scam, some of the roughest people you've ever seen, people that looked like they should be fighting for the UFC."
00:39:53 - 00:40:23 (30 sec),"They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place, you know, my lawyers, they tell them what to say. You look at this guy, you say, ""Wow, that's a tough cookie."" I am very fearful for my life. I am very worried that I will be accosted if I was sent back home. No, no he'll do the acoustic."
00:40:23 - 00:40:59 (36 sec),"Asylum. Oh, give him asylum, he's afraid, he's afraid. We don't love the fact that he's got tattoos on his face, that's not a good sign. We don't love the fact that he's carrying the flag of Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador only to say he's petrified to be in his country. To confront this border crisis, I declared a national emergency."
00:40:59 - 00:41:29 (30 sec),"And David Perdue and Lindsey Graham helped me, a lot of people helped us. When congressional Democrats tried to reverse my order and terminate vital border security operations, I very proudly issued my first veto and they were not able to turn over the veto. So now we have -- in fact we have billions of dollars."
00:41:29 - 00:41:52 (24 sec),"We've started building walls -- actually, a while ago, from the first 1.6 billion and renovation of a lot of walls, we can do that a lot cheaper. We had walls that were potentially very good, but they were in very bad shape, they were old, we renovated it. We have got a tremendous amount, we're going to put out list, but we will have hundreds of miles before the end of next year."
00:41:52 - 00:42:29 (37 sec),"Hundreds of miles. And yesterday I traveled to the border in Calexico, California, and I saw a section of brand new 30 foot high steel wall, you want to be able to see through it. Got to see through it, got to see who's on the other side, beautiful wall, looks great, looks great. Walls build good neighbors, right."
00:42:29 - 00:42:48 (19 sec),"Now we we have to take care of ourselves and I have to say I said I was going to close the border. It's gotten so bad. I said we're closing the border and as soon as I said that, and I really thank the president of Mexico because they stepped up and now they are apprehending people on their southern border."
00:42:48 - 00:43:27 (39 sec),"Coming in from Honduras, El Salvador, and various other places,Guatemala and I stopped paying almost $600 million to those three countries. Now I got a lot of heat. The Democrats say, ""How dare you do that?"" That money is used for all these good, but no it's not it's largely stolen. I sent 600 million, we do, 600 million to three countries and they form caravans."
00:43:27 - 00:44:00 (33 sec),"Now, if the government wanted to, I have a feeling they'd be able to stop caravans from forming in those three countries. I have a feeling they're, pretty tough they're, pretty tough ad, but they did say, stop the payment. Do you mind? Are you okay with it? Because I've taken -- I've taken a lot of heat from the stupid people that say, ""Oh gee, we should keep..."" We have people that work with them that say we should be sending much more money."
00:44:00 - 00:44:22 (22 sec),"We should be building things they're, helping them. What about building our own country for a change? Wouldn't that be nice? Unfortunately, Democrats have refused to close immigration loopholes, that's really what it's all about. And again, Mexico is apprehended 14,000 people yesterday, a thousand people today, before they've never done this."
00:44:22 - 00:44:45 (23 sec),"Never to the extent, and I appreciate it, I appreciate it, but if they don't do it, I'm going to close the border or I'm going to do tariffs or the cars made in Mexico. They took 30% of our car business, by the way, I wasn't here when that happened, OK. I used to complain about it as a civilian. I complain, I said, ""What the hell is going on? They're taking our business."" They have 30% of our cars."
00:44:45 - 00:45:14 (30 sec),"They make 30% of our cars, they send them into our country, no tax, no nothing, essentially, and we lost a lot of jobs, but we're getting them all back now, we're getting more back. But I said we're either going to tariff those cars coming in at 25%, which is a tremendous amount of money. It's all about the cars, the cars are a big deal or we're going to close the border, and I will say this, Mexico has been great."
00:45:14 - 00:45:35 (21 sec),"The last four or five days, they've been great, first time first time. At the heart of, and I don't mind, closing the border. I'd say, you know, a lot of these fakers back there they say, ""He will never close the border."" It's too much. Well, you know, close the border. We stop about $500 billion worth of drugs from pouring into our country."
00:45:35 - 00:46:16 (41 sec),"You know, there are a lot of advantages too, a lot of advantages. I'm OK with it. I don't want to do it, but I'm OK with it, I'll do it. I'll do whatever is necessary to stop an invasion of our country. That's what it is. At the heart of the crisis are the 9th Circuit rulings in the Flores case and the Trafficking Victims, Protection Reauthorization Act, driving a staggering surge of illegal families and minors into the hands of our incredible border patrol people."
00:46:16 - 00:46:41 (25 sec),"They've done an incredible job. What they do is incredible, I was with them yesterday. So Congress must end catch-and-release so that illegal border crossers can be quickly and safely returned to their home. Get out. Sorry, get out, sorry, can't handle it. And I told my people yesterday, our country's full, we're full."
00:46:41 - 00:47:17 (35 sec),"Our systems full, our country is full, can't come in, our country is full. What can you do? We can't handle anymore? Our country is full, can't come in, I'm sorry, it's very simple. Never before has a major political party been more outside the American mainstream than the Democrats of today. They have become the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, witch hunts, and delusions."
00:47:17 - 00:47:45 (28 sec),"And now the Democrats have even allowed the terrible scorch of anti-Semitism to Take root in their party and in their country, they have allowed that, they have allowed that. House Democrats recently blocked legislation to confront the anti-Semitic movement to boycott and sanction Israel. Nobody could believe it, right."
00:47:45 - 00:48:15 (30 sec),"Nobody. You couldn't believe it. Republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism. We do, all of us. Earlier this year, I appointed a new special envoy to monitor and combat Anti-Semitism. We are grateful that he has joined us today, Elan Carr. Where is Elan? Thank you, great job, Elan."
00:48:15 - 00:48:47 (32 sec),"Elan is as good as I hear, he's going to do a great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Congratulations. At my State of the Union address. I was honored to have as our guest a Pittsburgh SWAT officer, brave guy. I was with him in the hospital who raced into gunfire during the horrific anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue."
00:48:47 - 00:49:48 (61 sec),"He was shot seven times badly injured. He endured 12 surgeries and he's gonna have to endure quite a few more. We are proud to have him here with us right now. If he wasn't there as bad as it was, as horrible as it was, it would have been much worse. He is a brave man, Timothy Mattson. Please stand, Timothy."
00:49:48 - 00:50:14 (26 sec),"Timothy. I saw him right after this horrible event, this horrible happening, and he was laying in the hospital he had bullet wounds all over, he's a massive guy. I looked at the chest, I mean, he's got like this and it's muscle. Thank God, you're massive and thank God, you had a lot of muscle because very few people got to take it when you took Timothy, and your friends had such respect for him."
00:50:14 - 00:50:44 (29 sec),"His fellow officers they had such respect. Thank you. Glad to see you better. That's great. Glad to see you better. Amazing what he what he went through. Today we also honor two more American heroes, Mordechai Lichtenstein and [Inaudible], I love that name. Both from Brooklyn. I know Brooklyn very well, my father Fred Trump, I loved my father."
00:50:44 - 00:51:14 (30 sec),"Brooklyn. Spent a lot of time in Brooklyn. You learn a lot in Brooklyn. You get through Brooklyn, you got to be smart. Two years ago, Mordechai and [Inaudible] traveled to Jerusalem, where they prayed at the Western Wall. Soon after they left the holy site, they saw a terrorist stabbing an innocent Israeli police officer, racing to the scene."
00:51:14 - 00:51:57 (43 sec),"Mordechai pull the attacker off the soldier and was about to be stabbed himself. It was happening when the badly wounded officer summoned the little strength that he had left and shot and killed this very violent terrorist. [Inaudible]] immediately took his prayer shot and wrapped it around the officer's wounds to stop the bleeding, which was profuse after the attack, the officer said of the two Jewish Americans."
00:51:57 - 00:52:41 (45 sec),"They were sent by God to save my life. For me, my family and the Druze people of Israel. I thank God from the bottom of my heart. That's the officer, thank you, Mordechai, [Inaudible], where are you? Stand up. Great job, thank you. Great job, great job. Thank you very much. Recently, Mordechai and [Inaudible] became the first non-Israeli citizens to receive the country's civil, exemplary declaration."
00:52:41 - 00:53:17 (36 sec),"That's a big deal. To Mordechai and [Inaudible] you are an inspiration to all of us to everyone in this room to everyone in our country. Thank you very much. The three American heroes we recognize today are a powerful reminder of the timeless values that bind us together. As one nation, and that forge deep and lasting friendship with the people of Israel, we honor our history."
00:53:17 - 00:54:22 (65 sec),"We treasure our traditions, we cherish life, we love our families, we defend our sovereignty, we fight for our freedom and we place our trust in the hands of Almighty God. These are values that unite us all as Republicans as citizens, as patriots, and as proud Americans. Every day of my presidency, we fight on behalf of hardworking citizens who pay their taxes, follow our laws, raise their children, protect our communities and make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of earth."
00:54:22 - 00:55:08 (45 sec),"This government is their government, and this land is home. These American patriots have always been loyal to our country, and we will forever be loyal we swear to them. The choice for our country's future has never been clearer than it is today. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans. It will be the party for great healthcare, you watch."
00:55:08 - 00:55:44 (36 sec),"We are the party of the American worker, we are the party of the American family and we are the party of the American dream. Alongside our friends at the Republican Jewish Coalition, we will keep on working. We will keep on fighting and we will be winning, winning, winning for the American people. With your help on November 3, 2020. Can you believe?"
00:55:44 - 00:56:19 (35 sec),"It's right around the corner. Think of it. Right around the corner. [Crowd cheering.] Thank you very much. We're going to win. By the way. One of the people, and then that was confirmed by somebody else today on the other side Democrats were saying that they would reinstate -- just reinstate the Iran nuclear deal."
00:56:19 - 00:56:51 (32 sec),"Well, this is what you have. They want to reinstate the deal. It was a disaster for our country. We gave $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. What does that look like? Airplanes loaded up with cash, how stupid was that deal, they want to reinstate it. Republicans are going to win the White House, we're going to retake the House."
00:56:51 - 00:57:20 (29 sec),"We're going to keep the Senate and we are once again going to be in a position, in my opinion, like never ever before, stronger than we've ever been before. There is more spirit for the Republican Party right now than I've ever seen. They keep talking about the spirit of the Democrat Party, there's more spirit for Republicans."
00:57:20 - 00:58:08 (48 sec),"In my opinion, by far, we may express it somewhat differently and that's OK, more spirit than I have ever seen, and I've now been doing this for a little while, not too long. I'm one for one, that's one for one. I want to be two for two and then relax. Together with the love, the prayers, and devotion of everyone in this room, incredible people and the millions of patriots across our land, we will make America great again for all Americans greater than ever before."
00:58:08 - 00:58:13 (5 sec),"Thank you, and God bless you all. God bless America. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:25 (25 sec),"Well, you better love me; I kept this place open, that I can tell you. They said, ""We're closing it."" And I said, ""No, we're not."" And now you're doing record business. The job you do is incredible. And I'm thrilled to be here in Ohio with the hardworking men and women of Lima."
00:00:25 - 00:00:43 (18 sec),And this is some tank plant. There's nothing like it in the world. You make the finest equipment in the world. You really know what you're doing. They just gave me a little briefing on a couple of those tanks. I want to get into them but then I remember when a man named Dukakis got into a tank.
00:00:43 - 00:00:59 (17 sec),"[Laughter] And I remember him; he tanked when he got into the tank. [Laughter] He tanked -- I never saw anybody tank like that. So I said, maybe I'll -- but I'm a little bigger than him; I think it probably would work out okay. How would I look in a tank? Okay? Yeah, not bad. Not bad."
00:00:59 - 00:01:26 (27 sec),"The helmet was bigger than he was. That was not good. [Laughter] We're here today to celebrate a resounding victory for all of you, for northwest Ohio, and for our great military, and for our entire country. Incredible victory. After so many years of budget cuts and layoffs, today, jobs are coming back and pouring back, frankly, like never before."
00:01:26 - 00:01:59 (33 sec),"Companies are coming back into our country; they want the action. Production is ramping up in the biggest way. And the awesome M1 Abrams tank is once again thundering down the assembly line. A-1. I want to thank Acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan. He's done an incredible job. In fact, ISIS -- let me tell you about ISIS."
00:01:59 - 00:02:01 (2 sec),They're not doing so well.
00:02:01 - 00:02:20 (19 sec),"You know, we took over the caliphate. You'll see it tonight. When I came in, it was a mess. Where the hell is that chart? [Laughter] Folks, they gave me all economic charts. They didn't give me the ISIS chart. But if you did -- bring it up if anybody has it. Bring it up. When I took over, it was a mess. They were all over the place."
00:02:20 - 00:02:42 (21 sec),"All over the -- all over Syria and Iraq. And you'd see it was a sea of red. And now you look at it and there's no red. No red. And you look at some of the economic numbers; nobody thought we'd ever see numbers like that in our country -- not a for a long time, not for ever. And what we're doing has been incredible."
00:02:42 - 00:03:07 (25 sec),"What you're doing has been more incredible. You stuck it out and now you've got one of the most successful military plants anywhere in the world. It's great. So thank you very much, Pat Shanahan. Also thank you to the Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper. He's been fantastic. Thank you. Oh, good."
00:03:07 - 00:03:23 (17 sec),"Better late than never. [Laughter] Here's the story: So, you know, I donât want to have them make a big chart because it costs too much. You know, I'm a business guy. They said, ""Sir, we could make a big chart."" I said, ""How much does it cost?"" Like it matters. But it matters to me. Does that make sense to you?"
00:03:23 - 00:03:23 (0 sec),[Audience calls out Yeah]
00:03:23 - 00:04:03 (40 sec),"So, two maps, identical -- except the one on top was Syria. See that? The one on top was Syria in November of '16. You remember that date? November of '16. November 8th. We had a little victory that night. We had a little victory. But a lot of us werenât surprised by it, but the other side said, ""Where did all of those people come from?"" [Laughter] And I said, ""They just didn't like candidates for a lot of years."
00:04:03 - 00:04:28 (25 sec),"They didnât vote."" So what happens is -- this is all ISIS. Now, on the bottom -- that's as of today -- this is ISIS. There's none. The caliphate is gone, as of tonight. Pretty good. Thatâs pretty good, right? We took over a mess. We took over a mess with North Korea. We took over a mess in the Middle East."
00:04:28 - 00:04:46 (18 sec),"We took over. A lot of bad things were happening and the economy was not doing well. It was heading in the wrong direction. You remember that. It was going to go bad, and then we opened up with the regulation cuts and all of the other things we've done, including the big tax cut. But it made a big difference."
00:04:46 - 00:05:10 (24 sec),"Made a big difference. And we'll show you some numbers in a little while. I want to also thank Major General Brian Cummings for the incredible leadership and service you have done. An unbelievable job. Thank you, Brian. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're also honored to be joined by several of the Ohio leaders, friends of mine -- terrific people: Senator Rob Portman."
00:05:10 - 00:05:46 (36 sec),"Rob, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Rob. A man who I will never, I promise, wrestle. He was one of the best wrestlers in the history of college wrestling. His record is so ridiculously good. I said, ""Were you as good as Dan Gable?"" He said, ""No."" See, if it were me, I wouldâve said, ""Yes, I was much better."" [Laughter] You know who Dan Gable is. Jim Jordan, a great guy."
00:05:46 - 00:06:11 (25 sec),"And a great champion. A great, great athlete. Great champion. Thank you. He is tough. You'll want to have him on your side. Another one you want on your side always is Mike Turner. Mike, thank you. Thank you, Mike. Great. Warren Davidson. Warren, thank you. And, Bob Latta, thank you very much."
00:06:11 - 00:06:45 (34 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Warren and Bob. And a man who we're very proud of because, along with Mike, he ran a great race: Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted. He ran a great race for Governor. We came in that final day -- they were a little bit down, against a tough opponent, who I was not a big fan of, and I didnât like the people that were supporting him too much -- Pocahontas and others."
00:06:45 - 00:07:01 (16 sec),"[Laughter] And I came that final day, and we had a day that was incredible and they won by -- what did you win by? Six or seven points, right? It was an incredible -- huh? Even higher. Thatâs pretty good. Good. I'll see Mike in a little while. Thatâs great. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Proud of you."
00:07:01 - 00:07:29 (28 sec),"To our plant leaders, Lieutenant Colonel Travis Adkins and Henry Kennedy -- we appreciate everything you do to keep the Army âRolling Alongâ full speed ahead. Incredible job. We're grateful to General Dynamics -- incredible company -- Phebe Novakovic. How did I do with that one?"
00:07:29 - 00:08:01 (32 sec),"Novak-ovic. It's a little tricky, but thatâs okay. What a job you do. Thank you. Great job. Thank you for the tour, too. And the hardworking members of the United Auto Workers. Now, you've got to get over to a place that I like a lot, Lordstown. And you've got to get that. You know, the only place -- General -- what's going on with General Motors?"
00:08:01 - 00:08:20 (19 sec),We have the best economy we've ever had. We have the lowest employment -- unemployment that we've had in 51 years; soon will be the record of all time. And what's going on with General Motors? Get that plant open or sell it to somebody and theyâll open it. Everybody wants it. Sell it to somebody or open it yourselves.
00:08:20 - 00:08:43 (23 sec),"Get it going now and the UAW will help you. The UAW -- you're going to help. The UAW just promised they're going to help. Get it open now. Don't wait. They said they have discussions coming up in September, October. I said, why not tomorrow? Why not on Monday? What do you have to wait months for?"
00:08:43 - 00:09:05 (22 sec),"Get the discussions going. Get it open. Lordstown is a great area. I guess I like it because I won so big there. [Laughter] But we're doing a job, and this state has been -- we're very proud of what's happened in Ohio under our federal auspices. We've gotten so many things done, and this plant is one of our great achievements."
00:09:05 - 00:09:47 (42 sec),"To all of our active-duty service members and our wonderful veterans, thank you for serving your country -- with such tremendous distinction and honor. And to every welder, and machinist, and assembler, and mechanic, and engineer, and electrician, and carpenter, and every patriot here at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center: Thank you for pouring out your heart and your sweat and your soul to help restore the might of the American military, which very soon will be stronger than it ever was."
00:09:47 - 00:10:16 (29 sec),"We've bought billions and billions of dollars' worth of new planes and tanks and many other things. So, thank you all. Great job. And the fact is we have the best tanks driven by the best soldiers, made by the best workers anywhere in the world. And thatâs true. A lot of people are asking, because they love me, and they ask me about a man named John McCain."
00:10:16 - 00:10:21 (5 sec),"And if you want, I could tell you about -- should I or not? Yes? Yes? [Audience calls out Yes]"
00:10:21 - 00:10:51 (30 sec),"So, I have to be honest: I've never liked him much. Hasnât been for me. I've really -- probably never will. But there are certain reasons for it, and I'll tell you. And I do this to save a little time with the press later on. John McCain received a fake and phony dossier. Did you hear about the dossier? It was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton."
00:10:51 - 00:10:53 (2 sec),Right? [Audience Boos]
00:10:53 - 00:11:14 (21 sec),"And John McCain got it. He got it. And what did he do? He didnât call me. He turned it over to the FBI, hoping to put me in jeopardy. And that's not the nicest thing to do. You know, when those people say -- because I'm a very loyal person. John McCain campaigned for years to repeal and replace Obamacare -- for years, in Arizona."
00:11:14 - 00:11:40 (26 sec),"A great state. I love the people of Arizona. But he campaigned, for years, for ""repeal and replace."" So did Rob and so did a lot of senators. When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against ""repeal and replace."" He voted against, at 2 o'clock in the morning. Remember ""thumbs down""? We said, ""What the hell happened?"" He said, two hours before, he was voting to repeal and replace."
00:11:40 - 00:12:08 (28 sec),"And then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican Party, badly hurting our nation, and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable healthcare. We would've had it. This would've saved our country over a trillion dollars in entitlements, and we would have ended up making a great healthcare plan, frankly, with the Democrats because they would have had no choice."
00:12:08 - 00:12:41 (33 sec),"McCain didnât get the job done for our great vets and the VA, and they knew it. That's why, when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got Choice and I got Accountability. Accountability -- meaning, if somebody mistreats our vets -- for 45 years they were trying -- they mistreat our vets, and we say, ""Hey, you're fired."
00:12:41 - 00:13:01 (20 sec),"Get out."" You can't mistreat our vets. They never got it done. And Choice -- for year and years, decades, they wanted to get Choice. You know what Choice is. You're a military person. You're one of our great people. To me, one of the great people. For many decades, they couldnât get it done."
00:13:01 - 00:13:26 (25 sec),"It was never done. I got it five months ago. I got it done -- Choice. Instead of waiting in line -- a vet fought for us, fought in these tanks; fought for us. Instead of waiting in line for two days, two weeks, two months -- people on line, they're not very sick. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill."
00:13:26 - 00:13:53 (27 sec),"We gave them Choice. If you have to wait for any extended period of time, you go outside, you go to a local doctor. We pay the bill; you get yourself better. Go home to your family. And we got it passed. We got it done. And the other thing is we're in a war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush -- President Bush -- all the time: ""Get into the Middle East."
00:13:53 - 00:14:20 (27 sec),"Get into the Middle East."" So now we're into that war for $7 trillion. Thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we're straightening it out now, but it's been a disaster for our country. We've spent tremendous wealth -- tremendous wealth -- and tremendous lives in that war."
00:14:20 - 00:14:42 (23 sec),"And what do we have? It's worse than it was 19 years ago. I call them the ""endless wars."" Nineteen years ago, when we started. So, John McCain loved it. I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted -- which, as President, I had to approve. I donât care about this. I didnât get ""thank you."" That's okay."
00:14:42 - 00:15:06 (24 sec),"We sent him on the way. But I wasnât a fan of John McCain. So now, what we could say is: Now we're all set. I donât think I have to answer that question, but the press keeps, ""What do you think of McCain? What do you think?"" Not my kind of guy. But some people like him, and I think that's great. Now let's get back and let's get on to the subject of tanks and this economy."
00:15:06 - 00:15:41 (35 sec),"Because you know what? We love what we are and what we do more than anything else. We build great, we fight great, and we're right now in Lima, and Lima is an incredible place, a place of strength and dedication. Since 1941, this plant has built and serviced thousands of tanks and military vehicles that powered American forces through World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan."
00:15:41 - 00:16:14 (34 sec),"And the tanks are the best in the world -- better than ever before. Every single Abrams tank in existence -- the steel and the aluminum warhorse; theyâre really a warhorse of American ground forces -- it was built or serviced on these very grounds by you people. By you people. But under the previous administration, this tank factory -- the last of its kind anywhere in the Western Hemisphere -- came very close to shutting down."
00:16:14 - 00:16:40 (26 sec),"Four straight years, the number of U.S. tanks that were budgeted for upgrades was zero. Does anybody remember that? Raise your hands. Do you remember that? Zero. That was under your great President Obama. Our military readiness declined and your workforce was slashed by 60 percent. But those days are over."
00:16:40 - 00:17:09 (29 sec),"We are rebuilding the American military. We are restoring American manufacturing. And we are once again fighting for our great American workers. Over the last two years, we have secured nearly $1.5 trillion to provide our warfighters the finest aircraft, ships, missiles, and tanks anywhere on Earth. We make the best equipment on Earth."
00:17:09 - 00:17:38 (29 sec),"And we sell that equipment, as you know, to good allies. Although, sometimes the good ones turn out to be not so good, and then we do something. We figure it out. You know what you have to do? You figure it out. This year, weâre asking for an additional $750 billion, which is a record. That includes funding to upgrade more than 160 mighty M1 Abrams tanks."
00:17:38 - 00:18:12 (33 sec),"Congratulations. Congratulations. These historic investments are making America safer and our workforce stronger. From the awe-inspiring F-35 fighter in Texas to the Ford-class aircraft carriers in Virginia -- weâre now building the largest aircraft carrier anywhere in the world. In fact, Iâm hearing itâs actually the largest ship ever built."
00:18:12 - 00:18:40 (29 sec),"It is seriously big. I was there recently. Itâs something -- itâs like landing at an airport, although you have to be very talented, still, to land on those decks, no matter how you figure it. Some people can do it and some people can't. Some very good pilots can. To advance missile defense systems in Alabama, American workers are building the most cutting-edge, modern, and powerful military anywhere on the planet."
00:18:40 - 00:19:02 (22 sec),"At the heart of our military rebuilding is our investment in the legendary M1 Abrams tank. And I will tell you, the investment has paid off because the technology is so -- if you look at this tank from now, and you go back 10 years and look at the tank, itâs a like a whole different -- itâs a whole different deal, isnât it? A whole different deal."
00:19:02 - 00:19:24 (22 sec),"Over the next three years, weâre investing more than $6 billion in upgrades and modifications to these tanks -- thatâs going to keep you very busy here -- almost twice the amount spent in the entire eight years of the previous administration, which was going down to nothing. Because you were closed; this place was closed."
00:19:24 - 00:19:45 (22 sec),"And I heard about it. And I got calls from Jim Jordan and Rob, and everybody, saying, âYou just canât do this.â And after I studied the situation, I said, âWeâre not only not going to close in Lima, weâre going to expand.â And thatâs what took place. So you owe a lot to a lot of your great political leaders."
00:19:45 - 00:20:21 (36 sec),"Our investment -- our investment in you is also a tremendous win for American taxpayers. By modernizing this plant and accelerating production, we will bring the cost down by 20 percent, saving taxpayers nearly $3 million on every single tank. Thatâs not bad. With the help of everyone in this room, we are giving our warriors the most effective, reliable, and lethal battle tank in the history of war."
00:20:21 - 00:20:52 (31 sec),"Would you say thatâs correct? So how does this compare with the tanks made in China and Russia and other places? What do you think? Can we take them? They say itâs much better. America does not need conflict. But if conflict comes, and you know the story -- youâve got to be strong if conflict comes -- we will dominate the battlefield, and we will win, win, win."
00:20:52 - 00:21:30 (38 sec),"Weâre now set up to win, win, win. When I came in, we had some big problems. You look at what weâve done on so many fronts. And we actually have better relationships. They respect our country more than theyâve ever respected it. Our country is respected again. The United States is respected again. To help meet our military needs, I am very proud to report that 400 new jobs are coming here to Lima, compared to just a few years ago, and weâre doubling the size of your workforce."
00:21:30 - 00:22:00 (30 sec),"We need to. Our investment will also support thousands of additional jobs across our nation to assemble these incredible Abrams tanks. The engines are from Alabama, transmissions are from Indiana, special armor from Idaho, and the 120-millimeter gun -- and the gun parts from upstate New York and from Pennsylvania."
00:22:00 - 00:22:46 (45 sec),"All great places. In Ohio alone, almost 200 suppliers churn out parts and materials that go into every tank that rolls off this factoryâs floor. Incredible. What you achieve here at this plant is truly remarkable. And equally remarkable is that they wanted to close it. No good. Every day you start with a powerful, heavy, but sometimes rust-covered, hollowed-out hull -- and with incredible skill and extraordinary care -- you restore its unmatched power, strength, and glory with all brand new equipment inside."
00:22:46 - 00:23:19 (33 sec),"The best in the world. The amazing restorations you accomplish every day are a perfect symbol for what we're doing with American manufacturing all across our nation. And we just came out -- another chart -- we just came out with numbers -- the Economic Report of the President: 3.1 percent GDP. The first time in 14 years that we cracked 3, right?"
00:23:19 - 00:23:43 (24 sec),"That's pretty good -- 3.1. The press tried to make it 2.9. I said, ""It's not 2.9."" What they did is they took odd months. I said, ""No, no, no. You go from January to December. You don't take certain months and add them up."" Because I said, ""We're going to break 3."" And we did. We did 3.1. The fake news tried to change it but we caught them."
00:23:43 - 00:24:15 (32 sec),"[Laughter] I said -- I said, ""You know, we didn't break the 3. Oh, that's terrible."" They said, ""Yes, sir, you did. They just took odd months."" I said, ""No, no, January to December."" 3.1 percent, first time in 14 years. Congratulations. Sort of incredible. It's true. This chart is a beauty. This is ""Venture Capital Deals Surged Following the Passage of"" -- really, the election -- rising nearly $17 billion."
00:24:15 - 00:24:49 (34 sec),"You know what that means. So here's your charts -- going along -- and here's us. See the red line there? It's like a rocket ship. Can you see that? It's small but cheap -- [Laughter] -- and it gets the point across, right? A couple of other things -- because I think this report is incredible. So these are ""Workers Coming Off the Sidelines,"" and now it's just -- this is just partially."
00:24:49 - 00:25:11 (22 sec),"So, the blue. The blue. The red. That's a big difference. That's a tremendous difference. The most in many, many years. And everyone said, ""You couldn't do it, couldn't bring back manufacturing jobs."" Remember? ""You'd need a magic wand."" We're bringing them back beyond anybody's expectations. You see the red line here?"
00:25:11 - 00:25:42 (30 sec),"These are ""Wages are Rising for the Workers."" These are ""Wages are Rising."" 3.4 percent -- it's one of the largest increases in 20 years. And for the most part, they were going down. They weren't even rising. I used to campaign -- I'd be in Ohio, I'd be in Pennsylvania, I'd be all over, and I'd talk about wages where people would have to work three jobs and they were making less than they did 20 years ago."
00:25:42 - 00:26:04 (22 sec),"You remember that, Rob? Jim? I used to do it all the time. I'd be -- it was just a part of my speech. I'd say, ""You're working three jobs. You make less money than you did 20 years ago."" And it was literally 21 years. And now wages are going up. And you have something else that's happening. If you don't like working here -- and you all do -- and I don't want to lose anybody."
00:26:04 - 00:26:23 (20 sec),"And who the hell would want to leave this place? This is what you call a great -- a great place to work. But if for any reason -- if for any reason you did, you can pick out six, seven, eight other jobs. In other words, you can finally have a job that you really like, where you like getting up in the morning."
00:26:23 - 00:26:47 (24 sec),"I do. I do, even though I have the fake news hounding me all the time. The fake and phony and corrupt. It's fake. It's corrupt. But we got to live with it, right? Got to live with it. But you guys -- you do; you get up in the morning, you love to come, and you love your job, or you wouldn't be doing what I just witnessed back there when I looked at some of these incredible tanks."
00:26:47 - 00:27:09 (21 sec),"And here's another chart: ""Deregulating and Saving"" -- through the roof. Here's a chart: ""The American Energy."" The United States is the largest producer -- that's happened over the last short period of time -- of crude oil and natural gas in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. We're also a net -- do you think Russia is happy about this?"
00:27:09 - 00:27:35 (26 sec),"I don't think so. You know, Hillary wanted to put windmills all over the place. Let's put up some windmills. ""When the wind doesn't blow, just turn off the television, darling, please."" [Laughter] ""No wind out today. There's no wind. Please turn off the television, quickly."" [Laughter] Put the windmills up and watch the value of your house -- if you're in sight of a windmill, watch the value of your house go down by 65 percent."
00:27:35 - 00:28:01 (26 sec),"Wonderful to have windmills. And solar is wonderful too, but it's not strong enough and it's very, very expensive. So the United States is now the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Happened all in that very short -- you know, you guys are all so -- think of that. Think of that, beating out Saudi Arabia and Russia."
00:28:01 - 00:28:25 (24 sec),"They're pretty good producers, right? Guess what? We do more than they do. And in a short period of time, as soon as we get some pipelines opened in Texas, we'll be able to almost double it. Double it. What we're doing is incredible. We approved the Keystone Pipeline. Right? I did that. Forty-eight thousand jobs between that and the Dakota Access Pipeline."
00:28:25 - 00:28:46 (21 sec),"I got them approved, like almost my first couple of days in office. I said, ""They're approved."" And what is it? It's good environmentally. It's underground. You're not riding it over tracks. You're not trucking it. It's actually a great thing, environmentally. But President Obama, after years and years and years, they said, ""We're not going to approve it."" I said, ""We'll approve it."" Forty-eight thousand jobs."
00:28:46 - 00:29:06 (20 sec),"Think of it. It's being built right now. They're both being built. One just got completed -- Dakota Access. And many, many other cases like that. Plants all over the country are going up. But the thing that's the greatest is companies that left us -- they no longer wanted to be in the USA -- they're coming roaring back."
00:29:06 - 00:29:30 (24 sec),"Toyota -- $13.5 billion. We've created more than almost 6 million jobs since the election. And if I would have said that to the fake news during the campaign, they would've said, ""He exaggerates."" I'm not exaggerating, but nobody would've believed that could happen. Including almost 600,000 manufacturing jobs."
00:29:30 - 00:29:58 (28 sec),"We could've taken your jobs, all. If it werenât for me, this place would've been closed. Would have been closed. Would have been closed, fellas. And you're doing us a favor because of the great job you do. It's not just a one-way street. You're doing us a favor. Last year, our manufacturers reported the highest level of optimism ever recorded in a 40-year-old poll."
00:29:58 - 00:30:36 (37 sec),"And this year we went up again. Went from 56 percent -- and it stayed there for years, between 50 and 56 -- to 94 percent. They've never had anything like it. Thatâs optimism. And we -- all of us -- are living by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. Very simple. Unemployment has recently reached the lowest rate in 51 years."
00:30:36 - 00:31:02 (27 sec),"Other than that, we're not doing well. [Laughter] More -- and think of this: More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million people. More than ever before, by far. And if you look at African American -- you've heard me say this many times -- African American employment is at an all-time low -- unemployment."
00:31:02 - 00:31:32 (30 sec),"Asian American unemployment is at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment -- an all-time low. Women's unemployment -- 65-year low. Soon it'll be historic, meaning better than ever. And soon the basic number will be historic. We've reduced the number of unemployed veterans by nearly 50 percent. I'm so proud of that."
00:31:32 - 00:32:01 (29 sec),"Thatâs why the veterans like me more than other people. That's why they like me. Fifty percent since the election. And veteran unemployment is now at the lowest level ever, ever, ever recorded. Thanks to our pro-American tax, regulatory, and trade policies -- and, by the way, we're doing great in our deal with China."
00:32:01 - 00:32:28 (26 sec),"They were taking out 500 billion a year for many years from our country. I consider that we've rebuilt China. Five hundred billion, not million. Think of what that means. Five-hundred billion dollars a year taken out of our country. And now they're paying us. They're paying tariffs on the products they're sending in, and we're negotiating and they want to make a deal."
00:32:28 - 00:32:50 (22 sec),"And hopefully, we'll make a deal. And if we don't, thatâs fine. And if we do, thatâs fine. It's got to be a good deal. It can't be a bad deal. We're so far down, it's got to be a great deal. If itâs not a great deal, we'll never catch up. And their economy is way down. And I donât want their economy to be down; I want their economy to be up. But their economy is down 32 to 38 percent."
00:32:50 - 00:33:11 (22 sec),"And our economy, if you look at the numbers, since my election, is up almost 50 percent. Fifty. Thatâs some difference. And the world economy -- the world economy is not good. And frankly, if the world economy were good, that would be, in a way, good for us. So we're fighting there. We're bucking."
00:33:11 - 00:33:36 (25 sec),"Europe is down, Asia is down -- a lot of places. Almost every place is down. Except the United States is up. And we're way up. And just think of what that would be. The world goes up; we go up with the world. The world is down, but we still go up. Something is happening. That wouldnât happen under Barack Obama, that I can tell you."
00:33:36 - 00:34:19 (43 sec),"It wouldnât happen under Crooked Hillary Clinton. [Laughter] Last week, as I said, Toyota announced a massive investment. They're going to be expanding factories all across our nation. And they're going to be soon building new ones. Ford is bringing hundreds of new jobs to Chicago and other places. Tremendous amount of car companies are coming into the great state of Michigan, and they're coming into the great state of Ohio."
00:34:19 - 00:35:10 (50 sec),"Volkswagen is creating 1,000 brand new jobs in the state of Tennessee. And Chrysler is building Detroitâs first new car factory in a generation -- so long ago -- in a generation. Think of that. Michigan. Michigan. You know, the nice part about running for President this time, as opposed to last time -- last time, you know, I said I was going to do it, but I didnât do it. But I said I was going to do it. This time, I've done it far greater than I said I was going to do it. So it's going to be really easy on the debate stage when they hit me with nonsense and I say, ""Really?"
00:35:10 - 00:35:45 (35 sec),"But African American unemployment -- the best it's ever been."" Hispanic, Asian, women, everybody -- itâs all the best itâs ever been. How do you top that in a debate? What are they going to say? ""Uh, well, it could be better""? [Laughter] No, the easy part -- and I say this to all of your political leaders here -- if you do a good job, it's a lot easier that second time."
00:35:45 - 00:35:57 (12 sec),"But nobody has done the job that we've done. And I say ""we"" because you've been on our side. Your union leaders aren't on my side, by the way. I watched them on television. They're not. But the unions -- the people that work there are on our side. It's true. It's true. I had -- [Audience chants Trump]"
00:35:57 - 00:36:18 (21 sec),"I had union leaders in the White House a few months ago -- the biggest guys. Nice guys, but they're Democrats no matter what. Okay? And you see where that's taken you. That would've been catastrophic. But I had them in, and we explained how good it was for the car industry, for this, for that. They said, ""Oh, thank you, sir."
00:36:18 - 00:36:46 (28 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this is unbelievable. Thank you, sir."" But then I see one of the guys the next day on a television show. The -- I think it was called ""Deface the Nation."" [Laughter] And -- ladies and gentlemen, ""Deface the Nation."" And he's saying how he's a Democrat and he wants Democrat policies -- which were, by the way, putting everybody in the poorhouse."
00:36:46 - 00:37:16 (30 sec),"But I just left the guy. He's hugging me, kissing me, telling him what an unbelievable deal. Nobody else could do it. And the next day, he's on there talking about stuff. And I really said, ""I sort of don't want to meet these guys. I want to deal with the people in the union, not the heads of the union."" Because the heads of the union are not honest people."
00:37:16 - 00:37:48 (31 sec),"They're not honest, and they ought to lower your dues, by the way. They ought to stop with the dues. They -- you're paying too much dues. As an example, they could've kept General Motors. They could've kept it in that gorgeous plant at Lordstown. They could've kept it. Lower your dues. Lower your dues."
00:37:48 - 00:38:17 (30 sec),"Americaâs Founders understood that to be strong and powerful as a nation, we must also be a great manufacturing nation. President Obama said, ""You'll never bring manufacturing back."" I said, ""What are you talking about?"" It's all about manufacturing. And we're bringing it back in record numbers. Nobody can believe it. And these are talented jobs."
00:38:17 - 00:39:00 (43 sec),"These are great jobs. These are genius jobs. And these are really well-paying jobs, as you people know. You get a lot of money. Letâs negotiate. [Laughter] We must not be dependent upon others for the resources we need to protect our people. When we open this plant, a couple of my people -- I have some good business people -- they said, ""Let's make a deal with the workers before we open it. We'll make a great deal."" I said, ""I agree we can do that, but we're not going to do that."
00:39:00 - 00:39:17 (17 sec),"These people have suffered enough."" We're going to open the plant and everybody is going to be happy. You understand what I mean by that. That's why my administration is restoring Americaâs defense industrial base by bringing great jobs and great wages to plants just like this in Lima. Economy and strength is security."
00:39:17 - 00:39:40 (23 sec),"And it's all about security and national security. It's about loving our country. It's about loving our flag. You know that. Now, as result of my very tough trade actions -- something I'm very proud of -- America's steel and our steel mills are roaring back to life. You know that. You see it all over."
00:39:40 - 00:40:10 (31 sec),"We put a big, fat beautiful tariff on that dumped steel. It's sand steel. It's mud steel. It's crap steel. And they're dumping it all over. I said, ""That's okay, you can dump but we're going to charge you 25 percent when you come in and think you're going to take our jobs and give us bad steel."" I know a lot about -- I've used a lot of steel."
00:40:10 - 00:40:34 (24 sec),"Right here in Ohio, Nucor has just announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a brand new, 150-million-dollar steel plant in Cuyahoga Heights. JSW Steel is restarting the furnace -- that's a massive furnace -- and investing $500 million in Mingo Junction."
00:40:34 - 00:41:03 (29 sec),"And Cleveland Cliffs announced a brand new, 700-million-dollar plant in Toledo, Ohio. Don't leave here, though. Donât leave here. Don't get any ideas. Don't get leave here. Just stay here. Just relax. Stay here. We don't want you going to Mingo Junction. We're also finally fixing the horrible trade deals that have cost our nation trillions of dollars and where we've lost millions and millions and millions of jobs, like we were stupid people."
00:41:03 - 00:41:28 (25 sec),"They closed a plant; they move it to Mexico. They make the product; they sell it right in the United States. No tax. All we end up with is loss and no jobs. We get no taxes. We get nothing. That doesn't happen anymore. Under our new deal, there's a tremendous financial disincentive to close up plants and move them to other countries."
00:41:28 - 00:41:43 (15 sec),"You're not going to see that anymore. And we're getting rid of the disaster known as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated in the history of the world. All over the country, you still see empty plants, when they haven't been converted to nursing homes and apartments, right?"
00:41:43 - 00:42:10 (27 sec),"It's not the same thing as a plant. I love apartments. I love the business. But that's not the same thing as a plant where you have 5,000 people working. Not the same thing. And replacing it -- we're replacing NAFTA with the great U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Like the song. If you can't remember -- YMCA, right?"
00:42:10 - 00:42:31 (20 sec),"We'll play the song for you, everybody. USMCA. We've taken historic action to confront Chinaâs trading abuses, because the days of stealing American jobs and our ideas and our wealth have come to an end, folks. They've come to an idea, all right? They've come to an end. We've made some progress."
00:42:31 - 00:42:57 (26 sec),"That's why you see these numbers. Look at that chart. Look at that. You don't have to know what's on it. What difference -- look at the line. [Laughter] You don't have to know what the hell is on it. All you know is thatâs a good line. [Laughter] Technological positive change. That's okay, right? It's all like that."
00:42:57 - 00:43:42 (45 sec),"That's what it is. Rob, Jim, that's what it is. Turner, see that? Look. That's what we fight for, right? Huh? That's what we're all fighting for. In everything we do and every action we take, we're putting America first, and we are putting American workers first, for the first time in a long time. So just in closing, I'd like to now introduce a couple of truly incredible workers from right here -- I guess you know these folks -- right here at the tank plant to share quickly their stories with you."
00:43:42 - 00:44:05 (23 sec),"Adam Stahler is a Quality Engineer who has worked at the plant for 10 years. His son, Derek, is a Specialist with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas. Great Place. Derek operates and maintains Stryker personnel carriers, one of the vehicles produced right here in Lima. Adam, thank you for everything your family has done for our nation."
00:44:05 - 00:44:07 (2 sec),"Please come up and say a few words. Adam, thank you."
00:44:07 - 00:44:55 (49 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. It's a pleasure and an honor to be up here today as a representative of the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center. For those of you who don't me, my name is Adam Stahler. I'm a Quality Systems Engineer employed here going on 10 years. Growing up in the area and currently living in Wapakoneta, I have witnessed the highs and lows the economy has had on this facility and the region."
00:44:55 - 00:45:10 (15 sec),"I'm proud that this administration recognizes the importance of this facility and the value we provide to the warfighter. It is very rewarding to have a son serving the United States military, where he is stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, working on a quality vehicle produced by my brothers and sisters at JSMC."
00:45:10 - 00:45:11 (1 sec),My son thanks you.
00:45:11 - 00:45:13 (1 sec),"And for that, I thank you."
00:45:13 - 00:45:23 (10 sec),"Boy, you're a young guy. How old are you?"
00:45:23 - 00:45:24 (1 sec),Forty-five.
00:45:24 - 00:45:27 (3 sec),Wow. You look like your son.
00:45:27 - 00:45:28 (1 sec),"Oh, thank you."
00:45:28 - 00:45:54 (26 sec),"Thank you. I thought Adam was the son. Look how young he looks. [Laughter] He's got a son working out there? Wow. Whatever you're eating, Adam, keep eating it. [Laughter] It's working. Jay Baldwin is a Boiler Operator and a proud Army veteran. After serving as a tank crewman on the M1, now Jay helps build the M1 right here."
00:45:54 - 00:45:57 (3 sec),"You know him. Jay, please come on up."
00:45:57 - 00:46:12 (16 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President, for coming to our plant in Lima, Ohio. As a former Army M1 tanker, I can honestly say that we make the best tank in the entire world. Our workers here are very proud to be making such a fine product for our soldiers to have the benefit and best capabilities on the battlefield."
00:46:12 - 00:46:37 (24 sec),"And thanks to our great President, his military and economic policies have rejuvenated this facility to increase production of armored vehicles and hiring of more skilled workers. And finally, it is my personal opinion that God was looking after our country when you were elected. Mr. President, thank you for everything you have done."
00:46:37 - 00:46:44 (8 sec),"Thank you, truthfully."
00:46:44 - 00:47:08 (24 sec),"Wow. Thank you. Thank you. That's so nice, Jay and Adam. I appreciate it. You never know what you get when you come up. It's live. [Laughter] But you couldnât do better than that, right? Thatâs great. Thank you, fellas. Thatâs great. I want to also thank all of the patriots here today. You remind us that the might of Americaâs armed forces also depends upon the skill and devotion of all of America's workers."
00:47:08 - 00:47:39 (31 sec),"And you really are doing a job. Weâre very proud of you. For nearly 80 years, the exceptional workers at this plant has embodied the strength of the American spirit. Those who choose to work here are drawn not just by the promise of a good paycheck but by the power of patriotism -- every single one of you is a patriot -- the chance to go to work every morning to help protect this nation that we so deeply love."
00:47:39 - 00:48:15 (36 sec),"Thatâs why veterans make up more than one third of the workforce at this wonderful plant. We very much stress: We want, wherever we can, we want veterans. Thatâs why you check -- right? Thatâs right. And thatâs why you check and recheck every bolt, every single thing having to do with that incredible tank -- every pin, every wire, every square inch of each tank before it leaves the floor."
00:48:15 - 00:48:39 (24 sec),"And I just got a little news that was given to me as I was walking up. U.S. forces, in the last month, have killed the terrorists responsible for the attack in Syria that killed four Americans, the Paris theater attack in 2015, and the USS Cole bombing in 2000. We killed them all. We killed them all."
00:48:39 - 00:49:33 (54 sec),"We killed them all. We killed them all. Theyâre bad people. But thatâs why you show up early and you stay late, and always get the job done right. Youâre proud of your work. You do it better than anyone, anywhere in the world -- what you do. No country on Earth can match you and no country can match what you do. In just a few months, we will commemorate the 75th anniversary of one of the many victories that workers at the Lima Army Tank Plant helped make possible: the Normandy landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944, in the Second World War."
00:49:33 - 00:49:47 (14 sec),It was right here on these very grounds that thousands of American workers modified M4 Sherman tanks in preparation for a battle that would forever change the course of human history.
00:49:47 - 00:50:18 (32 sec),Right here. The workers who rallied to the Lima plant came from all over northwest Ohio and beyond. They were farmers and refinery workers and shopkeepers and homemakers who rolled up their sleeves and got to work when their country needed them the most. Normandy. Many of them had full-time jobs elsewhere.
00:50:18 - 00:50:47 (29 sec),"They punched out at one job, then came here and punched right back in. Not for the money. They knew and fully understood the importance of what they did and what they represented. And if they were lucky, they might catch a few hoursâ sleep on the loading dock before doing it all again, day after day, day after day."
00:50:47 - 00:51:20 (32 sec),"In just three years, the patriots of Ohio cranked out more than 100,000 military vehicles -- a truly amazing feat that helped give America the power to vanquish tyranny, defeat our enemies, and save freedom for the entire world. This is the legacy that each of you inherits. And America knows you will carry it forward with the same purpose and passion that you've poured into this factory each and every day."
00:51:20 - 00:51:57 (37 sec),"We love you. We see your legacy in every battlefield victory, in the smiling faces of every soldier that returns home safely, and every time a citizen proudly salutes our great American flag. Because it is here in Lima -- right here -- that American greatness is forged with American hands, with American heart, and with American pride."
00:51:57 - 00:52:30 (32 sec),"True. True. We donât know what challenges will come, what dangers we must face, or what opportunities we must seize. But we know that America will always be ready because of you and your strength, and your skill and your drive, and your unbreakable spirit. Because of hardworking citizens like you, the people of Lima, the people of Ohio, and the people of America will always fight on to victory, victory, victory."
00:52:30 - 00:53:08 (38 sec),"You donât know how to lose. You never will have to find out. Youâll never have to find out about losing. Together, we shall forever be one nation, under God. So I want to thank you. I want to say God bless you, God bless Ohio, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody.Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:38 (38 sec),"Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you very much also to a man named Matt Schlapp. What a job he's done. And to CPAC -- I actually started quite a while ago at CPAC, and came here -- probably made my first real political speech. And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third."
00:00:38 - 00:01:16 (38 sec),"Then I said, what the hell, let's run for President. Right? But it's wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives. What a future you have. Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited. What we've done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world."
00:01:16 - 00:01:55 (40 sec),"They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities. They came from all over. And what we did in 2016 -- the Election, we call it, with a capital ""E"" -- it's never been done before. And we're going to do it, I think, again in 2020, and the numbers are going to be even bigger. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:01:55 - 00:02:20 (24 sec),"And we all had to endure, as I was running. So you had 17 Republicans, plus me. [Laughter] And I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican. People just didnât quite understand that. They didnât understand it. I think now, with what we've done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well."
00:02:20 - 00:02:48 (29 sec),"And it's driving the other side crazy. But we all had to endure, remember? How many times did you hear, for months and months, ""There is no way to 270""? You know what that means, right? ""There is no way to 270."" They couldnât get me there. We might as well have just given up. But there wasnât any way to 270. In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one."
00:02:48 - 00:03:36 (48 sec),"But we didnât need the one. We didnât need it. We won Maine. We won our half of Maine, remember? You have Nebraska. We won both in Nebraska. We won the half we had to win in Maine. So we got the one, but we didnât need the one, because we didnât get 270; we got 306 to 223. 223-306. A state called Wisconsin, a state called -- Michigan, where -- by the way, where Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion incredible -- expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce."
00:03:36 - 00:04:12 (36 sec),"Many, many car companies have moved back to Michigan and are continuing to do so. Big numbers. Nobody every thought they'd see that happen. So I think we're going to do even better in 2020. I think we're going to do numbers that people havenât seen for a long time. The men and women here today are on the frontlines of protecting Americaâs interests, defending Americaâs value, and reclaiming our nationâs priceless heritage."
00:04:12 - 00:05:07 (55 sec),"It's true. With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals. These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for. It's been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense. It wasnât ""America first."" In many cases, it was ""America last."" Those days are over."
00:05:07 - 00:05:43 (36 sec),"Long over. America is winning again. America is respected again. And the world knows it. When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents -- and I get along with them -- because they know that what's taken place over many years -- not just the Obama administration; long before that -- they can't believe, themselves, that they got away with it. They can't believe it. An impossible thing."
00:05:43 - 00:06:14 (31 sec),"And they like me. And the reason they like me -- they tell me; they say, ""Mr. President..."" I said -- as an example, President Xi of China, I have great respect. We have a great relationship. I say, ""How is it possible that you got away with this for so long?"" [Laughter] And he said, ""Because nobody ever asked us to change."" It's true."
00:06:14 - 00:06:43 (30 sec),"When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent and then to 40 percent -- and they said to me, ""We expected that somebody would call and say you can't do that."" [Laughter] ""Nobody called, so we just left it."" And I donât blame them."
00:06:43 - 00:07:16 (33 sec),We shouldâve been doing the same thing to them. But we didnât. True. Right? Hard to believe. It's hard to believe. But now things are different. Now we're negotiating with China. They wouldnât negotiate with previous administrations. But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich -- really rich.
00:07:16 - 00:08:07 (51 sec),"The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty. But, fortunately, they werenât terminated. We started getting politically correct, even back then. But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws? And I checked, and I found 301 and 382. I found one, 1938, where we can do what we have to do. But, you know, they had a debate in -- it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we didnât know what the hell to do with it. Tough, tough, tough."
00:08:07 - 00:08:29 (22 sec),"It was called the Great Tariff Debate. Mark Levin will look this up. [Laughter] And the problem is, with Mark, if I make a little mistake, he'll let us know on Sunday night. [Laughter] I got to be very careful when I talk about this. But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888. And the debate was: We didnât know what to do with all of the money we were making."
00:08:29 - 00:08:44 (16 sec),"We were so rich. And McKinley, prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country. And he made statements that, ""Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country. We can't do that. We can't ever allow that to happen."" And, you know -- I don't know, maybe you know."
00:08:44 - 00:08:45 (1 sec),"You know I'm totally off-script, right? [Audience member calls out]"
00:08:45 - 00:09:02 (16 sec),"Thank you, darling. [Laughter] You know I'm totally off script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off script. True. And if we donât go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks. Because we have to get it back. And when I look at what's happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, ""No, no..."" -- I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it -- [Audience Boos] [Audience Boos]"
00:09:02 - 00:09:43 (41 sec),"The Green New Deal, right? Green New Deal -- I encourage it. I think it's really something that they should promote. [Laughter] They should work hard on. It's something our country needs desperately. They have to go out and get it. But I'll take the other side of that argument only because I'm mandated to. I'm mandated."
00:09:43 - 00:09:59 (16 sec),"But they should stay with that argument. Never change. [Laughter] Never change. No planes. No energy. [Laughter] When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric. [Laughter] Let's hurry up. ""Darling"" -- ""Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling."" [Laughter] No, but it's true."
00:09:59 - 00:10:46 (47 sec),"So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 -- and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted. We built forces up that were incredible. Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay? They ended tariffs. Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs. They said, ""Oh, it's okay for other nations to come in."" I won't use a certain words because it's not politically -- but everybody knows the word I'd love to use."
00:10:46 - 00:11:13 (27 sec),"Should I use it? I won't do it. Our great First Lady always said, ""Don't use certain words, please."" I said, ""But the audience wanted me to do it."" She said, ""Don't do it."" And the problem is, if I do do that, they won't put the little preamble that we just went through. They'll just use the word, and they'll said, ""Isn't that terrible."" So I won't use it. [Laughter] I've learned."
00:11:13 - 00:11:14 (2 sec),Because with the fake news -- [Audience Boos]
00:11:14 - 00:11:59 (45 sec),"-- if you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, ""Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please."" ""Please get us the emails. Please!"" [Audience chants Trump]"
00:11:59 - 00:12:19 (19 sec),"So everybody is having a good time. I'm laughing, we're all having fun. And then that fake CNN and others say, ""He asked Russia to go get the emails. Horrible."" [Laughter] I mean, I thought -- like, two weeks ago, I'm watching and they're talking about one of the points. ""He asked Russia for the emails."" These people are sick."
00:12:19 - 00:12:49 (30 sec),"[Laughter] And I'm telling you, they know the game. They know the game, and they play it dirty -- dirtier than anybody has ever played the game. Dirtier than it's ever been played. But the thing that we've done is very special. Because, on trade, and because of tariffs -- and I know there are people in the Republican Party and people -- really, even conservatives -- good conservatives -- they donât like tariffs."
00:12:49 - 00:13:14 (26 sec),"I'm not liking or not liking. The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country. Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over? Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods. I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion."
00:13:14 - 00:13:59 (45 sec),"Not like $200 million -- that's a lot. This is 200 with a ""B"" -- billion. Two-hundred billion. So -- but I was nice, because we're having a very strong negotiation, which if it werenât for tariffs -- and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide. I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position."
00:13:59 - 00:14:22 (23 sec),"But in my case, it can't, because it's true. I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion. And here's the beauty: We've lost so much money with China -- $500 billion a year. And on trade, it's such a disaster; it's $507 billion a year. China -- just one country. We lose with everybody, almost."
00:14:22 - 00:14:54 (32 sec),"But China is one country. $507 billion, for many years. So the beauty is this: I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on. The numbers are staggering. Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury. And for those of you that havenât done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country -- as it's turned out, because it's now been on there for a long while."
00:14:54 - 00:15:24 (29 sec),"Our -- and I'm in no rush because I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it. Of the 25 points, we've paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points. Okay? Twenty-one. Thatâs what the numbers are. It's very simple. You know, everyone said, ""Oh, it's a tax on our..."" It's not really. And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it. So the tax really is incredible."
00:15:24 - 00:15:38 (14 sec),"But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate. But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not Mark Meadows. Where is the great Mark Meadows? He's here someplace. Man, has he been good. Mark and Jim Jordan, and -- I want to name every one of those couple of hundred people."
00:15:38 - 00:15:57 (19 sec),"Because we do have a lot. I want to name every damn one of them. They have been incredible. They've been fighting. And I just see Mark in the audience. They've been fighting -- with Deb, much more important. His wife is incredible. What an asset. He would be nowhere without her. [Laughter] Right?"
00:15:57 - 00:16:20 (22 sec),"But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it's dying. So they donât have anything with Russia. There's no collusion. So now they go and morph into, ""Let's inspect every deal he's ever done. We're going to go into his finances."
00:16:20 - 00:16:39 (19 sec),"We're going to check his deals. We're going to check..."" These people are sick. [Laughter] They're sick. I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday. No, it's the first time. He went into a meeting and he said, ""We're going to look into his finances."" I said, ""Where did that come from?"" He always talked about Russia -- collusion with Russia."
00:16:39 - 00:16:55 (17 sec),"The collusion delusion. [Laughter] So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out whether or not, and who we're dealing with. We're waiting for a report by people that werenât elected. We had -- think of this: We had the greatest election -- in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson."
00:16:55 - 00:17:25 (30 sec),"This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I'm not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater. You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan, when I first started. ""This is Ronald Reagan."" Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote."
00:17:25 - 00:17:50 (26 sec),"Those red hats -- and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. ""Make America Great Again,"" is what it says. Right? Right? But we had the greatest of all time. Now we have people that lost. And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there."
00:17:50 - 00:18:15 (24 sec),"And, all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit. Okay? [Laughter] With bullshit. Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the Attorney General says, ""I'm going to recuse myself."" [Laughter] ""I'm going to recuse."" And I said, why the hell didnât he tell me that before I put him in? How do you recuse yourself?"
00:18:15 - 00:18:49 (35 sec),"But the person that appointed Robert Mueller never received a vote. Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission. [Laughter] Now, how do you do that? These are angry, angry people. You take a look at them. One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen."
00:18:49 - 00:19:10 (21 sec),"[Laughter] All killers. In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put half and half, and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he'll probably do. But we have conflicts. I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why isnât that mentioned?"
00:19:10 - 00:19:27 (17 sec),"He wanted the job as FBI Director. I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it. Why isnât that -- and I didnât give it to him. Why isnât that mentioned? Jim Comey -- Lyin' James Comey -- [Audience Boos]"
00:19:27 - 00:20:11 (44 sec),"-- is his best friend. James Comey is his best friend. And those are a few of the conflicts. Other than that, it's wonderful. [Laughter] So -- so everybody is waiting. I thought of it this morning, Mark. And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement today. Mark Levin. I heard it was incredible."
00:20:11 - 00:20:38 (27 sec),"And I was on the way. But I'll see it later. I guarantee I'll be watching it later. I have one of the great inventions in history. It's called TiVo. [Laughter] I think it's actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right? [Laughter] But I'll be watching it later, Mark."
00:20:38 - 00:21:03 (25 sec),"But people that got no votes. But I heard this morning, ""President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report."" I said, wait a minute, let me get this straight. [Laughter] So the Attorney General recuses himself, and I donât fire him. No obstruction. That's the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it's called obstruction."
00:21:03 - 00:21:31 (28 sec),"But only for Trump. For nobody else. [Laughter] So the Attorney General is weak and ineffective, and he doesnât do what he should've done. Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter -- horrible -- about Comey. Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired, or worse, if possible. [Laughter] Every Republican said -- everybody -- in fact, when I fired Comey, I said, ""You know..."" -- First Lady -- I said, ""Melania, I'm doing something today."
00:21:31 - 00:21:59 (29 sec),"I'm doing it because it really has to be done."" He's bad. He's a bad, bad -- he's a bad, bad guy. That's been proven now with all of the emails and the texts. ""I'm doing something that has to be done. But you know the good news? It's going to be bipartisan. It's going to be so popular, it's going to be bipartisan."" [Laughter] Every Democrat hates him."
00:21:59 - 00:22:30 (30 sec),"Every Republican hates him. He did a horrible job at the FBI. Speak to the real agents, the real people. Because the people in the FBI are incredible people -- not the sleaze on top. And I said to the First Lady -- I said, ""But you know the good news? The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan."
00:22:30 - 00:22:56 (27 sec),"Everyone is going to love it."" So we fire Comey. And Schumer -- who called for his resignation many times -- Podesta, I believe that day -- because he still hasnât gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay? I believe that day called for his resignation. That day. Podesta, the great genius of campaigns."
00:22:56 - 00:23:27 (31 sec),"[Laughter] He called for the Comey resignation. Others -- almost every, I would say. Mark, would you say virtually every Democrat, virtually every -- I can't think of anybody that said he's doing a good job. So I said to Melania, ""Melania, the good news, this will be a popular thing."" [Laughter] And I fire a bad cop."
00:23:27 - 00:23:54 (27 sec),"I fire a dirty cop. And all of a sudden, the Democrats say, ""How dare he fire him. How dare he do this."" And that's where we are, folks. That's where we are. We're in this swamp of Washington, D.C. But you know what? We're winning, and they're not. We're winning. So, just to finish -- and I'll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this."
00:23:54 - 00:24:18 (23 sec),"[Laughter] He's saying, ""This is a lot more than we paid for."" You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, ""Bye, folks."" But you know what I like about this? Number one, I'm in love, and you're in love. We're all in love together. We've done something that nobody has ever done. Right?"
00:24:18 - 00:24:40 (22 sec),"It's easy. No, it's easy. You know, a great friend of mine from New York, he's a stone-cold killer. He's a brutal man. He's actually not even a good friend of mine because he'd turn on me in two seconds if it was [Inaudible]. [Laughter] But he's a very rich guy. And he said, ""What are you going to speak about today?"
00:24:40 - 00:25:08 (27 sec),"Like, what are you going to speak?"" I said, ""I don't know. I don't know."" [Laughter] He said, ""I just heard that you have the biggest crowd in the history of CPAC. They're all over. By the way, not only in this giant room. They're in many hotel rooms all over the place. You're just better at real estate than they are."" [Laughter] True."
00:25:08 - 00:25:54 (46 sec),"But this guy -- you all know his name -- very rich guy. And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking. If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes. [Laughter] He can't breathe. You know, juh-juh. ""Are you okay?"" He kills people for a living -- meaning mentally and financially -- but if there's like an audience of nine, it's like ""augh."" [Laughter] So he said to me, ""How the hell do you do that?"" And I said, ""It's easy."" And the reason it's easy -- I really mean this -- there's so much love in this room, it's easy to talk."
00:25:54 - 00:26:28 (34 sec),You can talk your heart out. You really could. There's love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. And we've had that from the day I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in Trump Tower. It's been easy. And you know what? We never had an empty seat.
00:26:28 - 00:26:59 (31 sec),"We went out and helped Ted Cruz. We went out and helped so many people. And I'll tell you what: If we didnât do those 32 rallies -- and it wasnât easy. When you're doing rallies with 25-, 30,000 people -- in Texas, we had 109,000 people sign up. We used the Houston Rockets arena; it holds 22,000. Tens of thousands were outside."
00:26:59 - 00:27:34 (35 sec),"We were sending notices, ""Please donât come."" That's a little different. Usually, people are begging. ""Well, yeah, like can somebody come?"" [Laughter] We never had an empty seat. Of course, the Washington Post -- a guy named David Weigel -- he wrote an article, some arena -- [Audience Boos]"
00:27:34 - 00:28:30 (56 sec),"No, listen to this. He wrote an article. He got there four hours early. He took pictures of an empty arena. He then put out a note -- something to the effect, ""Not very good crowd size, Mr. President."" And I never saw it because I donât follow the guy. But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that couldnât get in -- he got there four or five hours early because he doesnât fly private."
00:28:30 - 00:28:49 (19 sec),"You know. [Laughter] And maybe it's because of the carbon footprint. You think maybe that's it? [Laughter] Maybe. Must be the carbon footprint. He just doesnât want private. But he got there hours early. And, you know, the place hadnât started taking in people. They werenât going to take them in. So there were virtually nobody."
00:28:49 - 00:29:11 (22 sec),"And, you know, whatever it was -- 18,000 -- when you have nobody, it's a little scary-looking. So he took pictures. And you know who really got even? Our people. Because they were incensed. We had people sitting on the stairwells. We had people sitting in every seat. I donât think we've had an empty seat since we announced."
00:29:11 - 00:29:31 (19 sec),"And from the day we came down the escalator, I really donât believe we've had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium. It's been an incredible thing. And that's why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in 2020 with an even bigger victory. [Applause, Audience chants Four More Years]"
00:29:31 - 00:29:53 (22 sec),"And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great Sarah Huckabee and Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here -- Mercedes, thank you. They always say -- you know, they're good people, right? Much better than I am. They always say, ""Don't bring it up. Donât fight. Donât fight."
00:29:53 - 00:30:22 (29 sec),"Everyone understands."" I said, ""They donât understand."" If I donât explain it, how are they going to understand? So remember the arena one, right? And then it was shown. And the Washington Post had to do -- and this particular writer -- had to do a -- I thought he was going to get fired. I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot."
00:30:22 - 00:31:09 (47 sec),"He would've been humiliated for what he did. Because it was fake news. Nobody was in the arena. There were thousands outside but they hadnât opened the gates yet. They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean -- how horrible."
00:31:09 - 00:31:30 (21 sec),And I watched it by mistake. [Laughter] And they showed -- they showed from the White House all the way down. They showed from the Cap- -- they showed -- there were people. Nobody has ever seen it. The Capitol down to the Washington Monument -- people. But I saw pictures that there were no people. [Laughter] Those pictures were taken hours before.
00:31:30 - 00:32:02 (32 sec),"Right? And they always mention crowd size. ""He talks about crowd size."" So I'm constantly bugging Mercedes. Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, ""Mercedes"" -- and Sarah -- ""show them the pictures. Show them. And compare them with what they put on television. Those pictures were taken hours before."" And remember this also -- not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument."
00:32:02 - 00:32:27 (25 sec),"And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet. And women and men -- and I consider them totally equal, so I'm not going to say it's harder. [Laughter] In fact, it's probably, with the men I know, it's actually easier for the women to make the walk, right? [Audience Calls Out No]"
00:32:27 - 00:32:52 (25 sec),"But they had to walk all the way down. They had to walk with high heels, in many cases. They had to walk all the way down to the Washington Monument and then back. And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on -- I said to the people that were sitting next to me, ""I've never seen anything like this."
00:32:52 - 00:33:18 (26 sec),"Look at that crowd."" And it was wide. Wide. We had a crowd -- I've never seen anything like it. And I have to live -- I have to live with ""crowd size."" It's all a phony deal. But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken hours before our great day. That was a great day for us. That was a great, great day."
00:33:18 - 00:33:48 (30 sec),"People came from all over. People came from all over. So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, ""Sir, it doesnât matter. Nobody cares."" I said, ""But I care."" [Laughter] And people care. People care. So what I'm going to do is I'll give it to the great one. I'll give it to Mark Levin. And I'll give him the picture."
00:33:48 - 00:34:21 (34 sec),"Then I'll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field -- like nobody on it. And you'll see the sun. You know, you can see it's very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right? [Laughter] And you can have some fun. You're going to get big ratings on your show, I'll tell you that."
00:34:21 - 00:34:56 (34 sec),"Sunday night, everybody. Sunday night. Huh? Ten o'clock, right? Sunday night at 10 o'clock. [Audience Member Calls Out, Trump laughs] Thank you. I knew that, actually. But thank you. All right, now let's get back to what I'm here for. [Laughter] And don't fall asleep. Donât fall asleep, right? Donât fall asleep. You know, somebody said, ""Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible."" They said it was incredible."
00:34:56 - 00:35:30 (35 sec),"They said that was so great. And I said -- I said -- I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there. [Laughter] Of course, by the following morning, they had to change because the head people called up, ""What are you doing?"" [Laughter] A lot of it is not the people on television, you know."
00:35:30 - 00:35:51 (20 sec),"A lot of it is their bosses -- which someday we're going to have to figure out why, Meadows, why that is. Because, you know, if you're building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we've ever had. More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country."
00:35:51 - 00:36:19 (28 sec),"And you say, why are they upset by that? Why? Why are they upset by that? We've slashed 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record in the history of the United States, even by Presidents there for eight years, and in one case more. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history."
00:36:19 - 00:36:46 (28 sec),"And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal. Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare. It should. The great state of Texas has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate. Now that it's gone, I don't know how they rule against it. Now we'll have to find out."
00:36:46 - 00:37:14 (27 sec),"But that'll soon be up in the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope. And we're going to see what happens. And then we're going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay? Really great healthcare. And of the other things we did in our tax package is ANWR. Perhaps the largest field in the world -- oil and gas."
00:37:14 - 00:37:40 (26 sec),"I got it approved. And I didnât want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Donât get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I donât want to get it. Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he's in the oil business."
00:37:40 - 00:38:16 (36 sec),"He's not asking for anything. He said -- but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas. He said to me, ""Hey"" -- and they all call me ""Mr. President."" I have friends that, for 35 years, ""Hey, Don, how you doing? Hey, Donny. I love you, Donny."" For 35 years. Now they call, ""Mr. President, sir."" [Laughter] ""How are you?"" I have a friend -- a very rich guy -- Richard LeFrak, in New York."
00:38:16 - 00:38:45 (29 sec),"A builder. A good builder. He calls me all my life, ""Hey, Don, how you doing?"" I've known this guy so long -- from kindergarten. [Laughter] It's true. ""Hi, Don, how you doing? How's everything?"" And now I get a call the other day, ""Mr. President, how are you, sir? How are you?"" I said, ""Richard, lighten up. Lighten up."" [Laughter] ""Call me 'Donald'."" ""Richard, call me 'Donald'."" You've known me for -- I donât want to say, because I donât want my wife to hear the number."" [Laughter] But -- it's true."
00:38:45 - 00:39:18 (32 sec),"Actually, that's true. That's actually true. Richard came up; he said, ""I've known your husband for 65 years."" I said, ""Donât say that."" [Laughter] I say, ""Say 25, 30. Donât say 65 years."" But I said, ""Richard -- Richard, call me 'Donald', like you always do. Call me 'Don'."" ""Okay."" ""Okay, Don. Okay."" He gets his breath."
00:39:18 - 00:40:04 (46 sec),"Uh-huh. Two minutes later -- ""Mr. President..."" [Laughter] That's called respect for the office, right? Maybe that's a good thing, right? Many -- many of my friends. And that wasnât in the script either, Mark. [Laughter] But we're renegotiating, right now, horrible trade deals that we're cracking down -- and we are really doing a number -- cracking down on countries that cheat, and standing up for the American worker for the first time in many, many decades."
00:40:04 - 00:40:29 (25 sec),Many decades. Our workers have been treated horribly. A country announces they're closing their plant in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Ohio -- they're closing. They're closing a plant; they're going to move to Mexico. They're going to move to China. They're going to move someplace else. They fire all their workers.
00:40:29 - 00:40:58 (29 sec),"And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in Mexico, sell them back to here. No tax, no nothing. Those days are all gone, folks. They're all gone. They're all gone. And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it's very, very hard -- prohibitively hard -- for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location."
00:40:58 - 00:41:19 (21 sec),"It's now a very costly -- they can do it, I guess, if they want. But it's costly. It's painful. It used to be almost -- I said -- I used to -- I've been talking about this for a long time. I used to say it's almost like we're giving them an incentive to leave our country. Again, I'm for America first. That wasnât for America first."
00:41:19 - 00:41:35 (16 sec),"And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country. They're coming back in. They're coming back in. And, by the way, you know I'm building the wall. We're finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It's in the thing. [Audience chants Build that Wall]"
00:41:35 - 00:42:25 (50 sec),But -- and there will be some people in the room that donât like this. We're down to 3.7 percent unemployment -- the lowest number in a long time. But think of this: I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place.
00:42:25 - 00:42:40 (15 sec),"This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we've been. Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in. We need workers to come in, but they've got to come in legally, and they've got to come in through merit, merit, merit. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:42:40 - 00:43:09 (29 sec),"They've got to come in through merit. They have to be people that can help us. They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country. We have people in Congress -- right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country. [Audience Boos]"
00:43:09 - 00:43:33 (24 sec),"And you know that. And we can name every one of them if they want. They hate our country. It's sad. It's very sad. When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it's very, very sad. Very, very -- and find out, how did they do in their country? Just ask them, how did they do? Did they do well?"
00:43:33 - 00:44:09 (36 sec),"Were they succeeding? Just ask that question. Somebody would say, ""Oh, that's terrible that he brings that up."" But that's okay, I donât mind. I'll bring it up. [Laughter] How did they do in their country? Not so good. Not so good. But we need workers. We have to bring in workers. One other thing -- because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes."
00:44:09 - 00:44:32 (23 sec),"We have some senators. We have some congressmen. When a senator tells us that he's a free trader, so am I. I'm a fair trader. I'm a free trader. But when a senator said we can't do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we're able to use this tremendous power that I found -- tremendous -- old stuff."
00:44:32 - 00:45:00 (28 sec),"Nobody even knew it existed. I'm able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals. They wouldn't even be talking to us because it's so one-sided. Last year, we lost eight hundred -- this for many years -- almost $800 billion on trade. It's not sustainable. You can't do that. And now we're making great trade deals."
00:45:00 - 00:45:28 (28 sec),"But when some of the senators -- good people; I think they're good people. I just don't understand the thinking. So I say, India is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot. When we send a motorcycle to India, it's 100 percent tariff. They charge 100 percent. When India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing."
00:45:28 - 00:45:53 (24 sec),"So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax. It's called a mirror tax, but it's a reciprocal tax. Now, here's what I don't understand: I've had a lot of people -- Lindsey Graham. I said, Lindsey -- it's not his thing necessarily. It's not the thing that he's most adept at. But he's adept and he's smart."
00:45:53 - 00:46:14 (21 sec),"I said, ""Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci-..."" If they charge us, we charge them. He goes, ""That makes sense to me."" [Laughter] And then he gets on to judiciary and things that, frankly, he likes and finds very interesting. But he's a smart guy, and he said -- I'll never forget. It took me about a minute, which is a long time."
00:46:14 - 00:46:34 (21 sec),"I did a bad description. It's so easy. They charge 100; we charge nothing. Now we have reciprocal, so it's 100. But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and don't like tariffs for whatever reason might be -- and that's okay. What's going to happen is, in many cases, instead of 100 and 100, you're going to have zero and zero, so you won't have any tariff."
00:46:34 - 00:46:56 (21 sec),"Okay? It's going to happen. That's going to happen. But you have to -- you have to start working on some of the senators that say ""I can't approve this deal."" I say, ""You know what? I want to just charge India"" -- as an example, I'm using it. But India is a very high-tariff nation. I mean, nobody -- nobody knows it because nobody knows what they're doing in Washington."
00:46:56 - 00:47:20 (24 sec),"[Laughter] But India is a very, very high-tariff nation, and they charge tremendous -- tremendous numbers. So they charge 100. So I say, ""I'm not going to charge 100, but I'm going to charge 25 percent."" And I hear this turmoil in the Senate because we're charging 25. So I call a couple of the guys up. I say, ""Fellas, listen, they're charging us 100 for the exact same product."
00:47:20 - 00:47:45 (25 sec),"I want to charge them 25."" And I feel so foolish charging 25 because it should be 100. ""But I'm doing 25 only because of you. I want to get your support."" ""Sir, that's not free trade."" Where do these people come from? [Laughter] Where do they come from? Where? Where do they come from? I need your help. I need your help -- the voters' help."
00:47:45 - 00:48:17 (32 sec),"Where do they come from? So it can only be one of two or three things. Number one, I know they're very smart people. I know they are. And I even like some of them. [Laughter] But they're smart. So we take that out of the equation. So even -- and I know they don't have evil intentions. And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe -- you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous."
00:48:17 - 00:48:49 (32 sec),"Campaign contributions -- they're very, very generous people. Can that be possible? I don't think so. I hope not. Because we're talking about our country. We can't allow a country to charge 100 percent and we get nothing for the same exact product. For one thing, they don't respect us. They think we're ""stupido."" They don't respect us. [Laughter] But let me tell you something: The world respects our country again."
00:48:49 - 00:49:39 (50 sec),"They respect us. And America is now booming like never before. Other countries are doing very poorly. Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful. Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the Fed. We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed. We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the Fed. So with all of those things -- and we want a strong dollar, but let's be reasonable."
00:49:39 - 00:50:00 (21 sec),"You understand that. With all of that, we're doing great. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? There's no inflation, essentially. There's no inflation. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? If we didn't do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market?"
00:50:00 - 00:50:38 (38 sec),"If we didn't do quantitative -- and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar. A little bit. I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's going to be great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business. Since the election, we've created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy."
00:50:38 - 00:51:20 (42 sec),"5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country. These are jobs that were never coming back to our country. Remember? Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked Hillary winning the election, instead of being up almost 50 percent with the stock market, you would have been down 50 percent."
00:51:20 - 00:52:00 (40 sec),"It was heading down. It was going to be a disaster. We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps. Nobody ever thought that was possible. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years. And African American -- and you've heard me say this many times -- Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows."
00:52:00 - 00:52:41 (41 sec),"And African American income has reached an all-time high. So when I'm on the debate stage with one of these maniacs -- [Laughter] -- I mean, trains to Hawaii. ""How do you get to Europe?"" ""We haven't figured that one out yet. We don't use airplanes anymore."" [Laughter] You saw what I'm doing in California, right?"
00:52:41 - 00:53:03 (22 sec),"They have a fast train. The fast train goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It's over budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, so they have a great idea -- the new governor; nice guy. Yeah, he's a nice guy. When I'm with him face to face, nice. When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me. [Laughter] He called me up. He said, ""You're a great President."
00:53:03 - 00:53:30 (27 sec),"You're doing a great job."" He actually did, two weeks ago, three weeks. So he'll probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House. Everybody else does. [Laughter] Check them. Check them. Check them. Called me up three or four weeks ago. I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that's one of the problems they have."
00:53:30 - 00:53:47 (17 sec),"I said, ""You got to get those forests."" We can't keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly. Got to clean it up. It's called management. When a tree falls, you can't let the environmentalist say you can't take that tree out. It becomes like a matchstick, that tree."
00:53:47 - 00:54:16 (29 sec),"It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves -- every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so -- a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it. The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed. You got to have management. But he called me up the other day, recently -- let's say four weeks ago or so. He said, ""I just want to tell you you're a great President and you're one of the smartest people I've ever met."" That's what he said."
00:54:16 - 00:54:35 (19 sec),"Now, that's what he said. Will he admit it? No, I doubt it. [Laughter] But that's what he said. ""And you're doing a great job."" And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is -- [Laughter] -- it's okay. That's okay. We have great talks. I mean, I like him. Gavin Newsom."
00:54:35 - 00:55:02 (27 sec),"I like him. Nice guy. But they say things -- you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see two days later they're giving a news conference -- just like, where did that guy come from? Where did he come from? But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well -- except, of course, for the Never Trumpers."
00:55:02 - 00:55:43 (41 sec),"But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. [Laughter] Mouth to mouth. Mouth to mouth. They're hanging in. A couple of them. I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong. Not only Never Trumpers. You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline. They're basically dishonest people -- because, look, let's face it: Whether you like me or not -- if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges -- it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges."
00:55:43 - 00:56:19 (36 sec),"And 17 appellate division judges. That we've got the best economy maybe in our history. That we've got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history. That we've cut more regulations in two years than any President has ever done, whether it's for eight or beyond. That we've taken care of our military with -- $1.7 billion."
00:56:19 - 00:56:39 (20 sec),"Think of that. Think of what we did. Think of what we did with our military. Think of the numbers that we have for our military. We have numbers -- nobody has ever heard of these numbers before. And you know, part of the problem that we have -- because I'm a cost cutter. But -- and you are all cost cutters."
00:56:39 - 00:57:07 (28 sec),"But we have to take care of our military. We have to. Seven hundred billions dollars we spent. And that was the first year. And then the second year, $716 billion. Now, I have no choice. I'd like to spend much less. Obama was spending much less but our military was being depleted. He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end."
00:57:07 - 00:57:33 (26 sec),"And, by the way, as of probably today or tomorrow, we will actually have 100 percent of the caliphate in Syria. One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And we'll leave a small group of guys and gals. But we want to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. It's time."
00:57:33 - 00:58:24 (51 sec),"Been in these wars. We were going to be in Syria for four months. We ended up five years. This fighting -- they just like to fight. We want to fix our country. We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools. We want to fix our country up. It's time. It's time. But I was told by a general, who I had to fire -- I said, ""General, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate?"" He said, ""Sir, two years."" I said, ""I can't take it two years."" And then I flew to Iraq; first time I left the White House -- because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places."
00:58:24 - 00:58:40 (16 sec),"[Laughter] And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay? I figured it would look good. [Laughter] I figured it would look good. So I stayed in the White House. And I'll tell you what: I was there -- I told my wife, ""Go to Florida."
00:58:40 - 00:59:01 (21 sec),"Enjoy your Christmas."" I stayed for Thanksgiving. I said -- I mean, I was in the White House for a long time. Months. Months. I had cabin fever in the White House. [Laughter] But if you've got to have cabin fever, that's the place to do it, okay? [Laughter] But I was there, I don't know, for a number of months, through Christmas."
00:59:01 - 00:59:05 (4 sec),"I spent my New Year's all by myself. [Laughter, Audience calls out Awww]"
00:59:05 - 00:59:35 (29 sec),"Don't cry. All -- it was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns. [Laughter] I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns. I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, ""Man..."" They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn. I told people, ""I'm in this mess"" -- you know, people don't know how big the White House."
00:59:35 - 00:59:54 (20 sec),"First of all, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world. It's really -- I made a lot of money with luxury. This building is -- 1799 -- which, of course, when President Xi comes, I say ""1799,"" like it's old. To him, that's like a brand-new house in China. [Laughter] In China, they go back -- they go back 8,000 years."
00:59:54 - 01:00:29 (35 sec),"So that's -- that's like a new -- that's like a new residence. But I sat in the White House for months and months, except I took a day off. I flew to a lovely place called Iraq, and I flew at night and I got there at night. And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, ""Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off."" I say, ""Why?"" [Laughter] ""Because we're getting ready to land."" We're an hour out."
01:00:29 - 01:00:46 (18 sec),"I said, ""What about the shades?"" ""Well, we want it better than that. May be like [Inaudible]. So we turned the lights off, put the shades down. This is a big seven forty -- Air Force One. And we're landing, and I go up and I look. And I've landed; I like to sit with pilots. I respect people that know what they're doing, and these are the best in the world."
01:00:46 - 01:01:11 (25 sec),"I really do. These are the best in the world. And the pilot says, ""Sir, we're landing in approximately one and a half minutes."" I say, ""But there's no runway."" ""No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir."" I say, ""I don't see it."" I have pretty good vision. [Laughter] At least for my age I have good vision."
01:01:11 - 01:01:30 (19 sec),"[Laughter] I guess for my age I have great vision. But I donât have vision like a 35-year-old captain. He said, ""No, it's right up there."" I said, ""I'm sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again? Captain, there's no runway."" Anyway -- he sits right up there and we land. There's practically not lights."
01:01:30 - 01:02:00 (29 sec),"These are little pin spots. And I said, think of this: We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we can't land with the lights on -- [Laughter] -- 20 years later. How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights. But I met some incredible people."
01:02:00 - 01:02:24 (24 sec),I met some incredible people -- generals. One of them came from Syria -- the operation in Syria. And I was upset with my generals because they weren't getting it finished. I want the job done. I want to bring our people back home. It's not fair. And this is why I flew. So I met generals I didn't know.
01:02:24 - 01:02:48 (24 sec),"General one, general two, general three. I mean, these generals -- there's no person in Hollywood that could play the role. These guys are like perfect people. I said, ""What's your name? ""Sir, my name is Raisin."" What the hell kind of a name? [Laughter] I said, ""Raisin, like the fruit?"" He goes, ""Yes, sir, Raisin."" ""What's your last name?"" ""Caine."
01:02:48 - 01:03:12 (24 sec),"Raisin Caine."" [Laughter] I said, ""You got to be kidding me."" It's true. Raisin Caine. I just made him a big star. [Laughter] Just like I did with Mattis when I said, ""We're going to give you a new nickname, because 'Chaos' is not a good nickname."" So we changed his name. Called him ""Mad Dog."" But it wasnât working too well."
01:03:12 - 01:03:28 (16 sec),"Mad Dog wasn't working too well. So what happened is I flew to Iraq. I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what's going on, than I do from generals. I do. I hate to say it. And I tell that to the generals all the time. But I didn't have to go there."
01:03:28 - 01:03:47 (19 sec),"I didn't have to go there. Because I meet -- and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing. We must have spent $3 billion building it. It's one of the reasons I don't want to leave Iraq so fast. I said, ""Well, how do we leave this thing?"" So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants."
01:03:47 - 01:04:10 (23 sec),"And I said, ""Bring the cameras. I'm going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing."" [Laughter] And I said to the generals, ""Listen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left."" ""It won't, sir."" And I said, ""Tell me why it won't."" ""It won't, sir."
01:04:10 - 01:04:49 (39 sec),"If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster."" ""Okay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can"" -- ""Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week."" I said, ""One week? I was told two years."" [Laughter] One week? ""That's right, sir. We're only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over -- from the base that you're right on, right now, sir."
01:04:49 - 01:05:08 (19 sec),"They won't know what the hell hit them."" ""They won't know what the hell hit them, sir."" And I said, ""Why didn't my other generals tell me that? Why didn't they tell me that?"" I said, ""Did you tell them that?"" ""Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders."
01:05:08 - 01:05:36 (28 sec),"You're the first one to ask us our opinion."" It's true. It's true. True. True. So I went back and I said, ""I'm going to get back to you soon, Raisin. I think you're great."" [Laughter] ""I like you, Raisin Caine."" But I did say -- I said, ""Well, hey, listen, we're in Iraq. Isn't that very far away from..."" ""I was here in a very short time, sir."
01:05:36 - 01:06:00 (24 sec),"I flew right in."" Of course, he's taking a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, you know. But incredible. What you learn from being on the site -- my father was a builder. He always used to say, ""Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk."" It's true. It's true. He'd say, ""You got to be on this site."
01:06:00 - 01:06:18 (18 sec),"You got to be with the contractors. You got to see if they're ripping you off. You've got to collect every nail that's dropped, every piece of wood. You can sell it. You got to be on the site. You got to see while they're building, while they're under construction, is that wall straight or if it's crooked."
01:06:18 - 01:06:40 (22 sec),"And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down."" True. You donât get rich by sitting behind a desk. So I didn't want to do that. And I'm in the White House and I was lonely. I said, ""Let's go to Iraq."" [Laughter] And I had a hell of a meeting in Iraq."
01:06:40 - 01:07:09 (29 sec),"And I'll tell you, those generals -- not just Raisin Caine, General Caine. Those generals were great. They were great. They knew their stuff. They were gung-ho. And it is true -- I mean, you talk central casting. These guys -- you couldnât -- I mean, it's incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he's the star of the movie."
01:07:09 - 01:07:38 (29 sec),"That happened once before, you know. That did happen once before. Remember? They brought a man in -- a sergeant, a drill sergeant -- to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant. The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn't. That's because Hollywood discriminates against our people."
01:07:38 - 01:08:12 (34 sec),"You know the movie I'm talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie. But while we're making great strides, and our country is doing as well -- and maybe, in many ways, better than it's ever done before -- Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism. They want to replace individual rights with total government domination. [Audience Boos]"
01:08:12 - 01:08:35 (23 sec),"Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American healthcare. Their radical government-run plan -- if you call it that -- would lead to colossal tax increases -- increases like you've never seen before -- and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans. [Audience calls out No]"
01:08:35 - 01:09:16 (41 sec),"And we have some great private coverage, and we've initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost. But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal. [Audience Boos]"
01:09:16 - 01:09:55 (39 sec),"Under the Green New Deal -- which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student -- [Laughter] -- it's true. It's true. Who would believe it? It so -- it's so bad. But I don't -- I'll be honest with you, folks. I said -- you know, it's Saturday morning, and I said, ""Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time?"" He said, ""Yeah, would you do that?"" By the way, everybody okay?"
01:09:55 - 01:10:20 (25 sec),"I haven't seen anybody leaving. I haven't seen anybody. I know one thing: If Mark Levin gets up and leaves, I'll finish very quickly, because then I know. [Laughter] But I haven't seen anyone leaving. Nobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times -- a lot of times -- well, one time, the press said people left."
01:10:20 - 01:10:46 (27 sec),"Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back. [Laughter] Two people. They showed two empty seats in a stadium of 19,000. They showed two empty seats. The people left right in front of me, and I said, ""Oh, man, maybe this isn't a good job I'm doing."" Then they came back."
01:10:46 - 01:11:15 (28 sec),"They went to the bathroom. [Laughter] And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats. The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we're now the leader in the world."
01:11:15 - 01:11:40 (26 sec),"We're the biggest now in the world because of moves that I've made. Happened over the last two years, by the way. And we're trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years. We think we're almost very close to getting them approved. When that happens, we'll go probably another 30 to 40 percent."
01:11:40 - 01:12:13 (33 sec),"We need pipeline approval. We're going to have it very quickly. It would have taken -- it was going to be a 14- to 15-year process. We should have it done. We'll pick up 30 to 40 percent more. Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads. Oh, that's not so bad. They want you to have one car instead of two, and it should be electric, okay?"
01:12:13 - 01:12:35 (22 sec),"So tell people, no more cars. No more cars. I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan. What do you think, Meadows? How is this? Will the auto industry be good? I donât think so. It's not looking good. I think maybe -- maybe you're going to see some bad stock prices if that passes."
01:12:35 - 01:13:01 (26 sec),"It would end air travel. But you'll get on a train, don't worry about it. You just have to cross off about 95 percent of the world. And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States. New York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again."
01:13:01 - 01:13:27 (26 sec),"I don't think so. This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for 20 years -- white hair. See, I don't have white hair. [Laughter] I donât have white hair. No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she's ranting and raving like a lunatic. [Laughter]"
01:13:27 - 01:14:01 (35 sec),"And these senators -- these senators: ""Yes, I agree with this. Yes, I agree."" The crazy female senator from the state of Ohio, the state of Hawaii. Right? She's like -- she's like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad. But she's standing in the hallway."
01:14:01 - 01:14:39 (38 sec),"And she didn't know too much about the plan because she's -- you know, she can't understand that plan. [Laughter] Which probably makes her smart, actually. Now, this is the senator from Hawaii, and they're saying to her, ""What do you think? Well, I don't know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I'm in favor of the plan."" [Laughter] I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. So she's in favor of the plan, but you won't be able to get to -- well, we can take boats, I guess."
01:14:39 - 01:15:10 (30 sec),We'll go back to boats. This is the new Democrat platform for the -- and I don't want to talk them out of it. I don't. I don't. I swear I don't. This is a killer. I got to get off this subject. I want them to embrace this plan. I want them to go and sell this plan. I just want to be the Republican that runs against them for that.
01:15:10 - 01:15:40 (30 sec),"I'm going to regret this speech. This speech should have been delivered one year from now, not now, damn it. [Laughter] Because they're going to grab out together, and they're going to say, ""You know, this guy is really laying for us."" I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year. [Laughter] Because I've destroyed her political career, and now I won't get a chance to run against her, and I wouldâve loved it. [Laughter] We got to -- you know, I don't want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that's actually got talent."
01:15:40 - 01:15:58 (19 sec),That would be terrible. [Laughter] So I do like the Green New Deal. [Laughter] I respect it greatly. It should be part of the dialogue of the next election. [Laughter] And I think it has tremendous promise and tremendous potential for the future of our country. Socialism is not about the environment.
01:15:58 - 01:16:17 (19 sec),"It's not about justice. It's not about virtue. Socialism is about only one thing. It's called ""power for the ruling class."" That's what it is. Look at what's happening in Venezuela and so many other places. All of us are here today because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism."
01:16:17 - 01:16:57 (40 sec),"And I heard, yesterday, a great speech from our Vice President Mike Pence, talking about this very subject -- and talking about it beautifully. The future belongs to those who believe in freedom. I have said it before and I'll say it again: America will never be a socialist country -- ever."
01:16:57 - 01:16:57 (0 sec),[Audience Chants USA]
01:16:57 - 01:17:09 (12 sec),"Young Americans -- I love young Americans. Speaking of young Americans -- Candace, stand up. Candace is getting married. Stand up. You've been incredible. Thank you. Your whole group has been great. You're getting married. Seems like a nice guy to me. [Laughter] Congratulations. You've been so great."
01:17:09 - 01:17:41 (32 sec),"Thank you very much, Candace. Thanks. And, Charlie, what a job you're doing. Where's Charlie? Where's Charlie? Where is Charlie Kirk? Because he has done an incredible job. Thank you very much, Charlie. But young Americans like you are leading the revival of American liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance."
01:17:41 - 01:18:21 (40 sec),"The anger -- the unbelievable anger -- I see it every day. Fortunately, for you, it's mostly pointed at me. [Laughter] You have the courage to speak the truth, to do what is right, and to fight for what you believe, and keep doing it. We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas."
01:18:21 - 01:18:57 (36 sec),"These ideas are dangerous. Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus. And, by the way, there's a young gentleman with us today. There's a young gentleman. I turned on my television the other day, and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face."
01:18:57 - 01:19:36 (39 sec),"Violently punched. And I said that's disgusting. By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things. But, of course, we would never do that. Because if I ever said violence, they would say, ""Donald Trump attacked."" No, no, no. Just for the media: I'm sure he's a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum."
01:19:36 - 01:20:09 (33 sec),"[Laughter] I've been there before with those people. I donât want to do it again. So, the man's name is Hayden Williams. Where's Hayden? Where is he? Where is he? Hayden, come up here. Come up here."
01:20:09 - 01:20:29 (19 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. So, at the Leadership Institute, we're committed to making campuses great again. And I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak. It's great -- it's great that I'm being recognized, and -- but there's so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse, if they dare to speak up on campus."
01:20:29 - 01:20:58 (29 sec),"So I'm glad that we could -- we could, you know, bring this to the forefront. And I'd just like to say, you know, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat. So, you know, it's as important now than ever the work at Leadership Institute and Campus Reform -- you know, exposing these liberal abuses to the public -- it's as important now as ever."
01:20:58 - 01:21:10 (12 sec),"And these students -- these students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom, and frankly, a love for you, Mr. President. So if you keep defending us, we'll keep defending you."
01:21:10 - 01:21:16 (5 sec),Thank you.
01:21:16 - 01:21:16 (1 sec),Thank you.
01:21:16 - 01:21:35 (19 sec),"Stay here for a second. So, here's the one thing. I was going to call him, but I don't have to now. I see him here. But here's the one thing: I learned a number of things. First of all, he can take a punch. If Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take a punch. [Laughter] Because you werenât going to go down no matter how -- that was a hell of a hard punch."
01:21:35 - 01:22:11 (36 sec),"He was a strong guy. But you know what? You've got yourself a great lawyer. I know your lawyer. She is a great lawyer. Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him. But he's probably got nothing, but sue him forever. But sue the college, the university. And maybe sue the state. Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us. Remember that."
01:22:11 - 01:22:52 (41 sec),"He took a punch for all of us. And we can never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden -- here's the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man. That's okay. [Laughter] Go get 'em, Hayden. Today I'm proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech -- if they want federal research dollars. [Audience Chants USA]"
01:22:52 - 01:23:57 (65 sec),"If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people, and old people, to speak. Free speech. And if they don't, it will be very costly. That'll be signed very soon. Every day, we're restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all."
01:23:57 - 01:24:22 (25 sec),"We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right. And we believe in religious liberty. And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms -- which is under siege, folks. They have a lot of plans. It's under siege."
01:24:22 - 01:25:17 (55 sec),"Be careful. But I'll protect you, I promise you that. I'll protect you. Because it all has to come through my office. And we hopefully are going to be here for six more years, so you're in good shape. We believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare. And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust."
01:25:17 - 01:25:59 (42 sec),"Every day, my presidency will defend American families. We will defend America's workers -- our great, great cherished workers -- that now we're taking care of. They're not losing their jobs. We're creating those jobs. We're not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore. We will defend the American way of life, and we will always defend America's borders."
01:25:59 - 01:26:39 (40 sec),"Because without borders, as I've said many times before, we don't have a country. The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet. Deadly cartels constantly -- daily, hourly -- violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill thousands and thousands of our citizens violently."
01:26:39 - 01:27:10 (30 sec),"What are these people talking about when they talk about the border? ""Keep it open."" Keep what open? Have you been there? Have you seen? I just got back. I've been there many times. I see what's happening. I don't like it. But I have to tell you, our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our law enforcement, the job they do -- and they don't have the backup of a wall, in many cases -- the job they do is incredible."
01:27:10 - 01:27:39 (29 sec),"These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere. When I was there two weeks ago, 26 people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande. Sounds nice, right? The Rio Grande. Rough. Rough stuff. Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing."
01:27:39 - 01:28:07 (28 sec),"And the paper doesn't write about it. The news doesn't write about it. In the last two years alone, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests. Think of what that means. Think of that -- arrests. I'm not talking about people coming in. I'm talking they went out and arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder."
01:28:07 - 01:28:37 (30 sec),"Who the hell wants to do that? Thank God they're doing it because I don't want to do it. It's dangerous. It's hard. But they love our country, and they're tough people, but they love our country. Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders."
01:28:37 - 01:28:55 (19 sec),"These are people that ICE is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we donât want them. We don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years. You want them to pay a price, but we don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years."
01:28:55 - 01:29:23 (27 sec),"And all the nonsense you hear about ""the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have"" -- it's not true, folks. Okay? It's false. It's false propaganda. Right? One recent study from FAIR -- F-A-I-R -- found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents."
01:29:23 - 01:29:45 (23 sec),"Those are the numbers. And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are -- the number is staggering. The number of illegals -- far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population. But you don't hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world."
01:29:45 - 01:30:16 (30 sec),Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there. Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly -- so badly. Incredible people. But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place. The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy.
01:30:16 - 01:30:49 (33 sec),"Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word ""rape."" The press went after me; I couldn't believe it. I said, ""Will it be like this always?"" The answer was yes."
01:30:49 - 01:31:45 (56 sec),"It even got worse. From day one, I mention the word ""rape."" If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what's really happening. That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts. Illegal immigration is not compassionate. It's inhumane, unjust, and cruel. The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that 2,000-mile trek up through Mexico -- and frankly, I wish Mexico would stop them at their northern border, at our -- I wish Mexico would stop them."
01:31:45 - 01:32:09 (24 sec),"Because you know, they have a border. They call it their southern border. It's 2,000 miles down from our southern border. I wish Mexico would stop them. But they have their own difficulties. Frankly, I understand that. We're working along well with them. And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we're doing."
01:32:09 - 01:32:42 (32 sec),"But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border. Think of that. True story, told to me by the Border Patrol. So true and so sad. Think of how evil that is. Think of how bad it is. Those caravans -- you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people."
01:32:42 - 01:33:14 (32 sec),"But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers. You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now. ""And what is it that you want asylum for? Why are you coming to America?"" ""Uh, murder."" She goes, ""What?"" ""Murder."" I mean, what's going on is incredible. And when those caravans are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to -- I've cut it way back."
01:33:14 - 01:33:39 (25 sec),"I've cut it way back. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Do you think they're giving us, as we say, their best and their finest? ""Oh, let's send our best people up to America. Let's have our best people go in the caravan so we can give America our greatest people."" No, no, no, no. They give us some very bad people."
01:33:39 - 01:34:14 (35 sec),"People with big, long crime records. People with tremendous violence in their past. Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers. They want to keep their good people because they're smart. It's so sad to see how stupid we've been. Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago."
01:34:14 - 01:34:50 (36 sec),"Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, last month I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people -- and they're good people -- some senators, mostly -- I tell you, the House has been fantastic."
01:34:50 - 01:35:04 (14 sec),"The House -- you know, backing we've had from the House has really been -- I'm talking about in the last short period of time. There's a lot of spirit in the House, and I think in the Senate too, but we're going to have to see because we have a vote coming up. And a lot of people talk about precedent. Precedent."
01:35:04 - 01:35:28 (24 sec),"That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we don't want. They're going to do that anyway, folks. The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election. That's the best way to stop that. They're going to do it anyway. They'll do it anyway."
01:35:28 - 01:35:53 (25 sec),"I watch -- good people, they're friends of mine, ""We're very concerned with setting precedent."" That's ""precedent"" not ""president."" [Laughter] Precedent. ""We're very concerned about setting precedent."" I'm very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country."
01:35:53 - 01:36:16 (23 sec),"That's what I'm concerned about. And the Democrats, they're going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it won't have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency. Because let me tell you -- they don't like it when I say it -- but we are being invaded. We're being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals."
01:36:16 - 01:36:47 (31 sec),"And we have to stop it. And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit. Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in Belarus, to ensure political stability in Burundi, and to defend the sovereignty of Lebanon."
01:36:47 - 01:37:13 (27 sec),"And you know what? That's okay. In Lebanon -- it's good. Fine. Use it. But we need it right here in our country. We have to use it for our country. Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands. Now we are protecting, finally, our people. You. Our people."
01:37:13 - 01:37:48 (34 sec),"And we are proudly standing with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants. If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border."
01:37:48 - 01:38:16 (28 sec),"We need an immigration policy that helps all Americans thrive, flourish, prosper. We need an immigration policy that's going to be great for our corporations and our great companies. We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens. And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities."
01:38:16 - 01:38:31 (15 sec),"And we want to end catch-and-release. We catch them, we realize they're a criminal, and we have to release them. Think of this: They come onto our land, they put one foot on our land. We now have to take them through a massive court trial. Who does this? Other countries say, ""Get the hell out of here."" We have to take them through court."
01:38:31 - 01:39:08 (37 sec),"So we catch them. We talk to them. If they're criminals, or if they're not, we release them. We say, ""Come back for a hearing in front of a judge."" You know how many judges you need to do this? We have 900,000 people backlogged. That's the good news. The bad news? Nobody shows up. Three percent of the people come back for a trial."
01:39:08 - 01:39:38 (30 sec),"It's insane. Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it. We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery. Every American, no matter where they're born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system. It is such -- you talk about an emergency. Our immigration system is so broken, folks."
01:39:38 - 01:40:07 (29 sec),"It's so broken. It's so sad to see. It's incompetent. It's laughed at all over the world. We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in Mexico. From China. They have a baby on our land. The baby becomes a citizen. ""Welcome to the United States"" for hopefully 90 years. Okay? And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen."
01:40:07 - 01:40:43 (36 sec),"This is like crazy. They used to call it ""anchor babies"" but they don't use that term anymore because it doesn't sound nice. Our laws are so crazy. But one by one, we're finding ways. You know, they call them loopholes. A lot of our laws -- loopholes. Well, I'm finding loopholes to get around the loophole."
01:40:43 - 01:41:17 (34 sec),"Okay? [Laughter] Because our Congress can't act. They can't act. They just can't act. The Democrats in Congress don't want to touch any of it. Visa lottery -- that's where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, ""Oh, here's a wonderful person. Wonderful."" You know, he killed four people."
01:41:17 - 01:41:41 (24 sec),"Here's -- here's another wonderful. [Laughter] And then they get in and we say, ""Gee, that person just came into our country. He just robbed a store and killed somebody."" How is that possible? Because they send us the people they don't want. The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations."
01:41:41 - 01:42:03 (22 sec),"Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute. We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves. We have people coming in. We support them from the day they come in until the day they die. We can't do that as a country."
01:42:03 - 01:42:26 (23 sec),"We can't afford to do that as a country. Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream. But that's going to be good for us in 2020. They're embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion. [Audience Boos]"
01:42:26 - 01:42:56 (30 sec),"Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death. Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I don't think I've ever heard, in Virginia, the governor -- a Democrat -- stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside."
01:42:56 - 01:43:13 (17 sec),"He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he'll talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done. And if they didn't want the child, who is now outside of the womb -- long outside of the womb -- they will execute the baby after birth. [Audience Boos]"
01:43:13 - 01:43:43 (31 sec),"They will execute the baby after birth. And that's one many people have never even heard of or thought about. This is a radical agenda by the Democrats. And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it. By the way, I have to say one thing: They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy."
01:43:43 - 01:44:12 (29 sec),They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to. But -- but -- big but -- they always stick together. And the Republicans don't remember that. Remember that. They always stick together. They vote in blocs. They have 47. We had a tremendous victory. We were given no credit. I can't go and campaign for all of the people in the House.
01:44:12 - 01:44:46 (34 sec),"Too many. And guys like Meadows wins by so many points he doesn't need any help. He doesn't need it. I say, ""Mark, do you need any help?"" ""No, I'm okay."" [Laughter] He'll win by 30, 35. They're okay. These guys -- you know a funny thing? The ones that love Trump, the ones that are really the Trumpers -- like Meadows, Jordan, Gates, so many of them."
01:44:46 - 01:45:06 (20 sec),"I donât want to -- I could just name so many. They're the ones that win with that. I mean, it's like they don't even have an election. It's the ones that sort of -- they're a little shy about embracing what we're all about, they get clobbered. They get clobbered. Take a look. Those are the ones that get clobbered."
01:45:06 - 01:45:31 (26 sec),"But the good news is they're all starting to find that out. Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions. Virtually every Democrat voted against protecting these precious babies. Every one. They vote in groups. And we did have that great victory."
01:45:31 - 01:45:56 (25 sec),"We won for 51. And two that we didn't like got out. They said they retired. They didn't retire. They were retired. They said, ""These two senators have decided to retire."" No, no, no. They retired because they had like very little support. Like how about 5 percent? Any percent. No, we did great."
01:45:56 - 01:46:42 (46 sec),"We had 53 we picked up in the Senate. They were going to win the Senate, remember? And I'll tell you, folks, I worked hard. I did 32 big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals. And the fake news back there, they love to say ""Donald Trump suffered a big defeat."" First of all, we won the Senate, which, frankly, judges -- you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the Senate, far more important."
01:46:42 - 01:47:12 (30 sec),"I really worked hard. But think of it. We won the Senate and we had this, like, tremendous victory. We get no credit at all. Wait until you see what happens. They say, ""Donald Trump suffered a humiliating defeat."" I said, ""I wasn't running."" [Laughter] And one of the commentators -- and I appreciate it -- one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, ""Excuse me, he didn't run."" You know, not all our candidates were exactly great."
01:47:12 - 01:47:38 (26 sec),"Let's face it. You know, you can only do so much. But wait until you see what's happening when I do run. And what they don't say is -- governor of Ohio, great guy. Mike. Mike. Mike was down six. He won by seven with one day. Right? He was down by six. One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech."
01:47:38 - 01:48:01 (23 sec),Jim Jordan was there. Everybody was there. It was a fantastic crowd like this. Like this. And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us. And he ended up winning. He was down by six; he won by seven. One day. Then we have Georgia -- the governor of Georgia. Great guy. Where's Georgia?
01:48:01 - 01:48:25 (25 sec),"Great guy. He was losing in the primary by 10. I got a call from David Perdue and Sonny Perdue -- two great guys. ""Could you endorse him?"" I said, ""Let me check."" And I checked him. He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper. [Laughter] And I said, ""I love this guy."" He's down by 10. He won by 40. Can you believe that?"
01:48:25 - 01:48:46 (21 sec),"I endorsed him, Mark. He won by 40. Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party -- not Democratic. It's Democrat. We have to do that. You know, it sounds prettier when we use ""Democratic."" I even like -- I hate to say in the speech, the ""Democrat Party"" because it doesn't sound good."
01:48:46 - 01:49:11 (25 sec),"But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't. [Laughter] They should change it because it sounds much better. Rhetorically, it's much better. Much better. But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address. I didn't think she was great. But she's their star."
01:49:11 - 01:49:18 (7 sec),"And who showed up? Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and President Obama. [Audience Boos]"
01:49:18 - 01:50:03 (45 sec),"And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard. And all our man had was Trump. [Laughter] And we kicked their ass. True. We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport. It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back. The problem was they gave the press, like these guys -- they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them couldn't see properly."
01:50:03 - 01:50:35 (33 sec),"I was so angry. But we had 55,000 people show up. I said, ""You're going to win the election."" He won the election. He won it fairly easily, against their star. And now David Perdue is going to win for senator in 2020. And then -- and then we had Florida, and many others. And we have a candidate, Ron DeSantis -- a friend."
01:50:35 - 01:50:57 (21 sec),"A friend of many of us in this room. But nobody knew he was running. He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win. He was scheduled to be the next governor of Florida. But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt. He's been a defender of me against these phony charges of Russia."
01:50:57 - 01:51:16 (19 sec),"Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. My wife said, ""You never spoke to anybody from Russia, darling."" I said, ""That's right."" [Laughter] But Ron DeSantis -- I like people that defend me. You know, when people defend me, I defend them. So he came. That's why I like Mark. That's why I like Mark Levin."
01:51:16 - 01:51:41 (26 sec),"And I'm not sure a lot of people like him. He's tough as hell. But I like him. I love him. But then we have Florida. So, Ron DeSantis is at three. Three. He calls up, ""Sir, can I have your endorsement?"" I said, ""Ron, you're at three. Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner -- has 22 million in the bank."
01:51:41 - 01:52:03 (22 sec),"His poll numbers are very good. He's up in the 20s or 30s."" I said, ""Ron, don't make me do this, Ron."" [Laughter] ""Sir, I can win."" ""All right, Ron. Here we go."" Because I know if he loses -- which almost never happens when I endorse somebody. Almost never. Only one time, and that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election."
01:52:03 - 01:52:29 (26 sec),"Nobody knew I did it. They got home, they said, ""I didn't know Trump endorsed him."" But we rarely, rarely lose. But I said, ""Ron, don't do it."" I said, ""All right, I'll do it."" He went from 3 to 60. To 60. And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support. He had every celebrity go into Florida."
01:52:29 - 01:52:55 (26 sec),"He had money all over the place. And Ron was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him. And we now have a great governor in the state of Florida. And I could mention many others -- other governors, many other states. But I'm not going to bore you with it. And I think -- I really think that it's incredible what we did in the midterms."
01:52:55 - 01:53:20 (26 sec),"I think it's incredible. Governor of Florida. Governor of Ohio. Remember, ""You can't win unless you win the state of Ohio."" We got the governor of Ohio, and he's great. Mike. We love you, Mike. As we defend American values at home, we are also defending. American security abroad. We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything."
01:53:20 - 01:53:46 (26 sec),"And we will never forget our military. We will never forget our veterans. We are taking care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor. Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks."
01:53:46 - 01:54:17 (31 sec),And we got them Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists. You had people that took advantage of our veterans. They've hit them. They were sadists. They were sick people. You couldnât fire them. You had thieves that were stealing -- openly stealing. You couldn't fire them. I got a bill passed: VA Accountability.
01:54:17 - 01:54:36 (20 sec),"Now you look at the guy, you say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired. Get out."" Nobody thought we could get it. For 40 years they tried to get it. For 40 years they tried to get it; they couldn't get it. And VA Choice, they thought -- for many, many decades they'd been trying to get VA Choice."
01:54:36 - 01:55:02 (26 sec),"You couldnât get it. Now, instead of waiting on line for two days, nine days, three weeks -- people were dying. People that weren't very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later. Now these great veterans, if there's a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor. We pay the bills."
01:55:02 - 01:55:33 (30 sec),"They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved -- for our veterans. We love our veterans. And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from Vietnam, where I had very productive meetings with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Very productive."
01:55:33 - 01:55:50 (17 sec),"We get along. We've developed a good relationship -- very good -- and made great historic progress. And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: ""Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that."" You know, they're telling me how to negotiate."
01:55:50 - 01:56:11 (21 sec),"These guys died. One administration gave billions of dollars to him and got nothing. And we haven't given him anything yet. I look forward to maybe doing something at some point. But I know one thing: I'm going to get other countries to give. Maybe not us, but I'm going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out."
01:56:11 - 01:56:42 (31 sec),"If it all works out. But I had to walk. Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal wasn't a deal that was acceptable to me. I don't like these deals that politicians make. They make a deal just for the sake of doing it. I don't want to do that. I want to make a deal that either works, or let's not make it. But the one thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up. No nuclear testing."
01:56:42 - 01:57:07 (25 sec),"We got our great people back. We get our great, great people. And that includes our beautiful, beautiful Otto -- Otto Warmbier -- whose parents I've gotten to know, who's incredible. And I'm in such a horrible position, because in one way I have to negotiate. In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto."
01:57:07 - 01:57:41 (34 sec),"And it's a very, very delicate balance. He was a special young man. And to see what happened was so bad. It was so bad. And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea, and any success that we hopefully have -- and we've had a lot. We're given no credit. They don't remember that, in the last days of the Obama administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on. Mountains were being -- these are big mountains."
01:57:41 - 01:58:01 (20 sec),"They were being shoved over three, four inches. People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons -- nuclear testing. So much. We're getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from many, many years ago. Mike Pence was in Hawaii. It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies."
01:58:01 - 01:58:22 (21 sec),"We've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to make progress. And I really think what we're doing there is very important. But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting. In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front."
01:58:22 - 01:58:43 (20 sec),"But you see, that's not what happened there. So already, I think we're negotiating. And I'll tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal. But they don't have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons. It's really a bad thing for them. So we'll see how it all goes."
01:58:43 - 01:59:06 (23 sec),"But I think it's going well. I think we learned a lot over the last couple of days. And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong. And that's an important thing, especially when we're dealing with this kind of a situation. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
01:59:06 - 01:59:32 (26 sec),"You saw that. Would you like to apologize? No. I'm not apologizing. Now you have a President who is standing up for America. After decades of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with American hands, American grit, and with beautiful, beautiful American steel."
01:59:32 - 02:00:05 (33 sec),"We are fighting to ensure that every young American inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul. Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of CPAC. And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible."
02:00:05 - 02:00:30 (26 sec),"Your organization is incredible. Matt and Mercedes, incredible. You're energized, you're mobilized, and you're engaged. We need your voice. We need your patriotism. We need your commitment. We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July. We are having, in Washington, D.C., a great tribute to America."
02:00:30 - 02:00:59 (29 sec),"I hope you can all come. Fourth of July -- keep it open. We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country. Those are the people we want. The Fourth of July. A salute to America. Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history. Now is the time to defend our American legacy."
02:00:59 - 02:01:23 (24 sec),"And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny. And, by the way, I'm watching those doors. Not one person has left, and I've been up here a long time. [Laughter] I said, ""Matt, is that okay?"" He said, ""I love it. Don't leave."" But not one person. So if you hear tomorrow, when they read ""people left"" -- nobody left early."
02:01:23 - 02:01:57 (34 sec),"There hasn't been one person that's left. But when you read it, you just say ""fake news."" This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God. Together, we are one people, one family, and one nation, forever united behind one great American flag."
02:01:57 - 02:02:33 (36 sec),"Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country. We're hooked in all over the country. Thank you very much. I want to thank CPAC. What a job they've done. What a job Matt Schlapp and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it's never been before. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much."
00:00:00 - 00:00:22 (23 sec),"That's such a great song. We should just let it play, right? [Laughter] We had a little luck with that song. And he's terrific -- a good supporter. We appreciate it. We really appreciate this, too. I know you have a record crowd; that's nice. It's always nice to set records. And I want to thank Sonny. And he's setting records."
00:00:22 - 00:00:39 (17 sec),"We're setting records together for farmers and for agriculture. We've had so many good weeks and good days, and it's only going to get better because we're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you're not even going to believe it. Your problem will be: What do we do? We need more acreage immediately."
00:00:39 - 00:00:56 (16 sec),"We got to plant. But I will say, we are doing some things with trade that are going to have a tremendous impact. You're going to be doing business with Canada, you're going to be doing business with places where it was very, very difficult to do business. It was very unfair. And a lot of great things are going to happen."
00:00:56 - 00:01:23 (28 sec),"So, I want to really thank everybody here, and I want to congratulate a very, very good and exciting football team that I watched yesterday, the New Orleans Saints. [Applause] You know, it's -- I can see there's a little group over here. I know who I'm talking to. The rest of the room is going like, Eh, I don't want to talk about that. [Laughter] But you have to say, Drew Brees -- he's one hell of a quarterback and it was a tremendous game."
00:01:23 - 00:01:50 (26 sec),"And so congratulations to the folks from this area and from this great state. [Applause] It's a great state. I'm thrilled to be here in a state that I've had a lot of luck with -- and I love a lot of people in this state; I know a lot of people -- for, really, a truly historic occasion. This is the 100th annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation -- 100 exactly."
00:01:50 - 00:02:22 (32 sec),"If it was 99 -- although, I was here for 99, too, I have to be honest, right? I like the farmers. What can I do? I like farmers. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. For 100 years, this organization has faithfully represented the men and women who are the backbone of our country, truly. Let us all show our appreciation for a very dear friend and a leader -- a great leader -- Zippy Duval."
00:02:22 - 00:02:56 (34 sec),"Where's Zippy? Zippy. [Applause] Where is, Zippy? What a job he does. He only called about 100 times to make sure I'm coming. [Laughter] Thank you, Zippy. Great job. On this special anniversary, we gather to celebrate America's proud farming heritage. Through your sweat, through all of your work, the strength of your hands, and the faith in your hearts, the American farmer feeds, and fuels, and sustains our nation."
00:02:56 - 00:03:29 (33 sec),"So true. We are joined today by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. Thank you, Governor, for being here. Thank you. Thank you, John Bel. [Applause] Thank you. Along with many members of Congress who are true champions of American agriculture. An incredibly talented man, a great doctor -- he knows more about healthcare than anybody, and he's somebody that -- he's really helped us out in so many different ways."
00:03:29 - 00:03:47 (19 sec),"And he's yours: Senator Bill Cassidy. Bill? Thank you very much, Bill. [Applause] Appreciate it. A woman who had a tremendous victory -- she came in for a short period of time. She was appointed, and it's always hard when you're appointed. If you look -- I don't know about this, Cindy, but you take a look -- they don't do too well."
00:03:47 - 00:04:17 (30 sec),"You did very well. You won in an incredible state: Mississippi. Cindy Hyde-Smith, thank you. That was a great win. [Applause] A brilliant guy -- he's very deceiving. My wife said, I love watching him on television. And I said, Who? John Kennedy. I said, John Kennedy? I don't know. But, you know, I thought maybe she was talking about the other John Kennedy."
00:04:17 - 00:04:37 (20 sec),"She was talking -- this is a man who is totally brilliant. You know, I don't know if you know what this means: Oxford. Right? He went to Oxford. Oxford is a very -- I'm very much into the world of schools. Oxford -- you have to be very, very smart to go to Oxford. And he's very smart. He also loves this state."
00:04:37 - 00:04:55 (18 sec),"He loves the people. We gave a rally the night before he won that was incredible. And I looked -- and I looked at that crowd. We had to have 40,000 people or more at a hangar -- an airport hangar. I said, You know, John Kennedy? You're going to win. And he won and he won big. And he's my friend. John Kennedy."
00:04:55 - 00:05:21 (26 sec),"Thank you, John. [Applause] Oxford. Oxford John. [Laughs] Great. Congressman Ralph Abraham. Thank you, Congressman. Where are you? Congressman? [Applause] Great job you do. He does a great job. Congressman Garrett Graves. And you know Garrett. Thank you, Garrett. Good job. Young, strong, smart. [Applause] We got a lot of good politicians down here."
00:05:21 - 00:05:50 (29 sec),"And the legend from Louisiana -- a man who's got a lot of courage. He was playing second base and it didn't work out so well for him that day, but I have never seen anybody with more strength and really more courage than Steve Scalise. Steve Scalise. [Applause] He got hit hard. He got hit hard. He never even thought about quitting."
00:05:50 - 00:06:05 (15 sec),"He -- I was there the night, in his hospital. And they didn't think he was going to make it. And I looked at him; he wasn't looking too good, I have to tell you. This is the first time I'm telling you this, Steve; you weren't looking too sharp. And his wife loves him, because she was a mess. She had tears pouring down."
00:06:05 - 00:06:24 (19 sec),"I'll tell you a couple of these little facts. Your family loves you, Steve. But all of a sudden, he started making a little progress, a little more. Worked so hard. And then, a few months ago, he was in a baseball game. And it was the Republicans against the Democrats. He's playing second base. And he didn't have great mobility, to be honest."
00:06:24 - 00:06:44 (20 sec),"In other words, moving like a foot to his right, a foot to the left -- that was about it. And he gets the first pitch of the game. This is in a stadium, and a lot of people watching, and it's on television. And they put him at second base for one play. And the first hit is a smash -- ground ball -- hit at Steve."
00:06:44 - 00:07:02 (18 sec),"And I'm pretty good at this stuff; I look, I say, Oh, that's going right to second base. It went right in him -- right at him. He bent down, stopped that ball, threw it to first. The place went crazy. And he then walked off the field in great triumph. [Laughter and applause] Who could have done that but my Steve, right?"
00:07:02 - 00:07:22 (20 sec),"[Applause] That was incredible. That was incredible. He's a courageous guy. He's a great guy. He's also a really fine person. So, Steve Scalise -- what you've been through, Steve, is incredible. And congratulations. Incredible job. As you all know, there is currently a tremendous humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border."
00:07:22 - 00:07:41 (19 sec),"It's tremendous. It's been there for years. It's been there for decades. But because of what we're doing and because of how well our country is doing -- And please sit down. Please. I'm just looking -- and then the media -- the fake news -- they'll say, He got no standing ovations. You know why? Because everybody stayed standing."
00:07:41 - 00:08:11 (30 sec),"[Laughter] Wait until you see that. It's true. Oh, they'll do it. They'll figure something out. [Applause] That's true. [Applause] That's true. [Laughs] [Applause] That's true. They can figure it out. They can take the best thing -- I go home, I say, Darling, I did such a great job. Wait until you see the news tomorrow on something. [Laughter] North Korea, China."
00:08:11 - 00:08:26 (16 sec),"We're doing great in the trade deal. China -- this, that. They can make anything you do look bad. But I was watching as you're standing. And I said, You know, if they sit, it's probably better for me, because every once in a while, they'll stand. [Laughter] The other way, they'll say, The crowd did not appreciate him."
00:08:26 - 00:08:49 (22 sec),"They didn't give him one standing ovation. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you very much. Women and children are being ruthlessly exploited at our southern border by vicious coyotes -- who would think of this? Human traffickers. Now, when you hear the words human traffickers, you think about 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago."
00:08:49 - 00:09:14 (25 sec),"You wouldn't think it's worse today in the world -- this is a world problem -- than it's ever been. And the reason it's worse is because of the Internet. They target young women. They target young children -- the Internet. And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped -- their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape."
00:09:14 - 00:09:32 (18 sec),"They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the backseat of cars and vans, and they go -- they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that. They come in through our border, where we don't have any barriers or walls."
00:09:32 - 00:09:54 (23 sec),"And they drive right in and they have no problems. And we'll get that stopped. We're going to have a wall. We're going to have a barrier. We're going to have something that's going to be very strong. [Applause] One of the most important things. And I've built a lot of wall. You saw it the other day. They kept saying, You didn't build wall. I said, I built wall. So I actually decided I'd better put a picture for you to see."
00:09:54 - 00:10:22 (28 sec),"But we built a lot more than that. And we renovated a lot of pretty good stuff that we made good again. It was in very bad shape. But we've done a lot. We want to finish it because, you know, you can't have openings. Because if you have an opening, they go here and they just sort of go over this way. They find the open spot, they come in. And we have to build -- what we have to build -- probably a total of 550 miles including the renovations."
00:10:22 - 00:10:43 (21 sec),"And we've done a lot of work. People don't talk about it. I don't talk about it because, until we're finished, the big thing is we have to get it done. And we've had great support from John, your senator; Bill, your senator; from everybody. We've had tremendous -- Steve is working hard in the House. Your congressmen are working really hard."
00:10:43 - 00:11:07 (23 sec),"Really hard. Because it's common sense. What we're talking about is common sense. Last month alone, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought across our borders. Twenty thousand. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the journey up from Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador. Think of that. Think of that."
00:11:07 - 00:11:37 (31 sec),"Hard to believe. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are being smuggled across the border. Most of the drugs coming into our country come in through the southern border -- and much of it comes through areas that are not your portals -- including meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl. Heroin alone, if you look at the heroin epidemic -- it's an epidemic -- heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week."
00:11:37 - 00:11:58 (21 sec),And 90 percent of it -- at least -- crosses our southern border. It comes in through our southern border. And I've spent a lot of time with Secret Service and with Border Patrol and ICE -- incredible people -- and they show me the methods that they use -- how they hide it. They put it in hubcaps. They put it in engines.
00:11:58 - 00:12:22 (24 sec),"They put it in areas you wouldn't believe. They're brilliant, in many ways. They're brilliant. You wouldn't even think of what they do to get things in. And we can stop it. But we can't stop it if we're going to play politics. And the numbers you're talking about are peanuts compared -- you'll make the money back numerous times a year."
00:12:22 - 00:13:05 (43 sec),"In 2017, drugs killed over 70,000 of our fellow citizens -- think of that, that's like a football stadium loaded up -- and imposed costs on our society in excess of $700 billion dollars. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested 266,000 illegal aliens -- think of that -- with criminal records, including 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent murders or killings."
00:13:05 - 00:13:29 (24 sec),"The crisis of illegal immigration impacts all Americans -- threatening public safety, overwhelming public resources, straining our local schools and hospitals, undermining U.S. workers, and claiming countless innocent lives. And I will tell you, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally."
00:13:29 - 00:14:05 (36 sec),"They have to come in through a process. [Applause] Thank you. As President, the defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty. And this is the defense of our nation, just like we prepare for other nations that you think more traditionally is what that sentence refers to. When it comes to keeping the American people safe, I will never, ever back down."
00:14:05 - 00:14:22 (17 sec),"I didn't need this fight. This is a rough fight. We're dealing against people who think that if they can stop me from building the wall -- again, we've already done a lot of work -- but they think that's a good thing for 2020, because they're not going to win. They think if they can stop me from building the wall, that's good."
00:14:22 - 00:14:40 (17 sec),"This is the reason why they don't want the wall built -- because they all know it works. They all approved it numerous times. I mean, Chuck Schumer had his hand up every time this would come up. The senators know this. They're only doing this because of the 2020 election because I said I'll build the wall and I'm going to build the wall."
00:14:40 - 00:15:17 (38 sec),"And it's only one of many things that I promised. I mean, if you look at -- [Applause] -- I got you the biggest tax cut -- beyond the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. ANWR, getting rid of the individual mandate, the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country -- and we're going further. [Applause] That might be the biggest reason that our country is doing so much better than other countries and why we're doing so well."
00:15:17 - 00:15:36 (19 sec),"But they view this as a political thing because this was one of the big things I -- I said, We're going to do tax cuts. We're going to do regulation. We're going to doâ¦ And, you know, we've done most of what we said. One of the -- that's a lot of news back there. One of the folks back there said that He's actually done more than he promised. It's true."
00:15:36 - 00:15:58 (22 sec),"I have actually done more than I promised. We've done a lot. Even with the veterans. [Applause] A lot of veterans in Louisiana. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Choice approved, which is pretty amazing. They've been trying to get that for years and years -- decades and decades. And we got Accountability -- VA Accountability."
00:15:58 - 00:16:21 (23 sec),"When you had somebody treating our veterans horribly, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't fire them -- whether it's unions, or whether it's civil service, or whatever it may have been. But for decades and decades, somebody could do anything they wanted. They can steal, they could abuse our veterans, they can be sadists, they can do whatever they want and you couldn't fire them."
00:16:21 - 00:16:47 (26 sec),"And I got Accountability approved. Everyone said you couldn't get that -- too much power against it. We got it done, and now we can say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here. We don't want you taking care of our veterans. [Applause] That was a big thing. A lot of help from those people. So we got a lot done, but they view the wall as being a big item that, if I don't do it, you know, it's a negative."
00:16:47 - 00:17:14 (27 sec),"It's a negative. And I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm doing it because we have to do it. It's common sense. We have to do it. If you look at the caravans coming up, if you look at what's going on -- you take a look. If we didn't have some of those walls -- the military has been incredible. They came up and they built some barriers -- they kept thousands and thousands of people from overrunning various sections of our country."
00:17:14 - 00:17:39 (25 sec),"We've done a great job at the border, but we need that extra -- we need that barrier because you can't do this. You can have all the people you want dressed in military. You can have ICE. You can have Border Patrol. If you don't have that barrier, there's not a thing you can do. You know, they all say, We like technology. I like technology, too."
00:17:39 - 00:18:08 (29 sec),"But we can have all the drones in the world flying around; we can have all the sensors in the world, but if you don't have a strong steel or concrete barrier, there's no way you're going to stop these people from rushing. Last week -- and we have no idea who they are. And you got some -- I'm sure -- very good ones, but you got some real bad ones."
00:18:08 - 00:18:52 (44 sec),"Last week, I traveled to McAllen, Texas to tour the border and meet with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. These great patriots made clear what they need from Congress and to end this terrible crisis. And we will end it. We will end it. You know, when we have proper security, people aren't going to come, except for the people we want to come because we want to take people in to help our farmers, et cetera."
00:18:52 - 00:19:09 (17 sec),"Very important. We're going to make that actually easier for them -- to help the farmers. [Applause] Because you need these people. No, you need these people. We're going to make it easier. [Applause] I mean, I'm glad I told you that because, you know, look, you're in that business and a lot of people don't understand this."
00:19:09 - 00:19:29 (20 sec),"You need those -- you need people to help you with the farms. And I'm not going to rule that out. I'm going to make that easier for them to come in and to work the farms. You've had some people for 20, 25 years. They're incredible. Then they go home and they can't get back in. That's not going to happen."
00:19:29 - 00:19:59 (30 sec),"But we're keeping the wrong ones out, okay? We don't want the wrong ones coming into our country. And, for that, it's going to be almost impossible to get in. For the people that work the farms, that have been here, that have gone through this very short but good process, that are going to help our country, it's going to be easier for them to get in that what they have to go through now."
00:19:59 - 00:20:26 (26 sec),"So just remember that. [Applause] I know a lot about the farming world. And, if I don't, Sonny teaches me. They explained that there is no substitute for a wall -- these are the ICE people and the Border Patrol people -- or a physical barrier. There is no substitute. Where a barrier exists, illegal crossings plummet dramatically."
00:20:26 - 00:20:56 (30 sec),"In El Paso, they had -- it was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. A wall was put up. It went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight -- overnight. Does that tell you something? [Applause] And I can give you many examples of that."
00:20:56 - 00:21:22 (26 sec),"They say it's medieval -- a wall. It is medieval. So is a wheel. I always say a wheel. But every time I look out, they all have wheels. You know, they may have gone electric and they may have done lots of different things, but every car I've seen still has wheels. [Laughter] Wheels work and walls work."
00:21:22 - 00:21:41 (18 sec),"You know, there's some things you can't beat. [Applause] That's why we've asked Congress to fund a steel barrier, or whatever you want to call it. This barrier will stop illegal activity, while directing lawful trade, travel, and commerce to our ports of entry. These ports are America's doors, but doors only work when you have strength."
00:21:41 - 00:22:00 (20 sec),"We need strength. Right now, we have weakness. They're forming a new caravan in Honduras. Honduras is not helping us. They could stop it. We send them hundreds of millions of dollars a year -- El Salvador, Honduras, and other places -- Guatemala -- hundreds of millions, but they don't help us, like so many nations."
00:22:00 - 00:22:22 (22 sec),We help them; they don't help us. We don't even get their votes often when we need their vote in the United Nations. They don't vote for us. Why? Because the wrong people are asking them. So those days are over. So I said just before I came -- we're looking at a whole plan -- why are we sending them money if they're allowing caravans to form right in the middle of their cities?
00:22:22 - 00:22:46 (24 sec),"Why are we sending them money? [Applause] A lot of changes have been made in this country in less than two years, I will tell you that. A lot of changes. And really good changes -- changes that people like you, with common sense and smarts, fully understand. And that's why we're liking where we are and the country is changing very rapidly for the better."
00:22:46 - 00:23:12 (27 sec),"As part of our overall border security plan, we have also asked Congress to approve cutting-edge technology to detect drugs. There's incredible technology today. So when these cars do come in through the ports of entry, you have technology today that's so incredible. We don't use it. We don't have it because our leaders decided not to spend the money."
00:23:12 - 00:23:35 (23 sec),"Well, you make it back every month -- probably more than that -- because the drugs coming through the southern border are destroying the fabric of our country. It's so bad. It's so bad. [Applause] So we have to stop it. This technology is incredible. To fund more agents -- we're putting that high on the list -- officers, beds."
00:23:35 - 00:24:06 (31 sec),"Believe it or not, we're one of the only countries -- I say one, because every time I say something else they'll say, Oh, well, there was a country that also did it. Somebody comes into our country, they touch one foot on the ground, and we have to catch them. It's called, catch. We then take their names and we bring them to a court -- can you believe this?"
00:24:06 - 00:24:24 (17 sec),"-- and we release them. But, see, we're trying to do catch-and-hold. Catch-and-not-release. But you have to release. So we release. And they go into our country, and then you announce -- these are the laws -- then you say, Come back in three years for your trial. Tell me, what percentage of people come back?"
00:24:24 - 00:24:43 (19 sec),"Would you say 100 percent? No, you're a little off. Like, how about 2 percent? [Laughter] And those people, you almost don't want, because they cannot be very smart. [Laughter] Two percent. Two percent. Two percent come back. Those two percent are not going to make America great again, that I can tell you."
00:24:43 - 00:25:02 (19 sec),"[Laughter and applause] Crazy. So we have that and we have chain migration, where somebody comes in, and then his mother comes in, his father comes in, his grandmother comes in, his uncle comes in, his cousins come in. We had a guy -- a radical Islamic terrorist in New York -- area I know very well -- driving down the West Side highway."
00:25:02 - 00:25:23 (21 sec),"Beautiful -- Hudson River to his right. We built this gorgeous park all along the river. It's gorgeous. People are running; they're in great shape. We ought to all -- some of these guys in the front row, they should do it with me. We could run. [Laughter] Some of my friends over there. Sonny -- maybe Sonny and I will go take a jog."
00:25:23 - 00:25:43 (20 sec),"[Laughter] But you know what? I'll tell you, these are people that are great people, and they're running and they keep -- and this horrible person, going down 60 miles an hour down a highway, decides, Oh, that's nice. We'll make a right turn. Hits a whole group of people purposely, screaming all sorts of things that they scream."
00:25:43 - 00:26:11 (28 sec),"And 8 people died; 12 or 13 were injured. Nobody talks about the injured. You know, some of the injured lost legs, lost arms. You know, this is -- they say, Oh, well, 12 were injured. You know, like, injured -- you think, like, a headache. No, no. They lost arms. They lost legs. One lost two legs. So 12 were horribly injured."
00:26:11 - 00:26:32 (21 sec),"And he's allowed to have his family come here. So they checked, and they said that he had about 22 people came in -- chain migration. In other words, because he's here -- so a whole group of people come in. And we don't want that. We have another one -- the lottery. The lottery. We take people from countries through the lottery."
00:26:32 - 00:26:59 (27 sec),"Now, this is common sense. Do you think the country is giving us their finest? No, they're not. No, they're not. They're giving us the opposite of their finest. And we have a lottery system. Oh, let's pick him out. Oh, wonderful. Doesn't work out too well, this lottery system. But this is the law. This was passed by Democrats and, I guess, Republicans."
00:26:59 - 00:27:18 (19 sec),"You know, maybe they voted -- who knows? But these are laws that have to be changed. These are -- these are sick, demented laws that we have to change. We can't allow this to keep happening. The people that are sent to our country are not the people that we want. They come in through the lottery. They come in through chain migration."
00:27:18 - 00:27:50 (31 sec),"Think of it: This man that killed 8 people and so badly injured 12, they say he's about 22 relatives coming in that are here. And take a look at how well his relatives are doing. It's not a good picture. So we have to change our laws. It's very hard because the Democrats don't want to change them. But I hope that common sense and people like this can persuade them, because it's gotten to a point where you have to. We really have no choice."
00:27:50 - 00:28:16 (27 sec),"And we're fighting hard. We're fighting very hard for you. We're making a lot of progress, I can tell you that. [Applause] Here with us today is Jim Chilton from Arizona. Jim's ranch runs along the U.S-Mexico border. The deadly -- very deadly -- Sinaloa cartel, one of the most vicious drug cartels anywhere in the world, runs a major drug trafficking route right through Jim's ranch."
00:28:16 - 00:28:36 (19 sec),"Many of these routes used to run through San Diego until the wall was built by us, by me. [Applause] Sorry about that, Jim. [Laughs] I think Jim has just got angry at me; he just heard that. Sorry, Jim. Because now, what they did, they went to Jim's ranch. I think I cost him a lot of money. Maybe he won't stand up after all."
00:28:36 - 00:29:35 (60 sec),"But it's a very sad situation. In the last two years, the cameras on Jim's ranch have captured roughly 1,000 pictures of major drug packers, they call them. For years, these criminals have damaged Jim's property, injured his livestock, and started dozens of fire, which Jim estimates cost more than $2 million dollars in 2017 alone."
00:29:35 - 00:30:09 (33 sec),"Last June, a Border Patrol agent was checking sensors on the Clinton's -- and Chilton's ranch when he was shot multiple times by these sinister drug traffickers. Multiple times. And they don't even think about. By the way, they shoot -- it's not like, Oh, gee, I committed a terrible thing. They don't even think about it. They don't even think."
00:30:09 - 00:30:21 (13 sec),"They wake up the next morning and they couldn't care less. As Jim has said, Every time I leave the ranch, my wife doesn't know whether I'll ever return. I would like to ask Jim to come up and say a few words. Jim, please come up. Thank you. [Applause]"
00:30:21 - 00:30:31 (9 sec),"Mr. President, we need a wall. [Applause] I would say we need a wall all around all the length of the border. We've got to stop the drug packers bringing drugs in to poison our people. And I would say to Speaker Pelosi, walls are not immoral. [Applause]"
00:30:31 - 00:30:50 (19 sec),"In fact, I've traveled around the world, and the biggest wall I've ever seen is around the Vatican. Now, you can't tell me that the wonderful priest and officials of the Roman Catholic Church, including the Pope, are immoral. They have a wall. Why can't we? [Applause]"
00:30:50 - 00:31:11 (20 sec),"Thank you, Jim. [Applause] Thank you, Jim. And I'm sorry for your problems, but we'll get it straightened out. The government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: The Democrats will not fund border security, our safety, our national security. People come from many countries."
00:31:11 - 00:31:34 (23 sec),"When I was at the wall the other day, Border Patrol said they have 150 people they caught that day who weren't from Mexico. I said, That's a strange statement. They said, No, these are the people that weren't from Mexico. And I was surprised. Three were from Pakistan. Four were from another Mid-East -- two Mid-East countries."
00:31:34 - 00:32:00 (26 sec),"And many of them were from other countries, including China -- countries all over the world. A hundred and fifty of the people, as he said, were not from Mexico. Now, they caught many, many more, but that's a 150 people coming from companies that -- you know, really, countries that you wouldn't believe. They will not approve the measures we need to keep America safe -- the Democrats."
00:32:00 - 00:32:18 (18 sec),"We can't do that. We can't do that because this is of paramount importance to our country. And again, I could take it nice and easy. I could enjoy myself. I could relax. I've been in the White House because I think it's very important to be there. And other people went on a nice, wonderful vacation over the weekend."
00:32:18 - 00:32:44 (26 sec),They had a great time. I would have loved to have been with them. I didn't like the look of it. I would have loved to have been with them. But we have a very big problem. This should have been done by other Presidents. Just like the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem should have been done -- it was promised by many other Presidents. [Applause]
00:32:44 - 00:33:07 (23 sec),"Just like we're doing the job on North Korea, just like we're doing the job with China -- we're getting it done. We're getting it done. We're getting it all done. But it would have been nice if other administrations were able to do it. But we have to do the border. In the meantime, the USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown."
00:33:07 - 00:33:30 (23 sec),"We thank you for your support and patriotism. And we fight to defend our nation. We are fighting very hard to defend our nation. And many people that aren't getting a payment, that aren't being paid, have let us know in the strongest of terms -- a big amount -- they said, Sir, what you're doing is of paramount importance."
00:33:30 - 00:33:56 (25 sec),"Do the job right, and we are with you, 100 percent. You'd be surprised at how many people have said that. And it's not easy for them, but it's a lot of people. [Applause] So I'm asking all of our citizens to call your Democrat lawmakers and ask them to pass a bill that secures our border, protects our country, and now reopens our government."
00:33:56 - 00:34:17 (21 sec),"Because as soon as they do that, we reopen our government. You would think that would be a very simple task. On every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers. We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible. I saw what was going on in Canada -- the way you were treated."
00:34:17 - 00:34:41 (24 sec),"Horrible. And they treated their farmers great. Great. We changed it with the new trade deal we made with Mexico and Canada. And opening up new markets to export -- many, many new markets are being opened up. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And the farmers got hit probably as hard as anybody."
00:34:41 - 00:35:18 (37 sec),"We're reversing harmful federal intrusion. And to keep family farms in the family, we have virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Small business owners and corporations and others -- small business -- it was a terrible thing that was happening, where your parents -- you love your parents -- they're farmers -- they love their farms."
00:35:18 - 00:35:34 (15 sec),"Everybody loves their farm. The kids -- they want to grow up on the farm. They want to someday run the farm, own the farm. And they couldn't because they had very large estate taxes to pay. So they go out and borrow money, and then it turned a little bit bad. And all of the sudden, they'd end up losing the farm because they had to pay the estate tax."
00:35:34 - 00:35:53 (19 sec),"We got rid of it, folks. So if you love your children, you'll like me. If you don't love your children, and you weren't going to leave the farm to them, it probably doesn't matter too much, okay? [Laughter] Does anybody here not love their children? Wow, that's a lot of people -- not one? Okay, you don't want to say."
00:35:53 - 00:36:09 (15 sec),"That's all right. [Laughter] That's like a lot of the people that went to the polls; they voted for Trump. [Laughter] They said, We don't want to talk about it. Then we won. We won two years ago. In November, we won. [Applause] And everybody is trying -- they're still trying to figure out what happened."
00:36:09 - 00:36:37 (28 sec),"We don't have to talk about it. We know what we're doing. We're ensuring that ethanol remains a vital part of America's energy future, with E-15. And we're making it available year round -- all 12 months. That was a big, big difference for the farmers. [Applause] Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst -- your senators -- a lot of great people were very strong on that."
00:36:37 - 00:37:00 (23 sec),"And it also creates additional, because, if you noticed, I think we saw $1.75 for gasoline today, coming in. I like to do that; I'm one of these guys. [Applause] I'm riding in this incredible car, and I'm driving, and I'm looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas. How many other Presidents -- you think Hillary Clinton would have done that?"
00:37:00 - 00:37:20 (20 sec),"I don't think so. I don't think so. [Laughter and applause] I'm in the Beast -- the world's most expensive car. It's like being in an army tank that goes 50 miles an hour, right? I'm in the Beast and I'm looking at gas stations. I say, Fellas, slow up. I can't see. [Laughter] They say, $1.75. That didn't happen by accident, folks."
00:37:20 - 00:37:41 (21 sec),"That didn't happen by accident. People think it does; it doesn't. Nothing happens -- very few, very little happens by accident. Nobody else would have done what we did for the farmers, with the estate taxes and so many other things. In the two years before my election, agricultural exports dropped by nearly $23 billion."
00:37:41 - 00:38:13 (32 sec),"Remember that: Before I got here, it was heading south. A lot of people say, Oh, gee, how are we doing? It was going bad. If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office. They were less. Now they're up nearly $14 billion. In December, just a few days before Christmas, I was proud to sign the Farm Bill."
00:38:13 - 00:38:49 (36 sec),"We got it done. That wasn't easy either. [Applause] That was not easy. Senators, Congressmen, thank you. That group did it. [Applause] That was not an easy one, John and Bill, was it, huh? That wasn't easy. But we got it done. The first to be passed, on time, in over 30 years. Got it done. And I've authorized Secretary Perdue to be strong on work rules for the Food Stamp program, through regulations allowed by the bill."
00:38:49 - 00:39:12 (24 sec),"So I know you have a great Secretary. He'll do what's right. The Farm Bill delivers for our farmers on a wide range of key priorities. On critical farm programs, such as crop insurance, you will have the support you need to plan for the future. It increases the amount farmers can borrow so you can expand and improve your businesses."
00:39:12 - 00:39:37 (25 sec),"It also secures the $600 million commitment we made to build a modern, effective, rural broadband across America's heartland. You're not well serviced. [Applause] That's something the great, great middle part of our country has been complaining about for a long time. You're not properly serviced. You will be now."
00:39:37 - 00:40:08 (31 sec),"You will be now. That bill is a great bill for the farmer. Last year, when I spoke to you, we had just passed our historic tax cuts. Here with us today is Kalena Bruce from Stockton, Missouri. Kalena is a rancher, and also an accountant for local farmers. Under our new tax plan, which lowers rates for small businesses and doubles the tax child credit -- so important, that child tax credit."
00:40:08 - 00:40:30 (22 sec),"You know who fought for that? A young woman named Ivanka Trump. That's all she wanted. Dad? Dad? We have to get that passed, Dad. [Applause] I said, Okay, Ivanka. Okay. Okay. [Laughter] It turned out to be so popular. Kalena has seen that many families will save upwards of $4,000 in taxes this year alone."
00:40:30 - 00:40:54 (25 sec),"Kalena, I want to thank you and all of those incredible people that you represent. And just keep up the great work. Where is Kalena? Where is Kalena? She's around here someplace. Hi, Kalena. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. [Applause] We're also leading the most sweeping regulatory reform at any time in our history."
00:40:54 - 00:41:21 (27 sec),"The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled back almost $400 million in regulatory costs last year alone. And this year, they're projected to more than double those savings. We're saving farmers and ranchers from one of the most ridiculous regulations ever imposed on anybody in our nation: the Waters of the United States rule."
00:41:21 - 00:41:59 (38 sec),"[Applause] Disaster -- other than the title. Such a beautiful title. It was a total kill on farmers, on builders, on everybody. It was a total kill. Sounds so nice. In fact, I looked at John Kennedy, when I signed that. I said, John, I'm going to get killed for this one. Because what we did was take something -- the Water of the United States. How beautiful is that?"
00:41:59 - 00:42:19 (20 sec),"And yet, everything inside was a total kill on you -- and other businesses, by the way. [Applause] And we didn't get killed, did we, John, huh? We didn't. They love it. So many people have come -- and, you know, the time when I signed that bill, I had ranchers, farmers, and some homebuilders behind me. And these are tough people."
00:42:19 - 00:42:38 (19 sec),"They were strong, tough men and women. And half of them were crying because we basically -- our government stole their property. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't build. They couldn't do anything. They were crying. I said, What are you crying about? The one guy -- I don't think he cried in his whole life."
00:42:38 - 00:43:00 (22 sec),"I don't think he cried when we was a baby. He was crying. [Laughter] He said, Sir, you gave me back my life. You gave me back my property. They took it away -- environmentally, took it away. And you're going to do the right thing. In the audience today is Val Wagner from Monango, North Dakota. Val -- [Applause]. [Laughs] It's a good place."
00:43:00 - 00:43:22 (22 sec),"[Laughter] You have a great new senator, by the way. [Applause] A great new senator. Really great. Val and her husband would love to expand their farm for their four boys, but under the Waters of the United States rule, they would have to pay tens and of thousands of dollars in fines because of the prairie potholes on their land."
00:43:22 - 00:43:48 (25 sec),"Do you all know what prairie potholes are? Yes, you do. I don't, but it sounds bad. [Laughter] To Val and to every farmer, we are going to keep federal regulators out of your -- out of your tanks -- your stock tanks, your drainage ditches, your puddles, and your ponds. And you know exactly what I'm talking about."
00:43:48 - 00:44:21 (34 sec),"You could have a pond -- a little pond -- and they consider it a lake. [Applause] And you're regulated as though it were a lake. We're going to get government off your backs so you can earn a living and support your families doing what you love. And I know what you love. Farmers love what they're doing. [Applause] We also passed legislation to rebuild our water infrastructure, including our nation's inland waterways, which carry more than 60 percent of our agricultural products."
00:44:21 - 00:44:48 (27 sec),"We are replacing one-sided, unfair trade deals. We have so many nations -- it's a one-sided deal. With China, every year, for many years, we're losing $375 billion -- not million, billion dollars. We're working on that very strongly. You see what's going on. We're doing very well. We have the European Union -- they don't treat us right."
00:44:48 - 00:45:05 (17 sec),"They treat our farmers terribly. You can hardly sell into the -- they have barriers and they have tariffs that are massive. But with the farmers, they don't want your product. We're working with them; they have to treat us fairly. We're losing $151 billion a year with the European Union. It sounds so nice, right?"
00:45:05 - 00:45:21 (17 sec),"The European Union. And then the press gets angry. They say, Donald Trump is not treating the European Union fairly. Well, that's because they're not treating us fairly, folks. I want to be nice. In fact, they said my poll numbers are very bad in Europe. I said, They should be. [Laughter] No, seriously."
00:45:21 - 00:45:59 (38 sec),"They said, When he started off, he had 87 percent. That means you could be the king of any country. Now, they [Inaudible] because I'm representing our country; I'm not representing those country -- you know, one of those [Inaudible]. [Applause] True. It's true. They said, His poll numbers have tanked. And I said, Oh, damn it. What's going on? Damn it. And then I said, Oh, it's in Europe."
00:45:59 - 00:46:24 (25 sec),"That's okay. [Laughter] No, we get along well with them. And they're a lot of great people and great leaders. But, look, I'm not blaming them. I don't blame China. I mean, China -- $375 billion a year, we lose. It's really more than that, but that's like the conservative number. I think it's $504 [Billion]. But I'm giving you conservative because I don't want to be criticized for using wrong numbers, right?"
00:46:24 - 00:46:43 (19 sec),"[Laughter] But I don't blame China. I was in China making a speech, and President Xi -- who's a friend of -- great guy. But he represent them; I represent us. And he's sitting over here. And I'm talking to this massive crowd of people. And I'm talking about how China is bad, bad, bad. And I'm saying, Boy, this is -- this could be dangerous. [Laughter] I'm in China."
00:46:43 - 00:47:14 (30 sec),"I'm in Beijing doing this. And I'm saying, I don't like this. But I looked at him, and I realized -- actually during that speech -- it's not his fault or their fault. It's our fault for allowing that to happen. It's our leaders' fault. [Applause] Over the last 15 years, we've seen a continual decline in the U.S. share of agricultural trade all throughout the world."
00:47:14 - 00:47:30 (16 sec),"You know that. It was all going in the wrong direction. It's changing now. Wait until you see what happens. If we do the right deal with China, you're talking about massive -- they're already backordering, right? They're already back. I told them. I said, You got to start ordering. You're going to order. They're going to order, and they've already started."
00:47:30 - 00:48:05 (35 sec),"We're turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American farmers, ranchers, and, in fact, put America first. That's what I'm interested in: America first. [Applause] We just opened Argentina to American pork exports -- pork -- for the first time in a quarter of a century. They needed something; I said, You have to open it up to pork. And they said, Okay. I said, Why didn't you do it before? They said, Nobody ever asked us. [Laughter] A lot of it is that."
00:48:05 - 00:48:30 (24 sec),"You would be amazed. Nobody ever asks. India and Morocco have both opened their markets to our poultry exports. We do so much for them. It's incredible. Japan opened its market to U.S. exports of potatoes from Idaho -- [Applause] -- and lamb from the great state of Texas, yes. No, they just opened up. We asked them."
00:48:30 - 00:48:51 (22 sec),"We said, You got to open up. Sorry. U.S. beef has been shipped to Brazil for the first time since 2003. They're going to have a great new leader. They say he's the Donald Trump of South America. Do you believe that? [Applause] And he's happy with that. If he wasn't, I wouldn't like the country so much."
00:48:51 - 00:49:21 (30 sec),"But I like him. And we opened China to American beef for the first time in many, many years. We've taken -- [Applause]. You know that. But that was before the trade deal. Don't even worry about it. This is -- that's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. We've taken the toughest-ever actions to confront China's unfair trade practices that hurt American farmers and ranchers."
00:49:21 - 00:49:59 (38 sec),"This includes China's theft of trade secrets from American agri-business. I couldn't believe how complicated your business is -- with the seeds and the genetic farming. It's incredible. People don't know this. But your secrets were being stolen by China, and, in all fairness, other countries. We want a fair deal for American farmers -- removing China's arbitrary bans on agricultural imports, safeguarding our intellectual property, and providing fair market access to all American producers."
00:49:59 - 00:50:35 (36 sec),"We have also made history by finalizing an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the USMCA. A whole different world. A whole different world. [Applause] NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made by a country. It killed our country. This landmark trade deal will increase exports of wheat from Montana, dairy from Wisconsin, chicken from Georgia, and products from farmers and ranchers all across our country."
00:50:35 - 00:51:03 (28 sec),"As part of the USMCA, Canada agreed to give fair treatment to American wheat farmers. They will now grade American wheat just like they grade their own wheat. [Applause] Which, to me, doesn't mean much, but, to farmers, it means a lot. That's what they tell me. I said, What can we do? They said that would be a big thing -- on wheat."
00:51:03 - 00:51:25 (22 sec),"Even the NFL -- you know, the NFL, for many years, was having a hard time with Canada, having to do with the Super Bowl. I heard about it, and I asked about it. And it was a lot of money, but it was tiny compared to the overall deal with Canada and with Mexico. So, as one of the things, I said, You got to treat the NFL fairly. You know, it's a great American company."
00:51:25 - 00:51:45 (20 sec),"And we had the dispute over the National Anthem, and that seems to have worked out properly, which is great, which I give them credit for now. And I said, Listen, when you go to Canada, you're going to ask for this thing because they're not treating our company right. Any company -- I don't care, but that was the NFL."
00:51:45 - 00:52:23 (38 sec),"A big company. A great American company. I said, You're not treating them well. We asked for it; in one minute, we solved a problem that they've been working on for many years. Total success. And they called up, and they thanked me. But it's something that I want to do for American companies. It's easy, it's short, it took a few minutes, and we got it. They were fighting for years."
00:52:23 - 00:52:59 (36 sec),"Canada also agreed to end unfair trade practices that hurt American dairy exports. Also here today are Cris and Gary Peterson, and their son Ben and daughter-in-law Nicki. More than 140 years ago, Gary's great-grandmother began their farm in a tremendous state -- I love this state. Remember when they say, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin? That state hasn't been won by a Republican in so long."
00:52:59 - 00:53:24 (25 sec),"Bill, you don't remember any wins there, right? That was a long time ago. That was even before your time. Right, Bill? A long time. And they said, Donald Trumpâ¦ Remember that? Was that a great evening or what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. [Applause] We love Wisconsin. Today, the Petersons have more than 900 dairy cows."
00:53:24 - 00:53:52 (28 sec),"Like so many of our great farmers, the Petersons have faced a number of threats to their farm and to their entire way of life. For years, NAFTA made it difficult for dairy farmers like the Petersons to export milk, ice cream, cheese, and many other dairy products. Under the USMCA, the Peterson family will finally have the level playing field that they should have had for many years."
00:53:52 - 00:54:17 (25 sec),"They have it now. Together, we urge Congress to support American agriculture, stand up for American workers, and hopefully they will approve the USMCA quite quickly. You know, the one thing I worry about -- it's almost -- no matter how good something is, they might not want to approve it, but they'll approve it. This one -- I think it's going to be very tough for them not."
00:54:17 - 00:54:43 (26 sec),"But I think that -- I hear it's in very good shape. And it replaces something that has been so bad to our country. This is a great deal. As we reverse the damage of decades of unfair trade, we are also providing up to $12 billion in relief to protect our farmers from unfair foreign retaliation. And you saw that recently with Sonny Perdue, where we were helping out during a very unfair period of time when people were actually trying to affect our election."
00:54:43 - 00:55:05 (22 sec),"Nobody brings that up. In this case, it was China. I haven't heard too much about that. Have you heard anything about that? But they were. And we helped our farmers out. No one understands better than our great farmers that the tough choices we make today reap rewards for centuries to come. More than 200 years ago, this very city was at the center of America's negotiations during the legendary Louisiana Purchase."
00:55:05 - 00:55:38 (32 sec),"No one knew how it would all turn out, but President Thomas Jefferson acted decisively for the American people. After months of negotiations, we got what no one ever imagined possible. Not only did we gain New Orleans, we doubled the size of the United States; we secured new parts and ports -- new parts of the map and globe that we never thought, and new ports, very importantly for American agriculture; and we made our nation the greatest farm country on God's Earth."
00:55:38 - 00:56:21 (43 sec),"And it remains that. And it's now, for the first time in a long time, getting better. [Applause] Our nation was founded, settled, and built by farmers. [Applause] From the fields of Pennsylvania to the hills of Tennessee -- [Applause]; from the plains of Missouri -- [Applause] -- to the Big Sky of Montana -- [Applause]; and from the marshes of Florida -- [Applause] -- to the fertile valley of California -- [Applause] -- farmers have always led the way."
00:56:21 - 00:56:58 (37 sec),"[Applause] The American farmer embodies the timeless values of America. You believe in hard work and self-reliance. You follow the rules, obey our laws, and respect our great American flag. [Applause] You support our communities, raise loving families, teach your children right from wrong, and you are always loyal to this magnificent nation that we so love."
00:56:58 - 00:57:30 (32 sec),"Now you have a government that is loyal to you, finally, in return. [Applause] Because we know that government's first duty is to our own citizens. We are fighting for the American farmer, and we are fighting for the American Dream, and for products made and grown with pride right here in the USA. It's what we're fighting for."
00:57:30 - 00:58:00 (30 sec),"[Applause] We are defending a cherished legacy, and we are preserving a beautiful way of life passed down from mothers and fathers to sons and daughters, from generation to generation. You are the keepers of this noble tradition. You are the guardians of this majestic heritage. We are standing up for the men and women who work the fields, till the soil, and harvest the land."
00:58:00 - 00:58:48 (48 sec),"We are protecting your rights, your freedoms, and our glorious Constitution. And we are doing it all with love in our hearts, joy in our souls, and trust in our God. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. To all of the farmers here today and across our country, the greatest harvest is yet to come. The future for America's farmers is bigger, better, bolder, and brighter than ever before."
00:58:48 - 00:59:02 (14 sec),"I just want to thank you all for being here. I'm so honored to have had this kind of a turnout, this kind of a record. I want to thank the American Farm Bureau for the incredible job they do."
00:59:02 - 00:59:26 (24 sec),"I'm proud to be a great friend of the farmer, of the rancher, of the people who so nobly do what you do. God bless you all. God bless our farmers. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. [Applause]"
00:00:00 - 00:00:29 (29 sec),"My fellow Americans. Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country."
00:00:29 - 00:01:02 (33 sec),"America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources, and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl."
00:01:02 - 00:01:40 (38 sec),"Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings."
00:01:40 - 00:02:09 (29 sec),"Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now. This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase."
00:02:09 - 00:02:34 (25 sec),These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims -- by far -- of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.
00:02:34 - 00:03:03 (29 sec),"This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security."
00:03:03 - 00:03:38 (35 sec),"These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission, and keep America safe -- in fact, safer than ever before. The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy."
00:03:38 - 00:04:10 (32 sec),"Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes, so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home. Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier."
00:04:10 - 00:04:44 (35 sec),"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress."
00:04:44 - 00:05:10 (25 sec),"The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They change their mind only after I was elected president."
00:05:10 - 00:05:37 (28 sec),"Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security."
00:05:37 - 00:06:05 (27 sec),My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.
00:06:05 - 00:06:34 (29 sec),"Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security. Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside."
00:06:34 - 00:07:00 (26 sec),The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized. America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border.
00:07:00 - 00:07:28 (27 sec),"The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history."
00:07:28 - 00:08:03 (35 sec),"In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors, were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl. Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration."
00:08:03 - 00:08:48 (45 sec),"I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? For those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered, and totally broken."
00:08:48 - 00:09:20 (32 sec),"To every member of Congress: pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen: call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve."
00:09:20 - 00:09:35 (14 sec),"When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country, and that is what I will always do, so help me God. Thank you, and good night."
00:00:00 - 00:01:27 (87 sec),"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation."
00:01:27 - 00:02:19 (53 sec),"The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican Agenda or a Democrat Agenda. It is the agenda of the American People. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first."
00:02:19 - 00:03:13 (54 sec),"There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the Majesty of America's Mission, and the Power of American Pride."
00:03:13 - 00:03:58 (45 sec),"In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade -- the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6th, 1944, fifteen thousand young American men jumped from the sky and sixty thousand more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny."
00:03:58 - 00:05:21 (83 sec),"Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon."
00:05:21 - 00:06:39 (78 sec),"Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle-class standard of living for the entire world to see."
00:06:39 - 00:07:58 (80 sec),"Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this Great American Adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our Middle Class bigger and more prosperous than ever before."
00:07:58 - 00:08:50 (52 sec),"But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future."
00:08:50 - 00:09:41 (51 sec),"The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades."
00:09:41 - 00:10:12 (30 sec),"In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom -- a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started."
00:10:12 - 00:10:49 (37 sec),"Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
00:10:49 - 00:12:42 (113 sec),"Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history -- 157 million."
00:12:42 - 00:13:57 (75 sec),"We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty â and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try."
00:13:57 - 00:14:58 (61 sec),My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American Energy -- the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.
00:14:58 - 00:16:59 (121 sec),"And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is Strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before."
00:16:59 - 00:18:06 (67 sec),"On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone -- almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation."
00:18:06 - 00:19:02 (56 sec),"It just doesn't work that way. We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate -- some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country."
00:19:02 - 00:20:05 (63 sec),"Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans."
00:20:05 - 00:20:59 (55 sec),"And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking Criminal Justice Reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path."
00:20:59 - 00:21:58 (59 sec),"She had a big impact on that prison population -- and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing -- and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice's sentence -- when I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing -- Alice is here with us tonight."
00:21:58 - 00:23:20 (82 sec),"Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. Inspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community."
00:23:20 - 00:23:59 (39 sec),"The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, states across the country are following our lead. America is a nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses."
00:23:59 - 00:25:10 (71 sec),"Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of All Americans: welcome home. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis."
00:25:10 - 00:26:06 (56 sec),"Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our Southern Border. Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business."
00:26:06 - 00:26:46 (40 sec),"As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our Southern Border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught."
00:26:46 - 00:27:21 (35 sec),"This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our Southern Border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws."
00:27:21 - 00:28:33 (72 sec),"Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration."
00:28:33 - 00:29:24 (51 sec),"Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."
00:29:24 - 00:30:20 (57 sec),Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel. 1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
00:30:20 - 00:31:06 (45 sec),"Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our Southern Border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City."
00:31:06 - 00:31:42 (36 sec),"We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads and families -- no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured."
00:31:42 - 00:32:26 (44 sec),"Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison."
00:32:26 - 00:33:44 (78 sec),"To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings."
00:33:44 - 00:34:39 (55 sec),"We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking."
00:34:39 - 00:36:19 (101 sec),"Elvin says: ""If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job."" Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars. Special Agent Hernandez please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement -- and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our Southern Border."
00:36:19 - 00:37:11 (52 sec),"It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall."
00:37:11 - 00:38:01 (50 sec),"It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings."
00:38:01 - 00:39:13 (72 sec),"The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime -- one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe."
00:39:13 - 00:42:02 (169 sec),"As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before -- and exactly one century after Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than ever before."
00:42:02 - 00:42:37 (35 sec),"As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount -- reversing decades of calamitous trade policies."
00:42:37 - 00:43:21 (43 sec),"We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion dollars of Chinese goods -- and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars."
00:43:21 - 00:44:09 (49 sec),"But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us -- I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs."
00:44:09 - 00:44:41 (31 sec),"Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried -- until now."
00:44:41 - 00:46:17 (97 sec),"Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- or USMCA -- will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure."
00:46:17 - 00:47:32 (75 sec),"I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill -- and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs -- and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions."
00:47:32 - 00:48:35 (63 sec),"Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American Patients."
00:48:35 - 00:49:59 (84 sec),"We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American Freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach."
00:49:59 - 00:51:06 (67 sec),"My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Tonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer."
00:51:06 - 00:52:06 (60 sec),"Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10 year old girl, Grace Ee-line. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer."
00:52:06 - 00:53:00 (54 sec),"Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 dollars for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: ""Last day of Keemo."" Grace -- you are an inspiration to us all."
00:53:00 - 00:54:20 (80 sec),"Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask Congress for $500 million dollars over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child."
00:54:20 - 00:55:03 (43 sec),There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth.
00:55:03 - 00:56:01 (58 sec),"These are living, feeling, beautiful, babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb."
00:56:01 - 00:57:08 (67 sec),"Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security. Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military -- with $700 billion dollars last year and $716 billion dollars this year."
00:57:08 - 00:58:19 (71 sec),"We are also getting other nationsto pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO -- but now we have secured a $100 billion dollar increase in defense spending from NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System."
00:58:19 - 00:58:54 (36 sec),"Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms."
00:58:54 - 01:00:03 (69 sec),"That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't -- in which case,we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula."
01:00:03 - 01:00:41 (38 sec),"Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one."
01:00:41 - 01:01:50 (69 sec),"Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Gwydo. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom -- and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair."
01:01:50 - 01:02:36 (46 sec),"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence -- not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
01:02:36 - 01:03:32 (57 sec),"One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism -- not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel -- and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem."
01:03:32 - 01:04:28 (55 sec),"Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American Heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion dollars in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach."
01:04:28 - 01:05:31 (63 sec),"Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home."
01:05:31 - 01:06:37 (66 sec),"I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor -- and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban."
01:06:37 - 01:07:32 (55 sec),"As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people."
01:07:32 - 01:08:23 (51 sec),"18 years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole -- and last month American Forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole."
01:08:23 - 01:09:33 (70 sec),"My administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country."
01:09:33 - 01:10:33 (60 sec),"We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants Death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish People. We must never ignore the vile poison of Anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an Anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh."
01:10:33 - 01:12:02 (88 sec),SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery -- but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.
01:12:02 - 01:13:56 (114 sec),"He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall -- more than 7 decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp."
01:13:56 - 01:15:03 (67 sec),"Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: ""It's the Americans."" A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau [Dah-kow] Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks."
01:15:03 - 01:16:26 (83 sec),"To me, Joshua recalls, ""the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky."" I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchick. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the Beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American Soldiers who helped liberate Dachau [Dah-kow]. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth."
01:16:26 - 01:17:47 (81 sec),"Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight -- seated side-by-side, here in the home of American Freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation. Very much appreciated. Thank you very much. Thank you. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war."
01:17:47 - 01:18:44 (57 sec),"They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America -- they did it for us. Everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before."
01:18:44 - 01:19:41 (57 sec),"Think of this Capitol -- think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure Civil Rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent Republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California."
01:19:41 - 01:20:24 (43 sec),"Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come."
01:20:24 - 01:21:00 (35 sec),We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our inheritance -- or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.
01:21:00 - 01:21:37 (38 sec),"This is the time to re-ignite the American Imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future -- our fate -- and our choice to make."
01:21:37 - 01:22:24 (47 sec),"I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep Freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's Destiny -- that One Nation, Under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world."
01:22:24 - 01:22:45 (21 sec),"Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and Goodnight."
00:00:00 - 00:00:26 (27 sec),"Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, Kevin. Do we love Kevin? Wow, what a job. What a job. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Where is Kevin sitting? He's around here someplace. Kevin, Thank you. Collects so much money. What do you say $23 -- $23 million? That's not bad. I mean, you are the minority, I hate to say."
00:00:26 - 00:00:48 (22 sec),"That's not going to last long, I don't think. That's not going to last long. It was just a brief little spell. You wanted to take a little break. You shouldn't have done it. I told you that. Don't worry, they blame me. I say, ""What the hell did I have to do with it?"" They said, ""Trump wasn't running."" But you know what?"
00:00:48 - 00:01:13 (25 sec),"We're going to do great. I really believe it. We're going to do great. We're going to take the House back. We are. I feel totally confident about that. We're going to watch those vote tallies. You know, I keep hearing about the election and the -- the various counting measures that they have. There were a lot of close elections that were -- they seemed to, every single one of them went Democrat."
00:01:13 - 00:01:35 (21 sec),"If it was close they say, ""The Democrat -- "" Well, there's something going on -- you got to -- hey, you got to be a little bit more paranoid than you are. Okay. Look, all these beautiful people. These beautiful Republican congressmen and women. But we have to be a little bit careful because I don't like the way the votes are being tallied."
00:01:35 - 00:02:07 (32 sec),"I don't like it and you don't like it either. You just don't want to say it because you're afraid of the press. You're afraid of the press. But we have to be careful. And I have to tell you, though, that this is my third one of these and this is really something. It's thrilling to be here tonight with my many great friends and fellow patriots to support incredible Republican members of Congress -- and you are incredible and you've gone through a lot and you're tougher and stronger than ever."
00:02:07 - 00:02:30 (23 sec),"And I'll tell you, I have never been more unified with you than I am right now for some reason. I don't know what it is. It's true. You helped us on the border, which turned out that you're right on that one. That was when it was a little bit less in vogue than it is today. Now everybody's saying, ""I told you there was an emergency."" But you were there right from the beginning."
00:02:30 - 00:02:49 (18 sec),"I appreciate it. I -- I really mean it. I don't think I've ever been closer to you folks, the people in this room, than I am right now, more so than I was even a year ago -- and it was pretty good then, too. But you're fighting every day for our citizens, our safety, our rights, and our God given freedom."
00:02:49 - 00:03:15 (26 sec),"I especially want to thank the rest of this terrific House Republican leadership team, including Republican Whip, the bravest man in this room, a man who played second base in a game where a shot was hit to him. He had zero range. You know, the Yankees had a guy Bobby Richardson, they say he had the widest range of anybody."
00:03:15 - 00:03:41 (26 sec),"He could get a ball anywhere. Go back to shortstop. He was a second baseman. He had the greatest range of everybody. Steve Scalise had the least range of anybody in the history of second base. And I watched that game and I said, ""Oh, my God, look,"" a shot was hit to second. It was hit hard. A really hard ground ball and he got down, he blocked that sucker."
00:03:41 - 00:04:04 (23 sec),"He then picked it up and he threw it to first. I said, ""Is this a movie we're watching?"" The first pitch and Steve Scalise. And let me tell you, Steve Scalise has courage. I was with him that night and his incredible family, his wife, and he wasn't looking so good. And in a short while -- and the doctor said he wasn't looking so good."
00:04:04 - 00:04:45 (41 sec),"It wasn't such a great prognosis. And I'll tell you what, he fights better than anybody and he's my friend and he's your friend. Steve's Scalise. Where is Steve? Where is Steve? Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Steve. Great guy. I'm glad you're on our side, Steve. Okay. And thank you very much and congratulations and to your family."
00:04:45 - 00:05:13 (28 sec),"Amazing what's happened with you. A person who is tough and smart and somebody that fought very hard, loyal. I did something for a man named Scooter Libby, who was not treated fairly in the eyes of many. I've heard this for many years, was not treated fairly. And Liz and her father -- and they came out early for me. Actually, her father came out like almost immediately for me, and it was interesting because I didn't know him."
00:05:13 - 00:05:29 (16 sec),"I liked him, I respected him, but I didn't know him really. But he came out very early. It was a very important moment, actually, for me because who the hell was supporting me? Everyone thought I was just playing games, right? They said, ""He doesn't really mean this. He's just having fun."" You call this fun?"
00:05:29 - 00:05:55 (26 sec),"It's fun. You get phony witch hunts and you get all the others. This is a lot of fun, folks. Have a good time. ""Have a good time, Donald,"" as I wave goodbye to Fifth Avenue. Great time. But I am having a great time because we're doing a lot. We're doing more than anyone's ever done in a short period of time."
00:05:55 - 00:06:21 (26 sec),"We're doing it together. And I am having a good time -- because we're producing for people. But Liz Cheney was so dedicated and -- and the loyalty. That was just an honor for me to do it because we want to take care of our people that got hurt, our people that got wounded. They got wounded. Just like Steve got wounded."
00:06:21 - 00:06:44 (24 sec),"This was a different kind of a wound. And we took care of them. And she was so happy and her father was so happy because they don't forget. Those are good people. So, Liz, thank you very much. Where is Liz? Where is Liz? Thank you, Liz. I mean that, too. Dedicated. It's called loyal people. We like loyal people."
00:06:44 - 00:07:06 (21 sec),"And our -- and our NRCC chair, Tom Emmer. Tom. Thank you, Tom. Great job. I watched him speaking from back, they have a beautiful camera setup and I looked at my people I said, ""This guy's like central casting."" You couldn't pick a better guy in Hollywood. There's no actor that could do it better. Really, thank you, Tom."
00:07:06 - 00:07:28 (22 sec),"Thank you for the great job more importantly. And a special thanks to the chair of this evening's dinner -- and I've agreed to go to the Caterpillar place where they make those beautiful D10s. I said, ""Are they making the D12 yet?"" ""No, they make that in a different location."" I said, ""Well, Darin, I want to go there then."
00:07:28 - 00:08:04 (37 sec),"I want to see what a D12 looks like."" But we're going, no, we're going to Caterpillar. We'll be there soon. And that's a great company and Darin LaHood does a fantastic job of representing that area. They love him. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be there with Darin. I'll be there. Finally, to all of our wonderful supporters here tonight who pour your time, your energy, your resources, and your heart into defending our great nation, your commitment has never been more important than it is right now and we thank you."
00:08:04 - 00:08:26 (21 sec),"And we are, all together, putting America First. Something you haven't heard for many, many decades, America First. We're putting America First. That's what we're doing. And you see that in our deal with China. you're going to see that in a lot of different things. They're all coming online right now. You're seeing it in a lot of different ways."
00:08:26 - 00:08:47 (22 sec),"It's amazing. You know, we ran on a theme, ""Make America Great Again"". And a lot of people are saying that may have been the greatest theme ever in politics. I think it is that. And it wasn't -- Ronald Reagan had a small thing called, ""Let's Make America Great"". That was good. I don't like it as much. And he sure as hell didn't use it as much."
00:08:47 - 00:09:08 (20 sec),"We had -- we've sold millions and millions of hats. Now you go to a rally everybody has the red hat ""Make America Great Again"". Maybe I can have a little help from you. So we have to make a decision pretty soon because we've done a lot for the country. The stock market's up almost 50 percent. We've gotten rid of the great regulations."
00:09:08 - 00:09:34 (26 sec),"Kevin and everybody have told you -- and the great tax cuts with the legendary Kevin Brady and his group. And we've done all of these things. Where is Kevin? I was actually going to introduce him later, but I'll introduce him right now. Where's Kevin? Thank you, Kevin. What a job this man's done. What a job he's done."
00:09:34 - 00:09:58 (25 sec),"Thank you, Kevin. You really have. But we have to make a decision -- the theme for the next campaign. So we've been here by that time three, three and a half years, we're going into the war with some socialists. And it looks like the only non-sort of heavy Socialist he's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists."
00:09:58 - 00:10:23 (25 sec),"They got to him. Our former vice president. He's -- I was going to call him, I don't know him well, I was going to say, ""Welcome to the world, Joe. Are you having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?"" But we're going to be running against somebody that's going to go as far left as possible. They're going to go out there."
00:10:23 - 00:10:48 (25 sec),"And so we have to come up -- do we say it seriously, let me know, do we say, ""Keep America Great?"" My theme was going to be ""Keep America Great"" because we've made it great. And we really have. I mean, we -- China is down 38 percent, Kevin, because of tariffs, okay. See, look at Kevin. You're not unhappy about that."
00:10:48 - 00:11:10 (22 sec),"And we're up 50 percent. And the world is not doing well. Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing well. But we're doing well. We're setting records. We should have another record very shortly in the stock market. I think we have 22 Records, 22, where the stock market hit new highs, 22, 100 percent hours."
00:11:10 - 00:11:26 (16 sec),"We have everyone, 22. And now we're going to have another one it looks like. It was looking a little bit bleaker two or three months ago, but that was artificial, it was artificially caused. But it looks like we're going to have some more. We're going to have a lot more. But I have to decide, do we make a change in the theme?"
00:11:26 - 00:12:00 (34 sec),"So you'll tell me because you'll clap. So we have the greatest theme, I think, really of all time, ""Make America Great Again. ""MAGA"". ""MAGA"". ""MAGA Country"", right? MAGA County. How about the guy from Chicago? The actor that nobody ever heard of, nobody ever -- I said, ""Who the hell is that?"" He said, ""He got taken out by MAGA Country."" I said, ""What the hell was that?"" I guess that's a hate crime, right?"
00:12:00 - 00:12:25 (26 sec),"He got taken out by MAGA Country. But we have ""MAGA"" and we do have ""MAGA Country"". We have people that are so in love with us. We have the greatest base, I believe, in the history of politics or I wouldn't be here. With all the things I've done they never wavered. They never wavered. Can you believe? Anybody else they'd be down to 2 percent right now, and we just had our best -- we just had 51 percent and 54 percent."
00:12:25 - 00:12:57 (31 sec),"And they say you can add 10 percent -- because 10 percent of the people love us, but they're ashamed to say, ""That I'm voting for the president."" I don't care, they're ashamed. And I said, ""Am I supposed to like that?"" I do. We'll take it any way we can get it, right, fellas? Anyway, we can get it. Actually in the one poll, and we have some great pollsters unless it work for CNN, that -- those are -- that's fake news."
00:12:57 - 00:13:24 (27 sec),"You know, polls can be fake news, too. But we have one poll where the pollster said, ""Anybody that says, 'I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to tell you. I don't want to even discuss it -- '"" And they also added another two words, when they call up and they say these two horrible words -- anybody in that category it's a 100 percent vote for Trump."
00:13:24 - 00:13:45 (21 sec),"And what they've done is they don't count that. But now this one counts that, it's 100 percent. We're going to have a great election. The question is, do I go with ""Make America Great Again"" or do I go with ""Keep America Great"" because we made it great in theory. So are you ready? Let's go. Let me hear it. And -- and it is hard."
00:13:45 - 00:14:04 (18 sec),"You know, I was seeing the other day, they were saying it's -- it's probably the greatest theme in the history of politics. I think it is, ""Make America Great Again, MAGA"". How do you give that up for a new one? ""KAG"". ""KAG"". ""Keep America Great. KAG"". I don't know. Maybe it catches on. You never know. You know what?"
00:14:04 - 00:14:42 (38 sec),"First with MAGA I never thought MAGA was going to catch on. And now MAGA, everything's MAGA. I even say just whenever I do a tweet, that's -- boy that has kept us in business, those tweets, huh? Haven't they? It's my only form of defense because the press is 94 percent against us, 94 percent. So, who likes ""Make America Great Again""? And you people are pros, most of you, not all of you."
00:14:42 - 00:15:25 (43 sec),"I see a couple of people I know they have not done well in this business. In fact, they're sitting outside of those doors trying to get in. Who likes ""Keep America Great""? Okay, so ready? ""Make America Great Again"". Or ""Keep America Great"". I don't know. It's -- it's, honestly, I love the idea of ""Keep America Great"" because you know what it says is we've made it great now we're going to keep it great because the Socialists will destroy it. You know, we're doing great but they can destroy what we've done with the steel industry."
00:15:25 - 00:15:49 (24 sec),"Look at what's going on with the steel industry in your district, also, by the way, along with Caterpillar, they're building steel mills, 38 steel mills all over the land, renovation and -- and a lot of new ones. A lot of new ones. Because we decided to put the tariffs on dumped steel, mostly from China, what it's done is beyond anybody's -- it's like one of the hot -- hot things."
00:15:49 - 00:16:06 (17 sec),"And by the way, this country needs steel. We've got to have steel. You know, there are certain things you don't have to have, like, you know, making the suit, you don't have to have, you have to have steel. We need it for defense. You have to have aluminum. And it's incredible what happened to those industries."
00:16:06 - 00:16:26 (20 sec),"So we will make the determination. And honestly, I get a good vibe on both, to be honest. I love the concept. We made it great and now we're going to keep it great, but I hate the concept of throwing away the most successful theme, I think, probably in the history politics. I mean, there's something a little stupid about that, right?"
00:16:26 - 00:16:48 (22 sec),"Let's take MAGA and throw it out. So I have a feeling we maybe we'll try and use both. How about that? We'll try and use both because they're both good. You know. Hillary had a thing like ""Stay Together"" or some crap like that. I think she paid $1.9 million for the genius that gave her the line. I can honestly tell you I didn't pay."
00:16:48 - 00:17:11 (23 sec),"That was made up by me. That was made up by me. But they paid a lot of money. And then the first night, remember, we said, ""It's all about her,"" and then changed the theme the next morning. So that didn't work out too well. Her theme wasn't too good. It wasn't a success. But after two years of Republican leadership, and -- and I have to tell you, we are truly winning again."
00:17:11 - 00:17:35 (24 sec),"Our country is winning again and our country is respected again. And it's, I say, respected like rarely before and we're hitting a new mark. But I say it's respected like rarely before. And with your help, we're restoring the bonds of loyalty and trust between our citizens and their government and we're returning power to where it belongs, with the American people."
00:17:35 - 00:18:09 (35 sec),"To liberate our citizens from bureaucracy we've slashed almost 30,000 pages of job killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record no matter how long a president was in office. Let me see what I look like, huh? Good. I don't see much of a bald spot there. I'm very -- I'm always afraid to look in those cameras."
00:18:09 - 00:18:30 (21 sec),"And again, I want to thank -- and -- and he is a special man. He's a friend of mine, but -- And I introduced him a little earlier, but I'm going to introduce them again because Kevin Brady, and so many of the other fantastic Republicans that passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country and they're for the working families."
00:18:30 - 00:18:52 (22 sec),"We don't get credit for the working families part, but it's the largest tax cuts. And businesses are flowing back into our country because of those tax cuts and because of regulation cuts. So Kevin, again, thank you very much. Really an incredible job. Thank you to everybody that worked with all of us, you know that right?"
00:18:52 - 00:19:14 (22 sec),"We doubled the Child Tax Credit and we virtually ended the unfair Estate Tax, also known as the Death Tax on small businesses and farms. I tell people when I'm in farm country, I said, ""You know, now if you have a farm -- ,"" they used to leave it and the kids would have to go out and borrow a lot of money because they make an income but it's hard."
00:19:14 - 00:19:33 (19 sec),The land is sometimes worth more than the income. And they go borrow money at the end up losing it to a bank a couple of years later. It's -- -not going to be worried about any longer. Now they don't have the Death Tax. They don't have what's known as the Estate Tax. We got rid of it. Kevin did that with a whole group of very good people.
00:19:33 - 00:19:57 (24 sec),"And that's a big deal. That's a big deal. People are very happy. I always say, jokingly, ""So now if you love your children you can leave your farm or your small business to your children and they don't have to go borrow money and take a risk. If you don't leave your children -- if you don't love them, if you don't just really love them it doesn't matter because you're not going to leave it to them anyway."
00:19:57 - 00:20:22 (25 sec),"So this tax doesn't mean a damn thing. This tax won't help you much."" But most of them leave it to their children, I guess. To bring back American jobs we slashed the business tax rate down from one of the highest anywhere in the developed world, down to a number that nobody believed that we could get down to. We were at, if you really add it up, we were over 40 percent."
00:20:22 - 00:20:46 (25 sec),"It was an impossible situation. And you know, so many things are in that deal like bringing back money. Billions and billions of dollars is pouring back into a country that could not get back here. It was impossible, not only because of the high tax rates, nobody would bring it back -- over 40 percent, but also because of the bureaucracy which we killed in our tax plan."
00:20:46 - 00:21:10 (24 sec),"So billions of dollars. Apple recently announced $230 billion is going to be brought back into our country from overseas that they would never have even thought of bringing back and they're going to spend it building new facilities here. That's a lot, $230 billion. And we're fixing broken trade deals to protect the American workers."
00:21:10 - 00:21:29 (19 sec),"And we are standing up to China's chronic trading abuses and theft of intellectual properties and so many other things that they've done to us. I don't know how you people allowed this to happen for so many years. You've been here longer than me. But they really have, they've taken advantage of our country."
00:21:29 - 00:21:49 (20 sec),"And you know what? I respect them for it. I say it. We should have been doing that to them. I was in China making a speech. President Xi, who is a strong man, I call him King, he said, ""But I am not King, I am president."" I said, ""No, you're president for life and therefore, you're King."" He said, ""Huh. Huh."" He liked that."
00:21:49 - 00:22:11 (22 sec),"So I call him King. I get along with them great. But I was really hitting him hard about how they've hurt our country. And I had 5,000 Chinese people, I'm China, I'm in Beijing doing this, can you believe it? And I'm looking down, he's getting angrier and angrier. And then I saved it. I said, ""You know, I don't blame you."
00:22:11 - 00:22:38 (27 sec),"I blame the leaders of our country for allowing it to happen."" And it's really true. We should never have allowed that to happen. And we're getting a lot of it back. You're going to see it. And your farmers, all of you representing farm territory -- You know, I was with the Vice Premier about two weeks ago, and I said, ""You got to do me a favor of goodwill,"" because we have such a strong country right now, economically, stronger than anybody by far."
00:22:38 - 00:22:55 (17 sec),"You know, they were catching us. They would have -- they would have caught us within a short period of time. They we're catching us. Within two years, by the end of my term, if you had a normal president, I don't want to say that negatively, I think I'm very normal, but if you had a normal -- you know what I mean."
00:22:55 - 00:23:16 (21 sec),"In other words, if you had a stiff as president -- which most of them are, I hate to say -- they would have caught us. But right now it's going to be a long time before they catch us. A long time. I told you, they're down 38 percent, we're up 50 percent. That made a lot of difference. It's like day and night."
00:23:16 - 00:23:44 (28 sec),"But we really have to be strong with these nations because these nations are taking advantage, not just China, everybody has a trade surplus on us -- almost every nation in the world. When I took over we lost eight -- I said, ""How are we doing on trade? I want to break down,"" my first meeting. They said, ""Sir, we're down $807 billion."" I said, ""You got to be kidding?"" No, seriously, I thought they were joking, right?"
00:23:44 - 00:24:08 (24 sec),"We were down $807. We're losing over $800 billion in trade. We're starting to turn it. We have the USMCA. I hope you guys can get it approved. I mean, the problem we have -- is that you have a very hostile group. You have a very, very hostile group on the other side, and they don't want to see us have success and the USMCA is a great deal."
00:24:08 - 00:24:30 (22 sec),"It's great. Again, I said, ""If you don't do this we're going to tariff every product coming out of your country at 25 percent."" And every time I had a problem I would just take -- you know, especially cars. I had a little plastic car on my desk and I'd have the leaders come over and I just take the car out, put it on the front of the desk, they say, ""Okay, we agree."" Because the big thing is the cars."
00:24:30 - 00:24:55 (25 sec),"Canada's sending us tremendous numbers of cars. They're practically un-taxed, and yet they don't take our agricultural product, in many cases, and in many cases they charge 297 percent tariffs and it's very unfair. Canada's very, very tough. You know, we love Canada. We think of the beautiful song and the ice hockey games, Oh, Canada, isn't it beautiful?"
00:24:55 - 00:25:23 (28 sec),"But in the meantime, they knock the hell out of us on trade and they have been doing it for a long time. And they're very tough. And they're not at all nice about that situation. But we've made them nice. We've made them nice. And they're not happy about what happened. But our farmers are going to be able to sell now into Canada, which they were restricted from doing and -- and they're going to be able to sell into a lot of places."
00:25:23 - 00:25:50 (27 sec),"And the Vice Premier said when I said, ""Give us a token of affection."" He said, ""We will immediately by 10 million tons of soybeans."" And I looked at Sonny Perdue, who's doing a fantastic job, as you know, Secretary of Agriculture -- I said, ""Sonny, is 10 million tons of soybeans a lot? It sounds -- "" He said, ""That's a lot."" And they started buying 10 million."
00:25:50 - 00:26:22 (32 sec),"So the farmers are so incredible -- and I saw them interviewed last week. They had a couple of farmers on. We love the farmers. I'll tell you. I'm never going to forget the farmers. They -- they sort of got me here, wouldn't you think? And they said, ""Well, you know -- "" because China and various of these countries that were rightfully doing numbers on them because we have no choice what they've done to us. But they're going to start buying at numbers that you've never seen before."
00:26:22 - 00:26:43 (21 sec),"But farmers said, ""We know how badly China has taken advantage of this country. And we may be getting a little bit hurt right now but we're with the president all the way."" They have every single farmer, every person I've seen they have these focus groups, every farmer has said the same thing. And you know, the amazing thing about farmers?"
00:26:43 - 00:27:08 (25 sec),"We had a little bit of a soft patch and I called in a group of 15 or 20 representative farmers and I wanted to give them help, I wanted to give them aid. And they looked at me and said, ""We don't want aid. We don't want it."" And I said, ""What do you mean?"" Because I'm so used to having people come in, wanting help, wanting aid, wanting whatever it is they want."
00:27:08 - 00:27:30 (21 sec),"And these people didn't want it. They just wanted me to make a fair platform. And I said, ""I'll never forget this meeting. I will never forget it,"" because again, I meet with a lot of different groups and they're always asking for an advantage. Okay, I'm not blaming anybody. These farmers didn't want it. They said, ""We don't want that, sir."
00:27:30 - 00:27:51 (22 sec),"We don't want any help. We just want a -- really a level playing field."" I thought it was incredible. I've told that story so many times. So we love our farmers. Let them know we're very close, because you are going to have -- In fact, when I asked China -- and I'm doing that, that'll be the end of the -- if we get there and you know, let's see what happens."
00:27:51 - 00:28:14 (22 sec),"Who knows? I think we're doing very well. They need the deal more than we do. You see what's -- they need the deal. And they getting hurt badly with the -- you know, they're paying 25 percent on $50 billion worth of technology stuff and they were going to pay 25 percent on another $200 billion. But I started them at $10 because I'm nice."
00:28:14 - 00:28:52 (38 sec),"And then we were dealing well, this was three, four weeks ago. You remember. And they said, ""Would it be possible for you not to raise the 10 percent to 25 percent?"" which would automatically kick in? I said, ""Yes,"" because you know it's a little hard to negotiate with them when we start raising it. But after that, they have $340 billion left that I haven't even text and their bullets are gone because we do $600 billion worth of purchases from them, and they do $97 billion worth of purchases from us. Not exactly great."
00:28:52 - 00:29:16 (25 sec),"But now they were paying for that. And they were paying big. One thing, as an example, on cars, if they sold a car to us we bring it in for no tax. It's 2.5 percent, but basically, when you do certain paperwork and check the wrong boxes you pay nothing. It's stupid. When we buy a car from them, and we buy a lot of them, believe it or not, it's a 40 percent tax."
00:29:16 - 00:29:34 (18 sec),"So they get 40 percent, we get nothing, other than that it's been a very good deal. I get a call two months ago, toward the beginning of the negotiation, that they're bringing the 40 percent down to 15 percent. I said, ""That's good, but it's still not zero. It's still not what we have."" You know, it's good."
00:29:34 - 00:29:54 (20 sec),"I'm not thrilled. I got a call from -- and but that's coming down. It's all coming down. I got a call from Prime Minister Modi of India. They're one of the highest taxing nations in the world. They taxed us 100 percent. Look, he's nodding, you know what I'm talking about. They charge us 100 percent tariffs on goods."
00:29:54 - 00:30:20 (26 sec),"So they send a motorcycle -- and they make a lot of them -- Indian cycles. They send them to our country, we charge them nothing. We send a Harley Davidson to India and they charge us 100 percent. Not fair, okay. Not reciprocal. It's not fair. And for those of you, like Sean, and like -- where's Sean? Where the hell is my guy from Wisconsin?"
00:30:20 - 00:30:56 (37 sec),"He's so great. Where is he? This guy's a champion. Him and where's Jim? 128 -- 128 and 1. Where the hell is Jim Jordan? Where the hell is he? Is he here? 128. Where is he? This guy, NCAA, What a lousy location. Holy -- are you kidding me? Wait, stand up again. I can't see you. It's too far away. I can't believe it. Wow, Jim, I've just lost all respect for Jim."
00:30:56 - 00:31:17 (20 sec),"That's it. One hundred twenty eight and one in wrestling, NCAA Wrestling Champion. And you know when you're that -- when you're that good, don't kid yourself, folks. A lot of us up here, not just here, a lot of it's right up here. And he's a warrior and Sean's a warrior. And Sean now is working on the Reciprocal Trade Act."
00:31:17 - 00:31:40 (23 sec),"If they charge us, we charge them, very simple. They charge us, we charge them. And I think you're doing great on it, Sean, and I appreciate it, man. Great job. But he's the tree climbing, you know, these characters to go up the trees then they come down. He said, ""No, going up isn't the hard part, it's coming down because if you miss you're dead."" And he said he's missed about four times."
00:31:40 - 00:32:04 (25 sec),"But he's a five time world champion going up a tree. Did anybody know that? See, to me that means something because being a champion is something -- And that's one that is tough stuff and dangerous stuff. So listen, I appreciate your help, Sean. It's incredible. That's incredible. I'm still more impressed with a championship stuff, but that's -- So we've ended the war on American energy."
00:32:04 - 00:32:31 (26 sec),"The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And that all happened over the last two years. Big difference. Hillary wanted to put up wind. Wind. If you -- if you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value."
00:32:31 - 00:32:55 (25 sec),"And they say the noise causes cancer. You told me that one. Okay. You know, the thing makes it -- it's so -- And of course, it's like a graveyard for birds. If you love birds you'd never want to walk under a windmill because it's a very sad, sad sight. It's like a cemetery. We put a little -- we put a little statue for the poor birds."
00:32:55 - 00:33:25 (30 sec),"It's true. You know, in California, if you shoot a Bald Eagle they put you in jail for five years and yet, the windmills wipe them all out. It's true. They wipe them out. It's terrible. And I told the other day at CPAC, great people at CPAC. We had an incredible thing. I had nothing to do. It was early on a Saturday morning I had just gotten back from dealing with Kim Jong-un. We had to walk."
00:33:25 - 00:33:42 (17 sec),"He wasn't ready for deal. That's okay, because we get along great. He wasn't ready. I told him, ""You're not ready for a deal."" That's the first time anybody has ever told him that and left. It's never happened to him before. Nobody's ever left. But I said, ""You're not ready for a deal, but we'll make it deal."" We have a good relationship."
00:33:42 - 00:34:09 (27 sec),"We have a good relationship. But I told a story about CPAC, the woman, she wants to watch television and she says to her husband, ""Is the wind blowing? I'd love to watch your show tonight, darling. The wind hasn't blown for three days. I can't watch television, darling. Darling, please tell the wind to blow."" No, wind's not so good."
00:34:09 - 00:34:25 (16 sec),"And you know, you have no idea how expensive it is to make those things. They're all made in China and Germany, by the way, just in case you -- We don't make them here, essentially. We don't make them here. And by the way, the carbon and all of the things flying up in the air, you know, the carbon footprint?"
00:34:25 - 00:34:54 (29 sec),"President Obama used to talk about the carbon footprint and he'd hop on Air Force One, a big 747 with very old engines, and he'd fly to Hawaii to play a round of golf. Now, you tell me, the carbon footprint. But that's the way it is. We have the greatest energy in the world. They wanted to take it away from us. They don't like that we have it. We've really discovered it over the last very short period of time."
00:34:54 - 00:35:15 (21 sec),"I've made it readily accessible. We're approving pipelines in Texas that would have taken 20 years. I'm getting them done in about six months. You guys all know that the Texas guys. And by the way, if they're not good, if there's something wrong, if it's going to hurt our water, if it's going to hurt our air, if it's going to -- we're not going to approve them."
00:35:15 - 00:35:34 (19 sec),"But you're going to know in 12 months instead of in 20 years, at the end of 20 years you start off as a young man or woman and now you're getting ready to retire and they're getting ready to vote on your project, right, whatever the hell it may be. You know, highways, Elaine Chao is doing a great job, by the way, as our Secretary."
00:35:34 - 00:35:56 (22 sec),"Great job. But highways, in many cases, would take 20 or 21 years to get approved. Think of it. In some cases, not even a highway, it's like a roadway. And I have a down now to two years. We got rid of so much of the waste and the stupidity. And you know, a lot of this happened because of consultants, environmental engineers, they call themselves."
00:35:56 - 00:36:17 (22 sec),"I have -- I've heard many of them. I've lost plenty of money with those guys. And I used to see him up at Albany. I'd say, ""How come you're here? Why are you here? You represent me. Why are you here?"" They're trying to get a bill passed that makes it harder to get permits and my guy is there trying to get the bill because I have to pay them more money that way, my consultant."
00:36:17 - 00:36:47 (30 sec),"So we took down highways from, in many cases 20 years, till probably -- we want to get it down to one year and then maybe get rejected but you'll get it rejected quickly. You're going to know. It's like Jack Nicklaus is a friend of mine. He said standing over a four foot putt, he never missed them, but he told me Chichi Rodriguez, great putter, he get up, he was a character and he'd just putt."
00:36:47 - 00:37:06 (19 sec),"Get up, bing. Get up, bing. It wouldn't take any time. Get up, bing. He had an expression, ""Miss it quick."" You ever hear that expression? He was a character. ""Miss it quick."" I'd get up, ""Miss it quick."" But he didn't miss too many. But that's what we're doing. We're going to make sure that you get it and if it doesn't work we're going to let you know."
00:37:06 - 00:37:36 (30 sec),"There was a highway, a small highway in a state where some friends are in this room. It is 21 years. It was going to cost $5 million 21 years ago. Now it's going to cost $900 million and it took 21 years to get it approved. And it used to be a straight line. Right? So if somebody's a little tipsy, they had too many drinks, which is a bad thing, at least they could drive straight."
00:37:36 - 00:38:03 (27 sec),"Now in order to get away from nesting turtles, rattlesnakes, and everything else, that highway is the craziest looking sucker you've ever seen. It's twice as long as it was supposed to be. My father and I would have designed it a straight path, point to point, right? And but it took -- and it cost, you know, I mean, literally, almost hundreds of times more than it was supposed to cost."
00:38:03 - 00:38:24 (20 sec),"And it's dangerous. People are running into the -- they don't know how, but they're running into things that they're not supposed to. So we're straightening things out. There are many, many stories like that. The great aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, I go to see it and the catapult system, you know, the catapult, that's what's throws the plane off."
00:38:24 - 00:38:47 (23 sec),"So the aircraft carrier, there's a slight problem. It was supposed to cost $3 billion. It ended up costing about $16 billion right now. It wasn't on my watch. But it's getting close. The President Gerald Ford. Big. The largest ship ever built they say. It's a massive ship. So I get on there but they're having trouble with the catapult system because it used to be steam."
00:38:47 - 00:39:13 (25 sec),"You've seen it where the planes go off steam, old-fashioned, right? Old-fashioned. So they've decided to go magnetic -- never been done before -- and electronic. So it's very, very complex. They have these brilliant guys from MIT, where my uncle was a professor, by the way, for 40 years, brilliant guy, Dr. John Trump."
00:39:13 - 00:39:45 (33 sec),"A lot of people find it hard to believe that I had a professor -- one of the smartest people in the history of MIT, in my blood. You'd be surprised. A lot of things are surprising in life. But you have to go to MIT to figure out how this damn thing works. So I get to the boat. ""How's it going?"" ""Well, it's okay, sir, but we're having a little problem with the catapult system."" You know, that's not like so good."
00:39:45 - 00:40:21 (36 sec),"I mean, we have an aircraft carrier and you can't send planes off the damn thing. Historically, that has not proven to be a good thing for aircraft carriers. So -- so I said, ""Let me see -- "" I didn't want to see the admirals. You get tired of the admirals because this was a problem. I said,"" Let me see the catapult people."" They said, ""Sir, you don't really want to do that."" I said, ""Yeah, those are the people that know what the hell they're doing."" This thing is $900 million over budget to throw the planes off."
00:40:21 - 00:40:51 (30 sec),"And we could have had steam and it would have been done and we would have saved hundreds of millions of dollars. So I get the catapult guys, five guys come over. ""Yes, sir."" ""What do you do?"" ""Sir, I've been a catapulter. By the way, he's more proud of being a catapulter than Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady, and all of you big, high ranking Republicans are doing what the hell -- They -- they would be so bored doing what you're doing."
00:40:51 - 00:41:22 (31 sec),"Dealing with Democrats all day. That's not fun. But I said, ""So what do you do?"" He said, ""I'm a catapulter, 20 years. Yes, sir. What would you like to know, sir?"" ""Very simple question. What's better, an electric catapult or steam?"" ""Sir, steam is better."" I said, ""It's better."" I said, ""Why is it better?"" ""Well, for one thing the electric goes faster, sir."
00:41:22 - 00:41:49 (27 sec),"But it takes you two and a half minutes to bring the plane to the site. No matter what you do it's still the same two and a half. So we don't have to send the plane off every second. By the time the steam builds up we have plenty of time left. That's number one, sir. I can give you 10 other reasons but another one, sir, if the steam breaks I can fix it myself with a wrench."
00:41:49 - 00:42:10 (21 sec),"If the electronics breaks, sir, we have to send for Albert Einstein -- to try and fix it. We can't figure this damn thing out."" I never saw -- this is what happens. This is what happens. This is what happens. I hate to say it, when they make airplanes so damn complex that pilots can't fly him this is what happens."
00:42:10 - 00:42:33 (23 sec),"Now, up to a point you want to go. But we have to be careful. We're spending money on things and it's almost like they do it just to do it. And we want to be careful. We want to be smart. So we're getting that problem fixed, but it's a hell of a problem. We've confirmed 53 District Court Judges and 37 Circuit Court Judges -- who are going to interpret the Constitution as written."
00:42:33 - 00:42:52 (20 sec),"Anybody not like that here? Not too many people in this room. I can tell you a lot of people in another room across the way. Along with two outstanding Supreme Court Judges, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and as you know, Brett Kavanaugh -- who was put through a grinder like nobody has ever been put through a grinder."
00:42:52 - 00:43:17 (25 sec),"That was so unfair. That was so unfair. And Congress passed, and I'm very proud of this -- where's Greg? Greg. Greg, where are you? We worked hard on this. Greg. Greg. Right. You know what I'm going to say, Greg, because this is a great thing and I hope nobody in this room has to do it. But you know, Right to Choose."
00:43:17 - 00:43:47 (30 sec),"Right. Right. We have a right, a right. And we did something else with Greg and with everybody, we passed Choice for our military, Choice. So we have in one case, Choice, we have another, Right To Try. And I don't know if the people know what even Right To Try -- I kept saying to myself, as I was a civilian -- you don't want to use it. You don't want to use it. But I've had friends over the years, they're very ill, terminally ill."
00:43:47 - 00:44:10 (23 sec),"And if they have money they travel all over the world looking for a cure. If they don't have money they go home and there's nothing they can do. And Right To Try, which Greg and everybody was so incredible with, and we got it done, right? That was an easy. You'd think it was easy. But you know, the country had a problem because they didn't want to be sued if it doesn't work."
00:44:10 - 00:44:41 (30 sec),"The insurance companies had a problem. The drug companies had a problem because they didn't want it on their record. So we said, ""Well, I'll tell you what, we won't put these people that are so terminally ill, so sick, we won't put them on the record."" They said, ""We like that. We have a separate category."
00:44:41 - 00:45:19 (39 sec),"We like that."" And then the insurance companies had a tremendous problem. But the country did too, so I said, ""Here's what we do, they have to sign a document that exculps, that gets rid of all liability to our country. Because you know, they don't make it and then they sue our country. And I could never understand why they didn't get this passed because the law was we don't want to hurt people."
00:45:19 - 00:45:59 (40 sec),"So we don't want to give them a cure. We don't want to hurt people. And I'll tell you what, and for all of the people in this room, and every one of you who's here, you can feel proud because we have had such success. We have saved lives already and this is only seven months ago that we signed it. We've saved lives already with people going -- and what it does, is it really does, I mean, it's the ultimate test for a drug or for a possible cure."
00:45:59 - 00:46:28 (29 sec),"What's better than this? It's been a tremendous success and we got it done. It's something nobody talks about, but it's something that a lot of people respect -- and it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy. So thank you, Greg. That was a great job on that. And we pass VA Accountability. So not only VA Choice. VA Choice."
00:46:28 - 00:47:00 (32 sec),"They're standing in line for weeks and weeks in many cases, weeks and weeks, think of it. And now, rather -- these are great veterans. They stand on line, and now they go, they see a doctor, we pay for it. It doesn't matter. Number one, we do save money. It doesn't matter. We're saving lives. People are ill."
00:47:00 - 00:47:15 (16 sec),"By the time they get to the doctor they are terminally ill. And we're saving lives. But we also have done so many other things for our veterans. And if you notice, there's not a lot of complaints coming out of the VA for the first time. How long has it been since you've seen a VA that's really been well run?"
00:47:15 - 00:47:33 (18 sec),"They're doing a phenomenal job. But Accountability is great, where if they treat our veterans badly -- we have now Accountability. We say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired."" We fire them. You couldn't fire him. They could steal. They could be sadists. They were sadists. They were hurting our veterans."
00:47:33 - 00:47:59 (26 sec),"We couldn't do anything about it. And we also passed, just now, some of you in the room were there with me, a little while ago, criminal justice reform. And I'll tell you, a lot of people are very happy about that. A lot of people. And thanks to our bold agenda, we enacted with House Republicans, America now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
00:47:59 - 00:48:34 (35 sec),"We're the hottest in the world. Wherever I meet a president, a prime minister, anybody, they say, ""Congratulations on your economy."" And since our election, we've created more than 5.3 million new jobs, including half a million jobs and that number is going up to about 618,000 jobs very soon, these are manufacturing jobs that President Obama said will never happen."
00:48:34 - 00:48:58 (24 sec),"""You'd need a magic wand. It's not going to happen. Well, it's happening. We have the magic wand. And more than five million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps because we have jobs, now. Think of that. The numbers are staggering, five million off of foods. And after years of stagnation wages are rising fast and the lowest paid workers are making the biggest gains."
00:48:58 - 00:49:30 (32 sec),"We've done more things than we promised. Many more things. Like this one, African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment, and you know this because you've heard me say it and other people say it, and veteran unemployment, that's a great one, have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:49:30 - 00:49:59 (29 sec),"I mean, how do you beat that? When they talk about African American and what they want to do, I say, ""Well, I have not much to say, except that we've just hit the absolute lowest unemployment rate for African Americans in the history of our country. That's all I have to say. Goodbye, everybody."" We won the debate, right?"
00:49:59 - 00:50:21 (22 sec),"We won the debate. It should be easy. It will be interesting to see. But don't underestimate the power of Socialism to get a vote. It's what happens over a 10-year period when the country is destroyed -- but they don't care about that. When they say, ""We're going to give you a free education. We're going to give you free health care."
00:50:21 - 00:50:45 (24 sec),"We're going to not have you pay your loans for college. We're going to give you free everything. Everything is free,"" it's very seductive to people. It's not going to be so easy like you think. Now, in 10 years it's going to be easy when the country goes to hell because that's what happens, the country goes to hell."
00:50:45 - 00:51:12 (27 sec),"It happened many times. Look at Venezuela. I mean, this was the richest country in that whole -- I mean, outside of us, it was one of the richest countries in the world and now they have no food, they have no electric, they have nothing. It's sad. And that's Socialism. But when you're standing up on a stage, and a guy said, ""We're going to wipe out all costs for education."
00:51:12 - 00:51:40 (29 sec),"We're going to wipe out all healthcare. We're going to give you single payer."" They don't say that you're going to wipe out 180 private plans that people love. But it's not as easy as people think. People think it's easy. It is easy in 10 years, it's not easy now, because a lot of folks are going to say, ""Hey, wait a minute, man, if I vote for Trump, I agree the economy is good, but this guy's giving me everything."" Not that easy."
00:51:40 - 00:52:04 (23 sec),"So we have to work. We can never take it for granted. We have to explain how bad it really is. We have to do that. But this is a time of extraordinary opportunity for our nation, extraordinary. That's why, in my State of the Union Address, I asked new Democrat majority in the House to work with us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure."
00:52:04 - 00:52:22 (19 sec),"And I think we're going to have something, maybe, we could do it bipartisan there, bring down the cost of healthcare, and bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Bring down the cost. Thank you. I love that you're clapping for that because we have to talk quickly about health care to have this power in this room."
00:52:22 - 00:52:49 (27 sec),"How often do you get that? And we are going to finally secure our nation's borders. It's happening right now. And I said to Mexico last week -- you know, they have the strongest immigration laws in the world. They don't have judges. Somebody gets on their land, they say, ""Get out of here, now."" Somebody touches our land, we bring them into court, you need Perry Mason to represent them."
00:52:49 - 00:53:09 (20 sec),"They're here for years. They never come back for the trial. They say, ""Let's bring them into court. We'll bring them in. Well, you just stepped on a property. Bring them in. Be gentle. Bring them into court."" And it's called Catch and Release. It may be the dumbest program in the history of the world. You catch them and you release them."
00:53:09 - 00:53:28 (19 sec),"Oh, wonderful. We've done a great job. And then, ""You're going to come back, sir, in four years from now. January 14th, you're going to come back and we're going to give you a trial to see whether or not you can stay. But in the meantime, we're releasing you into our country."" Now, only two percent come back for the trial."
00:53:28 - 00:53:49 (21 sec),"Okay. And those are not the smartest ones, to be honest with you. The ones that come back or not the smartest ones. The 98 percent are much more than the two percent that come back. It's terrible. But I said to Mexico, ""Listen, you have the strongest immigration."" They don't have courts. They don't have Catch and Release."
00:53:49 - 00:54:10 (21 sec),"They don't have Chain Migration. They don't have Visa Lottery, a lottery. You pick a lottery. ""Oh, you're going to the United States. Congratulations."" The country does this. Do you think they put their best people in those lotteries? What the hell were you people thinking when you approved these deals? They say in all fairness, it is purely -- that's a Chuck Schumer deal."
00:54:10 - 00:54:31 (21 sec),"That was when they had enough muscle. They got this stuff passed. It's incredible. Think of it. They put names and you pick a name. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to announce so and so,"" I don't want to use names because I'll get in trouble because it's always somebody going to leak this whole damn speech to the media -- to the Fake News so I won't use the name that I'm thinking about."
00:54:31 - 00:54:57 (25 sec),"Congratulations. And then you find out he's a stone cold killer, served many years in -- These are the people they give us. What do you think? Do you think they're going to give us their finest? They don't give us -- and we take them in, ""Congratulations."" Crazy CNN, they had a reporter, they're walking up -- I mean, how bad -- I mean, how bad."
00:54:57 - 00:55:17 (21 sec),"Now they're saying, ""We were never against him with respect to collusion. We were just reporting the news."" Did you see that? That's their new theory? You know, that they weren't -- in other words, that they will fair. Yeah, they were fair. But they're interviewing this group of people, ""And what are you coming to the United States for?"" A woman says, ""Well, I'm coming for my daughter."" ""Okay, that's fair."
00:55:17 - 00:55:45 (27 sec),"What are you coming -- "" Then they go to this man, a little rough looking, ""And what are you coming for?"" ""Asylum."" ""Ah. Why?"" ""I murdered someone."" ""Oh."" The woman goes like, ""What? You murdered."" Did anybody see that? ""I murdered someone,"" he said. Right? You saw it. And she's like, ""Oh, man. Okay, back to headquarters, please."" You know, because they're trying to say how good everybody is, that these are wonderful people."
00:55:45 - 00:56:19 (35 sec),"And some of them are wonderful people. Remember when I made my first feature in Trump Tower coming down the escalator with our great First Lady that everybody loves? Everybody loves our First Lady. And I talked about different things. And I mentioned the word rape. And everybody thought it was a great speech and then about two days later, it was like sort of a delayed reaction, two days later, they said, ""He said rape! He said all sorts of -- "" Let me tell you, and I took heat."
00:56:19 - 00:56:43 (24 sec),"Do you remember the first six months? Man were they killing me in that speech. It went from being a great speech to being a disaster. And now you look at that speech and you see what's happening and that speech was so tame compared to what really is happening. That trek up from Guatemala, and Honduras, and El Salvador, it's one of the great, dangerous treks anywhere."
00:56:43 - 00:57:13 (30 sec),"And Mexico has now, because they don't want the border closed, because Mexico makes a hell of a lot of money off us. They took 30 percent of our car business. I wasn't here. The new USMCA will stop that. No more car companies are going to Mexico when they sign this deal. No more car companies. That was the most important thing for me. So now, Mexico, I said I'm closing it and I really wanted to close it, but now Mexico is saying, ""No, no, no."" The first time in decades."
00:57:13 - 00:57:32 (19 sec),"We will not let anybody get through. And they've apprehended over 1,000 people today at the -- at the Southern border, their Southern border, and they're bringing it back into their country. I said, ""Why the hell didn't somebody do that in the first place?"" But they don't want the border closed. And you know who else doesn't want the border closed, the Democrats?"
00:57:32 - 00:58:02 (30 sec),"They don't want the border closed. And I agree, it's going to be a big toll. But trade, and commerce, and making money for our country, it's all very important, but to me the most important job I have is the security of our country, even more important than those other things that I talk about all the time -- it's the security of our country."
00:58:02 - 00:58:28 (25 sec),"Instead of choosing greatness for America, House Democrats responded with radicalism, resistance. ""Resist"", that's their theme. ""Make America Great Again"" is ours, theirs is ""Resist"". You don't know what the hell they're resisting. They go around saying, ""Resist,"" and they do resist. Revenge, crazy hoaxes like we just went through, and ridiculous conspiracy theories."
00:58:28 - 00:59:12 (44 sec),"We have -- just incredible when you see what is coming out. And while Republicans are working every day to empower the American people, the Democratic agenda is all about themselves. That's all they think about is themselves. Okay? It's a disgrace what's going on. It's a disgrace. I said to somebody that's been here a long time, you people would know better than anybody, some of you that have been here, ""Has it ever been this bad?"" And they said, ""Well,"" they said, ""Yes, it was."" They said, ""During the Clinton impeachment hearings it was worse."" They said, ""There was another time in the 1880s when it was worse."" A couple of people were shot, you know."
00:59:12 - 00:59:33 (21 sec),"Even new people wouldn't do that. And the Civil War, who could forget? I would say the Civil War was bad. And by the way, speaking of the Civil War, where is Doug Collins? You're another warrior? Where's Doug Collins? Where the hell is Doug? Man, he's up there fighting. Doug. Thank you, Doug. Warrior. Where's Mark Meadows, another warrior?"
00:59:33 - 01:00:00 (27 sec),"Where's Mark Meadows? What the hell is -- Oh, don't tell me he's got one of those bad seats. Are you with Jim Jordan? That's the Freedom Caucus. What the hell happened to you guys? They're great guys. They are. Everybody in this room as far as I'm concerned. Nearly 100 House Democrats are promoting the biggest Socialist takeover in U.S. history."
01:00:00 - 01:00:24 (24 sec),"That's what's happening. The Green New Deal, it'll cost $100 trillion. Nobody has any idea what that means, $100 trillion. I have wealthy friends they say, ""Write out $1 trillion."" They have no idea. They just keep going. They say, ""Nobody has any idea."" The Democrats are also proposing a massive government takeover of healthcare that would ban private health insurance."
01:00:24 - 01:00:54 (30 sec),"And that's a tremendous thing for us to run on. Because people want -- we have 180 million people that want that. The Democratic plan would destroy American healthcare, bankrupt our country, oh, forget it, not even close, and take away your private doctors. Now, I'm only afraid that we're going to be too hard on the Green New Deal and they're not going to do it, because I want them to do it. We don't want to have them knock it out before we get to run against it so let's take it easy."
01:00:54 - 01:01:31 (37 sec),"I'm -- I'm actually saying, ""It's a wonderful thing."" The Green New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29-years -- old. A young bartender, wonderful young woman, the Green New Deal. You know, but it's crazy. You know, the first time I heard I said, ""That's the craziest thing."" You have senators that are professionals that you guys know that have been there for a long time, white hair, everything perfect, and they're standing behind her and they're shaking, they're petrified of her, ""We support the Green New Deal."" How about the woman from Hawaii, the senator from Hawaii -- highly nice woman, right?"
01:01:31 - 01:01:58 (27 sec),"Oh, I'm glad I didn't say it. I'm going to get great points from my wife for not saying that -- but she was so angry to men, right? Remember, she was screaming at men? And -- and then they asked her about the Green New Deal. ""I love it."" They said, ""Yeah, but you don't allow airplanes anymore so you can't get to Hawaii."" ""Oh, we have to work on something."" So somebody jokingly said, ""We'll build a train to Hawaii,"" and she actually thought it was a decent idea."
01:01:58 - 01:02:23 (24 sec),"So now she supports it because she thinks they're going to build a train to Hawaii. But they really believe this stuff. And you know, it's like, it's the craziest thing. They believe it. And we will have to do something but don't do it too early, please. Don't kill it because we want to be able to run against it. If they beat me with the Green New Deal I deserve to lose."
01:02:23 - 01:02:50 (27 sec),"It's true. And just to finish up, and -- and this is so important, and -- and you know, I'm doing this almost as let's get together and talk because we have to win. We have to take back the House. We have to. There's no reason to have lost it. And what really lost it and really helped us lose it was healthcare because we didn't have an alternative."
01:02:50 - 01:03:07 (17 sec),"We just said, ""Well, let's not talk -- "" Somebody came out the other day, they asked a Republican, two weeks ago, health care and he turned off the mic, ""Well, I'm going home now."" You can't do that. You got to confront it. We'll be the party of healthcare. Republicans should not run away from healthcare."
01:03:07 - 01:03:29 (22 sec),"You can't do it. You're going to get clobbered. And I have an idea and I think it's great. I spoke with Kevin about it. I spoke with a lot of your really top people, smart people, and they love it. I spoke with the Senate about it. I spoke to Mitch. Mitch didn't like it, but then he found out when we're taking the vote, right after the election."
01:03:29 - 01:03:56 (28 sec),"He said, ""Oh, I like that idea."" And I understood why he didn't like it at the beginning because it's been a tough subject. It's been a subject stay away. If we stay away from that subject we're going to lose. We're going to lose. We can't stay away. It's too important. It's too important, because the Democrats -- You know what?"
01:03:56 - 01:04:21 (25 sec),"We have the border. We have, if you look at it, we have the immigration but we have a lot -- we have the crime. We have the police. We have the military. We have so much. They have health care right now. We have to take that away from them. We take that away -- we take that away we will not even come close."
01:04:21 - 01:04:43 (22 sec),"So here's the concept, we have to protect and cannot run away from a thing called preexisting conditions. We can't do it. You're going to get clobbered. A friend of mine is running in a certain state. I'm not going to embarrass him. He's got a 20-point lead. He's running for governor. 20-point lead, it's over."
01:04:43 - 01:05:16 (33 sec),"About a month later I say, ""Hey,"" the election hadn't take place -- taken place, I said, ""How is it going out there? How's he doing?"" ""Sir, he's 20 points down."" ""Wait a minute. He was 20 points up. What are you talking about?"" ""No, sir, right now he's 20 points down. He's getting killed."" I said, ""Why?"" ""Because he wanted to terminate preexisting conditions."" Well, that was a poll."
01:05:16 - 01:05:59 (43 sec),"This is a guy, he ended up getting clobbered. He had an easy race. He was already buying the carpet for the mansion. Not our mansion, a different mansion. I guess that didn't work out too well. And I'll never forget, five governors sitting in front of me, I was making a speech, very conservative governors, and I said, because I hadn't really taken a position and, but I -- I think we have to go with the preexisting, and I'm making a speech, ""And we will support, and the Republicans cherish preexisting conditions."" And these five Southern guys down there, they're looking me, ""What the hell was that all about?"
01:05:59 - 01:06:19 (21 sec),"What?"" And I told him, I said, ""We have to support it. We should support it. We're doing the right thing. And if you don't support it, you have no chance of winning. I mean, I just want to be blunt, you have no chance of winning."" The Democrat plan will be devastating to the people with preexisting conditions."
01:06:19 - 01:07:22 (63 sec),"We have great talking points. The Republican Party will be the champion of preexisting conditions. You have to do it. Some of you like it, some of you don't, but you're going to have to like. Not only for politics, it's the right thing. We want to be the party of great health care. I am, right now, working with people, and here's the key to all of it, I'm right now working with people in this room, knowledgeable leaders in Congress and with experts in the administration, I have a couple of people, one in particular who is a total health care genius, this person knows more about healthcare and loves the subject, loves it, to come up with a great health care plan that is far less costly to the people, not to the government, to the people."
01:07:22 - 01:07:45 (23 sec),"Far less costly than Obamacare with the deductibles that are far lower. The deductibles are so high that nobody gets to use it unless you're in serious condition so serious that, frankly, the last thing on your mind is health care. I will be asking that this be my first vote immediately after the election."
01:07:45 - 01:08:06 (21 sec),"We are going to regain the House because of health care and other things, the border, the military, the police. They're for open borders and crime. We're for great borders and merit-based immigration, merit-based, so they can help our country and help our companies that are all moving into our country and need people to work."
01:08:06 - 01:08:31 (25 sec),"We're going to keep the Senate and we're going to keep the presidency and we're going to bring back the House. So essentially, what I'm saying is we're going to come up with a health care plan. We're not going to vote on it until after the election. We'll all promise it's going to be our first vote because we blew it the last time."
01:08:31 - 01:08:55 (24 sec),"Man, I was fed a bill of goods. I want to tell you, some of you, I'm still a little bit angry, but not all of you. Wasn't even your fault. But we should have done it when we had the position. But we're going to get it back and it's got to be a better plan. So we're going to give a great health care plan."
01:08:55 - 01:09:23 (28 sec),"And we're going to go and campaign on that plan with the understanding that if we win it's going to be much less expensive than Obamacare and much more usable in terms of deductibles. And what's going to happen is we're going to promise the people that if you vote for us and if they vote for you, all of you running, that we're going to vote for this."
01:09:23 - 01:09:49 (26 sec),"It's going to happen but we have to get back the House. You know what? You're going to win back the House. I think it's going to be one of the strongest things you have because people don't like Obamacare. We forgot about it. We had a very, very unfortunate vote by somebody. We were close. We were so close."
01:09:49 - 01:10:04 (15 sec),"One vote away. One vote away. But it didn't work. But this is going to be something, I think, that has even more potential. It's going to be a better plan. I already know what they're doing with it. And we're going to -- we're going to use it. We're going to campaign on that plan. And it's so much better than Obamacare."
01:10:04 - 01:10:23 (20 sec),"Now, here's your alternative, turn off whatever they talk about health care. ""I don't want to talk about it. Oh, it's a bad -- "" because, you know, I know it's a tough subject. But we have a great advantage here. And we vote right after the election. It's going to get a lot of people elected and you're going to be doing the right thing."
01:10:23 - 01:10:41 (18 sec),"Additionally, we'll be knocking the Democrats Socialistic, single payer health care plan with all of the disasters floors, including all of those great Americans that are going to lose their plan. Remember, ""You can have your doctor. You could have your plan."" I mean, so many lies, so many lies. So you're going to be campaigning against very negative things."
01:10:41 - 01:11:05 (24 sec),"You're going to win your elections because of health care. And a lot of people were upset with me because I announced this like a week ago, and I didn't want to waste my time by calling people. I didn't want to call the leaders, other than Kevin. I'd be afraid to call Kevin. But I didn't call people. They said, ""What?"
01:11:05 - 01:11:33 (28 sec),"What? I don't know anything about it."" I blame myself a little bit. But now they love it. They really like it. You're going to get elected because of it and you're going to be doing the right thing. It's a great incentive for the voters to vote for you. So instead of when they ask you a health care question and say, ""I'd -- I'd rather not answer that question."" ""But what about preexisting -- "" ""Ah, ah, Alice, take me home, Alice."
01:11:33 - 01:11:59 (27 sec),"They're asking me about preexisting -- Alice, please take me home."" And then you get clobbered. You got a plan that's a much better plan. And it's going to be your first vote when you get back to Washington. The radical Democrats are also aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth, right."
01:11:59 - 01:12:20 (21 sec),"Whoever heard of this stuff? I had it in the debate. I never use the term ripped. It was my term. And people that had been working on this on our side for years said it was an incredible moment. I didn't know about -- I didn't use that term. I never heard of that term. I thought of it during the debate, because Hillary Clinton was so staunch on abortion and rights of abortion."
01:12:20 - 01:12:41 (21 sec),"And I said, ""According to Hillary, in the ninth month you can rip -- "" that's where it came up. Does anybody remember that debate? They say that was like a big moment. You can rip the baby out of the womb and kill the baby. But now it's gotten worse. Because this maniac, the governor from Virginia, he comes up and says, ""Now the baby is born."
01:12:41 - 01:13:11 (30 sec),"And you wrap the baby gently and then you talk to the mother and dependent on what the mother says you execute the baby."" Can you imagine, whoever heard of it? I never even heard of this one. I've heard of ninth month, which is horrible. I've heard of fifth month and fourth month, but this is the baby is now born and the mother will make a decision as to whether or not that baby will be, essentially, executed."
01:13:11 - 01:13:30 (19 sec),"And he said that. He said that. And he said some other things that were unrelated to that which were bad. And believe it or not, which were covered even more so than that, which I couldn't believe that it was. His other thing, you know what that was, was covered more importantly in the media than that. And what can be more important than that?"
01:13:30 - 01:13:48 (18 sec),"That's why I've called on Congress to pass legislation banning the late-term abortion of children who can feel the pain in their mother's womb. And, you know, it's always been a very close issue. It's been for many, many years. It's been a 50/50 issue. I don't know if you saw, it was so horrible and so extreme what the Democrats in New York, you saw what was happening, they're all applauding."
01:13:48 - 01:14:11 (22 sec),"It was so horrible, so horrible, that you gained 11 points in the poll. This is the first time it's no longer -- it was a 49-51 issue for many, many -- for decades. It never really changed. It would go from 51-49 back and forth. You just picked up 11 points because of how extreme that was. It was so terrible."
01:14:11 - 01:14:27 (16 sec),"Democrats are the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, hoaxes, delusions. Whenever House Democrats are ready to abandon their extremism the Republicans here tonight are ready to work with them to deliver a much better future for all of our citizens. We're willing to work together."
01:14:27 - 01:14:54 (27 sec),"I told Nancy Pelosi the other day, I was with her, it was a nice conversation. Unfortunately, every time we have a great conversation she then goes out and does a news conference and she says I'm a terrible human being. I don't figure that but I guess that's called politics. Every day we're restoring America's strength at home and we are restoring our nation's standing all over this world."
01:14:54 - 01:15:16 (22 sec),"Two years ago ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. I was told that it would take at least two years from one month ago to get the Caliphate at 100 percent. You saw that. My generals, that I got rid of, told me it would take two years to get two percent. I went to Iraq."
01:15:16 - 01:15:57 (41 sec),"I stayed in the White House for almost four months. The only time I left was to go to Iraq. I'll tell you, if you have to get cabin fever getting cabin fever in the White House is still a good place. But I went to Iraq and I met the generals and one general said, ""Sir, we can do it in one week."" I said, ""Wait a minute, they said two years."" They said, ""That's because we're hitting them at a much different level."" And we did it and we now have 100 percent of the ISIS -- it's been completely obliterated."
01:15:57 - 01:16:18 (21 sec),"And that doesn't mean you don't have cells and these crazy people, I got to say it, because you saw it, you can never say, ""We won,"" because if you say, ""We won,"" and then somebody blows up a store, some crazy maniac. But we just beat the hell out of them. And we're trying to now beat them at the Internet because there's nobody better at the Internet than them."
01:16:18 - 01:16:42 (24 sec),"I don't know if you saw recently I put some social media that they're losers, that they're dead. That if you join them you will be killed just like they're killed. We got to beat them at their own game, folks. It's not a very nice game. And they don't surrender. When we had them, I was telling Kevin McCarthy, when we had them four or five days ago, they were cornered."
01:16:42 - 01:17:08 (26 sec),"They don't know what it is to be cornered because they always had free reign. They're not -- they don't have free reign with me. And we flew over with brand new F-18s, Super Hornets, and they're going 2,000 miles an hour over and over for two days. And I said, ""Do these people ever like wave the flag? Do they ever surrender?"" And the General Raisin Cane, his name?"
01:17:08 - 01:17:45 (37 sec),"What's your first name? You know this. ""Sir my first name is Raisin."" This guy's out of central casting, I'm telling you. There's nobody in Hollywood that could look like this guy because he's much tougher. That I can tell you. I said, ""What's your name?"" ""Raisin."" ""What's your last name?"" ""Cane."" I said, ""You mean your name is Raisin Cane?"" ""Yes, sir."" That's the guy that told me. I said, ""So, my people tell me two years."
01:17:45 - 01:18:07 (21 sec),"What do you think?"" ""One week, sir."" I said, ""General, come here. Give me a kiss."" I felt like Joe Biden. But I meant it. See, I meant it, big difference. I meant it. So we knocked them out. And we now have knocked them out. And we have -- but I always say you have some crazy people around, nevertheless."
01:18:07 - 01:18:24 (18 sec),"Together, we're also fully rebuilding the American Armed Forces -- and you're doing that, what you're doing is incredible. Because without that the other things might not matter. It's a rough time of this world. I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal -- and Iran is a different country."
01:18:24 - 01:18:56 (32 sec),"When I first came here, Iran was going to take over the Middle East and there was no stopping him. And I took out of that deal. I terminated that deal and they have gone to hell. That's a different country. They have riots. Their economy is collapsed. It was a horrible, stupid deal. We gave them $150 billion and they used it to fight us. We gave them $1.8 billion in cash, airplane loads of cash."
01:18:56 - 01:19:16 (20 sec),"And I recognized the capital of Israel and we opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem for a $1 billion under budget. $1 billion under budget. We were going to spend $1 billion to build it. I got it done for $400,000. Think of that. So I saved $1 billion. I took a building that we already owned on land that we already owned."
01:19:16 - 01:19:43 (27 sec),"Somebody said, ""What's the difference between that piece of land and the piece that we were going to spend a fortune to buy?"" I said, ""The difference is it's much better. It's a better location. It's a much bigger site."" Other than that, they were very similar. And to support Israel's security just last week, and this has been going on for 58 years, I recognized fully Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights."
01:19:43 - 01:20:08 (25 sec),"58 years, they've been talking. They've had committees, they've had meetings, they've had 32 different meetings and it's talk and they never do it. So we did it. And I'll tell you what, I don't know about the United States, I think we're doing well, but I can run for the prime minister of Israel. That's what they tell me. I think I've been 90 -- I think I'm at 98 percent in Israel."
01:20:08 - 01:20:36 (28 sec),"You'd better be careful, I'll leave here and I'll go run in Israel. The United States has also taking decisive action against the brutal Socialist dictatorship in Venezuela. That's a horrible situation. And America, once again, stands with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, in their righteous struggle for freedom and we're helping them out."
01:20:36 - 01:20:56 (20 sec),"So we're gathered here tonight at a very pivotal moment in our nation's history. That's true. This is a very important moment. You know, we have forces going against this country from within that can destroy this country. If we lose this election -- You know, when I go out to make a speech I meet people."
01:20:56 - 01:21:18 (22 sec),"I don't get to see too many people, but I meet people backstage going on. And they'd say to me, ""Thank you, sir, for saving our country."" They're talking to all of us, by the way. ""Thank you, sir."" A man came up to me a week ago. We were in Michigan. We had a tremendous crowd in Michigan. Right? Is that right?"
01:21:18 - 01:21:45 (27 sec),"That's a good group. Great crowd. And this guy looked like he never cried in his life. He looked like football player, a big strong guy and he was pouring down tears as I'm getting ready to speak. I'm walking by and he was there and he said, ""Sir, thank you for saving our country."" And I used to be surprised because I've been hearing this for a year and a half, I used to be surprised."
01:21:45 - 01:22:16 (31 sec),"You know, it's a big statement and they're oftentimes crying. And they're people that don't cry. These are not criers. These are people that are real stalwarts, not crying. Nothing wrong with crying, but they often are crying. And I've heard it so much. We have an election coming up that if something bad should happen with this election we could lose the country, we really could, because these people are stone cold crazy."
01:22:16 - 01:22:41 (25 sec),"What they want to do to our country would be overwhelming. It would be horrible. So we have no choice, we have to win. We really have to win. Now, it could be the start moving in a different direction, but I don't think so. It looks like they're only moving one way. The majority of American people support our common sense agenda."
01:22:41 - 01:23:05 (24 sec),"And Americans do not want to risk their prosperity or our prosperity. They don't want to risk their children's future. They don't want to risk their wealth. They don't want to risk their 401ks, where they're up 50, 60, 70, 80 percent. I talk about it all the time. They feel like financial geniuses. They've never been there before."
01:23:05 - 01:23:31 (26 sec),"And we're going to explain to them that your 401k will disappear. You're not going to have anything. We have a lot of great things going. So the Democrat program of radical Socialism and open borders, if we are good, and if we are smart, and if we do our job, it cannot work. It's not going to work. Because our people are doing too well."
01:23:31 - 01:23:51 (21 sec),"The choice has never been clearer, the Republican Party is the party for all Americans. We really are. We have changed this party so dramatically, folks. I -- I say all of us, not just me. I've been -- I've been important. You've been just as important. We're now the party of the American worker. Did you ever hear?"
01:23:51 - 01:24:21 (30 sec),"When I started doing this we were like the party of the rich person and we will losing and there were not enough rich people. We're now the party of the American family and we're the party of the American dream. It's true, you are. In South Carolina, when I was going against a lot of different people, there were 12 people left, and I'll never forget somebody came down and said, ""You have no idea what you've done."
01:24:21 - 01:24:41 (20 sec),"Thousands and tens of thousands of people are joining the Republican Party. This has never happened."" They've never seen it before. And this happened in New Hampshire. It happened to all over. It happens in Florida. It's happening now in Florida. I mean, I don't like to talk about leads to early, but we have an incredible lead in the state of Florida."
01:24:41 - 01:25:12 (31 sec),"We have an incredible lead in the state of Ohio. We have a great lead in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in South Carolina. I mean, we have leads. Now, you always have to be very careful because you have, on occasion, seen leads disappear, but we're not going to let that happen. Because we have the far better ideas, the far better platform, and I know many of the people in this room, we have the far better and more talented people."
01:25:12 - 01:25:48 (36 sec),"You are the people I'm talking about. And we believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe in religious liberty. The right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms."
01:25:48 - 01:26:14 (26 sec),"We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we believe in the words of our national motto, ""In God We Trust"". We're not going to lose that. We're not going to lose that. People want to play with that. They're not playing with that one."
01:26:14 - 01:26:50 (36 sec),"They want to play with that, you know that. We're not playing with that one. ""In God We Trust"". We fight on behalf of hardworking citizens who pay their taxes, follow our laws, raise their children, protect our communities, and made this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth. And we're doing better now than we've done in decades, and decades, and decades."
01:26:50 - 01:27:23 (33 sec),"This land is our home. These American patriots have always been loyal to our country and we will forever be loyal to them, forever. Every day for the next 19 months we will keep on fighting, we will keep on working, and we will keep on winning, winning, winning for the American people -- and for yourselves, and for yourselves, and your families."
01:27:23 - 01:28:11 (48 sec),"With your help, on November 3rd 2020 Republicans are going to win the House, we are going to win the Senate, and we are going to, again, win the White House. Thank you. And together with the love, prayers, and devotion of everyone in this really warm and incredible room, and millions of patriots across our land, we are going to Make America Great Again."
01:28:11 - 01:28:31 (20 sec),"We are going to make America greater than it's ever been before. And we are going to do it not just for you, not just for your friends, we are going to do it for all Americans. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you, everybody."
00:00:00 - 00:00:29 (29 sec),"We love that song, but let's get going. Right? I want to thank you all, and I want to thank, especially, Melania -- she works so hard -- and those moving words, even though it is from your wife, so she's maybe a little bit prejudiced in that way. But I will say that she is a hard worker and has a profound commitment to building a drug-free future for America's children."
00:00:29 - 00:00:59 (30 sec),"We're going to do it too. We're going to do it. Made a lot of progress. Today, I'm honored to join the thousands of leaders -- and that's what you are: leaders -- from across the country for the 2019 Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. Very important. Everyone here today is united by the same vital goal: to liberate our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction and to end the opioid crisis once and for all."
00:00:59 - 00:01:34 (35 sec),"It's happening. It's happening. That's happening. I want to recognize the founder of Operation UNITE for his unwavering community service, for his incredible commitment, and to address this critical issue: Congressman Hal Rogers. A friend of mine for a long time. And I want to thank you very much, Hal, wherever you may be. Thank you."
00:01:34 - 00:02:00 (26 sec),"Thank you, Hal. Good job. Very dedicated guy. We're also grateful to Operation UNITEâs President and CEO, Nancy Hale. Thank you, Nancy. And thanks also to an outstanding public servant, a man who works day and night. No matter when I need him, he's there. I'll call him at the strangest hours."
00:02:00 - 00:02:24 (24 sec),"He's always there working. Secretary Alex Azar. It's really great, Alex, what you're doing. Thank you. And CDC Administrator, Dr. Robert Redfield, who is helping us to eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2030. And we're there; we're going to be able to do that. People are shocked. Please, stand up, Doctor. So important."
00:02:24 - 00:02:48 (24 sec),"I said that recently in a speech: We will eradicate AIDS by 2030. We've made such incredible progress. And they didnât know what I was talking about. They couldnât believe it. They came up to me after the speech, Doctor. They said, ""Do you mean that?"" That's right -- we're going to have it eradicated by 2030. Thank you very much, Doctor."
00:02:48 - 00:03:10 (22 sec),"Very important. Also with us is the Lieutenant Governor of this great state, a friend of mine and a man who -- he's worked so hard with Brian. The combination of Jeff Duncan and Brian has been pretty much unbeatable. They're doing a fabulous job. Jeff, thank you very much. Jeff, where are you? Jeff? Jeff, thank you."
00:03:10 - 00:03:36 (27 sec),"Stand up, Jeff. Great job. Really great job. And, Mrs. Duncan, thank you very much. And the Georgia Attorney General, Chris Carr. Chris, thank you. Tough guy. And he's in there fighting for us. I know that. As well as members of Congress: Rick Allen, Drew Ferguson, Barry Loudermilk, and Jody Hice."
00:03:36 - 00:04:02 (26 sec),"We have them all. We have them all. Thatâs a pretty unbeatable group. Weâve been doing okay together, havenât we? Huh? Weâve been doing good. To all of the people in this room who serve every day on the frontiers and frontlines of this crisis -- and a crisis it is -- you have earned the gratitude of our entire nation."
00:04:02 - 00:04:33 (31 sec),"You may not even know it, but our nation loves you and they love what youâre doing. Thank you very much. You are the first responders who bring patients back to life. You are the law enforcement officers who bring drug traffickers to justice. You are the doctors, nurses, and counselors who give struggling citizens the hope and solace and strength to build a brighter and brighter future."
00:04:33 - 00:05:05 (32 sec),"And you are the families and faith communities who help thousands of Americans overcome addiction for a new life of freedom. My administration is deploying every resource at our disposal to empower you, to support you, and to fight right by your side. And thatâs what weâre doing. We will not solve this epidemic overnight, but we will stop -- thereâs just nothing going to stop us, no matter how you cut it. I know some of the people in this room."
00:05:05 - 00:05:30 (25 sec),"Nothing stops you. Nothing stops you, I can tell you. We will never stop until our job is done, and then maybe weâll have to find something new. And I hope thatâs going to be soon. But we will succeed. We have results that are unbelievable; numbers that I heard, two weeks ago, that I was shocked to hear."
00:05:30 - 00:05:56 (26 sec),"Weâre making tremendous progress. Each year, more than 70,000 precious American lives are lost to the opioid and drug crisis. And, in my opinion, the number is much higher than that. To protect all Americans, my administration declared the opioid epidemic a nationwide public health emergency. A big step."
00:05:56 - 00:06:36 (40 sec),"Since then, we have secured a record $6 billion in new funding to combat the opioid crisis, and thatâs the most ever. And weâre going for even bigger numbers this year. Last year, we provided $90 million to prevent youth substance abuse, and I signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act -- the largest-ever legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in our nationâs history."
00:06:36 - 00:07:13 (37 sec),"Itâs the largest ever. Following the recommendation of my Surgeon General and many others, last year the distribution of the overdose-reversing drug, naloxone, increased by over one million units. Pretty amazing stuff. To expand access to treatment, recovery, and other crucial activities and services, all throughout our nation we have given opioid response grants to states, totaling a record $2 billion."
00:07:13 - 00:07:35 (22 sec),"We are now allowing states to use Medicaid funds to pay for residential treatment facilities, and theyâre being built all over the country. In my first year in office, the number of patients receiving medication-assisted treatment at community health centers increased by 64 percent. No other President did that."
00:07:35 - 00:08:31 (56 sec),"No other President. We have no choice. We have no choice. We passed the CRIB Act to expand treatment for mothers and their babies who are born physically dependent on opioids. For our nationâs veterans, we are improving pain management, with over 43,000 fewer veterans on opioids since January 2017. Think of that -- 43,000. Twenty-three thousand [Forty-three thousand]. And, by the way, for the veterans, 45 years theyâve been trying to get it. As you know, just recently, I signed Veterans Choice, where a veteran can go, and if the wait is going to be days or weeks or months -- which it used to be -- they go out and see a private doctor."
00:08:31 - 00:09:02 (31 sec),"Take immediate care. We pay for it. We take care of it. And it's been an incredible -- it's new and it's been incredible, the difference it's made. And just months ago, I signed bipartisan criminal justice reform into law. Among other critical changes, the FIRST Step Act provides addiction treatment to Americans in prison."
00:09:02 - 00:09:43 (41 sec),"And I'm pleased to report that, in just four months, more than 16,000 inmates are participating in new drug treatment. And criminal justice reform -- I have to say, people are getting out of prison. And since our founding, they were having an impossible time getting a job. But because our economy is doing so well, perhaps the best it's ever been in our history -- best unemployment numbers in history, best everything."
00:09:43 - 00:10:07 (24 sec),"Because of this -- because of this, prisoners getting out are signing in; they're getting jobs. And I can tell you that those employers -- because I speak to a lot of them -- are thrilled. They had no idea. I'm so proud of that. So, the great economy has made it much easier. They get out, and then they have to prove themselves."
00:10:07 - 00:10:26 (19 sec),"They never got a chance to prove themselves. Now they prove themselves, and they are doing a spectacular job. Not all of them, but there's nothing ""all"" about any of us. But they are doing a spectacular job. So I want to thank all of you. And I want to thank -- Congressman, I want to thank you for helping me with that, because you were very instrumental."
00:10:26 - 00:10:52 (26 sec),"Thank you very much. Thank you. The Department of Labor is expanding federal efforts to help recovering Americans find a great job in our soaring economy. As a result of our historic economic boom also, we are lifting up all Americans from all walks of life, including those who have endured the pain of addiction."
00:10:52 - 00:11:09 (17 sec),"They're getting a second and third and, in some cases, a fourth chance. And they're making it. They're making it. And they really have something to live for. Some of them say, ""We love getting up in the morning. We love going to work. We love our job."" And if they don't like the job because of what's happened, it's a miracle."
00:11:09 - 00:11:35 (26 sec),"All over the world, they're talking about what's happened with our economy. If they don't like their job, they have choice also, like the vets. They have choice. It's choice of going out and finding a different job that they like better. Big impact. Last year, a record 73 percent of the new jobs went to people who were out of the workforce and are now coming back to work for the first time in many years."
00:11:35 - 00:12:03 (28 sec),"And these newly employed citizens are joining 5.5 million more workers who have found jobs since the election, driving our national unemployment rate to its lowest level in 51 years. And, as you know, and you've heard me say it, African American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country."
00:12:03 - 00:12:30 (26 sec),Asian American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country. Hispanic American unemployment: lowest in the history of our country. People that graduate without a high school diploma -- it's a big group -- lowest in the history of our country. Women -- sorry -- lowest in 61 years. [Laughter] But we'll soon have the record.
00:12:30 - 00:12:55 (25 sec),"We will soon have the record. We're going to have that record, too. We're all Americans. We are all one family. And we know that we are strongest when no one is left behind. My administration is committed to ensuring that every citizen can live with dignity and purpose and proudly pursue the American Dream."
00:12:55 - 00:13:43 (48 sec),"Critical to this effort is my administrationâs strong support for faith-based initiatives. America is a nation that believes in the power of prayer and the strength of fellowship, and we believe in the grace of God. And we're proud of it. Here with us today is Dr. Monty Burks. Nineteen years ago, Monty turned his life around when two women of prayer from his hometown church helped him to get on a path to recovery."
00:13:43 - 00:14:08 (25 sec),"Now Monty works for Tennesseeâs -- what a great state -- Department of Mental Health and is Director of their Faith-Based Recovery Initiative. Monty, please, come up and tell us a little bit about your work."
00:14:08 - 00:14:33 (25 sec),"In awe, honor, and humbled. The opposite of addiction is relationship. That simple equation is what helped me find my freedom. Criminal justice intervention led me to treatment, which led me to recover, which put me on this podium. I've been blessed to serve under Commissioner Williams -- and Commissioner Varney past before."
00:14:33 - 00:14:48 (15 sec),"They took a chance on a broken and bruised person who had been touched by the system, but they knew that I had a purpose, and my purpose was to use the pain that I'd went through to help other people not have to go through the same thing that I'd went through. You see, recovery is real. We do recover. We do recover."
00:14:48 - 00:15:17 (29 sec),"To me, the paradigm shifts with the faith community. Our governor, Bill Lee, supports the faith-based community being the catalyst to change, to control the narrative, to explain how people and recovery can come back and be fruitful and change the paradigm themselves, in their own communities."
00:15:17 - 00:15:38 (21 sec),"Employers trust the faith community. We go back to work not just for a job but for a career, so we can go back and lead as peers so those who were behind us crying in the wilderness will have a second chance to stand before a podium like this and tell you that, yes, recovery is real. We do recover."
00:15:38 - 00:16:06 (27 sec),"Secretary Azar, I want to thank you for your work with HHS and the Office of Faith-Based with Shannon Royce and Heidi. And they spread the word and the message about faith-based recovery and treatment across the state. Today, this is my pulpit, and I have to say this: Someone in a program hears me right now and says, ""I can, because you did."
00:16:06 - 00:16:20 (14 sec),"I can, because he did."" That's right. Yes, you can. Look in the mirror. There is your miracle. I want to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me this space to stand beside you. I want to thank God for you and the First Lady and your support of the recovery community. Thank you."
00:16:20 - 00:17:11 (51 sec),"Wow, that's great, Monty. And he had this beautiful speech written down in his iPhone -- this is the new way of doing it -- [Laughter] -- and he never looked at it once. [Laughter] That's a pretty good job. Thank you very much, Monty. Appreciate it. Fantastic. My administration has also embarked on an unprecedented effort to shut down online criminal networks, crack down on illegal international shipments, and stop the deadly flow of drugs into our country."
00:17:11 - 00:17:37 (26 sec),"In the past two years, Customs and Border Protection seizures of meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl at the southern border are up 45 percent and going up much higher. We are seizing it all over. You probably saw the numbers today. We are detaining, capturing -- call it anything you want -- more people than ever before."
00:17:37 - 00:18:07 (30 sec),"Some of those people are not people we want in our country. And I will say Border Patrol has been incredible. There's never been a march up that border like there is today, up throughout Mexico. Mexico is starting to detain and bring back to their country, where they came from. But a lot of it is drugs, and drugs are being gotten by us. We are stopping the drug flow as much as we can."
00:18:07 - 00:18:27 (20 sec),"Soon, we're going to have a wall that's going to be a very powerful wall. It's under construction. The media doesnât like talking about it. The media doesnât like talking about it. It's one of many things we're doing. But when that wall is finished, we intend to have almost 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year."
00:18:27 - 00:18:52 (25 sec),"We're probably ahead of schedule a little bit. That'll have a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country. And we have many other things, including the finest equipment that that you can buy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the best drug detection equipment you can have. And I always say this: Because as good as that equipment is -- and itâs genius -- the greatest equipment in the world is a dog."
00:18:52 - 00:19:13 (22 sec),"Dogs -- a certain type of German Shepherd in particular. Dogs do a better job than 400 million dollars' worth of equipment. Can you believe that? Only the dog lover would understand that, right? No, it's true. I said to the Border Patrol the other day -- they were giving me a little bit of a rundown on the equipment."
00:19:13 - 00:19:32 (18 sec),"And, you know, itâs hundreds -- weâre close to 500 million dollars' worth of equipment at the ports of entry. I said, âHow does this compare to those great dogs I saw?â They say, âSir, honestly, the dogs are better.â [Laughter] I said, âYou got to be kidding.â Itâs incredible, and they showed me, and itâs actually incredible."
00:19:32 - 00:19:57 (25 sec),"But we also have a lot of dogs, and theyâre great dogs, and we cherish them. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which enters our country through our southern border. Weâre doing everything to empower ourselves so that we can keep this poison out of our communities and away from our children."
00:19:57 - 00:20:17 (20 sec),"You're going to see some very, very big differences in the coming months. Weâre capturing people that you wouldnât believe. And if you remember, when I announced that famous run, when I came down -- Iâm sure nobody saw this. When I came down the escalator with Melania and her white dress -- I donât think anybody saw that -- [Laughter] -- but I made a very strong statement about the border and I was criticized."
00:20:17 - 00:21:04 (47 sec),"They said, âOh, itâs not that bad.â Well, let me tell you, that statement was peanuts compared to reality. Peanuts. It was small-time, compared to reality. But we are confronting reality and confronting the grave security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border. And thatâs why Iâve declared a national emergency, which is exactly what it is. And weâve secured historic funding to strengthen border security, including the equipment, including the wall, including more Border Patrol agents -- including many other things that you donât even have to know about and some you donât want to know about."
00:21:04 - 00:21:37 (33 sec),"Congress must also act to fix, however, our horrible, obsolete, weak, pathetic immigration laws. We could solve the entire problem -- I say â45 minutes,â but it could go a lot quicker than that; letâs bring it down to 15 minutes -- if the Democrats would agree to do certain basic, commonsense things with respect to our laws."
00:21:37 - 00:21:55 (18 sec),"And I do think that thereâs pressure being put on them, and I think that some of them really do want to do the right thing. Iâve spoken to some recently, and you might be surprised at whatâs going to happen. But they see whatâs going on at the border. Itâs very easy to see. And theyâre seeing the drugs and theyâre seeing the human trafficking."
00:21:55 - 00:22:16 (20 sec),"The human trafficking has -- itâs like never before in our history. And this is a world problem, and itâs happening all over the world, but for us, itâs through the southern border. Today, weâre grateful to be joined by Virginia State Police Senior Special Agent Tom Murphy, who has been chasing down drug traffickers for decades."
00:22:16 - 00:22:50 (34 sec),"In recent years, he has seen a surge of cheap heroin being trafficked from Mexico, which is now being laced with ultra-lethal fentanyl. Tragically, a year and a half ago, Special Agent Murphyâs own son died from an overdose of this kind of deadly drug. And it is deadly. Special Agent Murphy, Americaâs heart breaks for you and for all of the families that have suffered so needlessly."
00:22:50 - 00:23:10 (21 sec),"No other family should have to experience the pain and the sorrow that youâve endured. Would you please come up to say a few words? Please, Special Agent. Thank you."
00:23:10 - 00:23:35 (24 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President and First Lady, for this time and opportunity to speak. Both professionally and personally, Hal has touched my life and my familyâs life. I worked for the State Police of Virginia for 31 years, assigned to a narcotics division drug enforcement section for 23 of those 31 years. I sat in your seat four years ago, at this same conference."
00:23:35 - 00:24:08 (34 sec),"While I was here four years ago, my son Jason was battling drug addiction. His story is one thatâs all too common today. He grew up with ADD, depression, and was medicated at a young age. Prior to 18 years old, he started self-medicating with marijuana. He knew at 18 years old he had to move out of the house because Dad is Dad, and Dad is a police officer, and you canât do that at home."
00:24:08 - 00:24:34 (26 sec),"Well, on his 18th birthday -- on the day he turned 18 -- he moved out of our home. He would later tell me it's the worst decision he's ever made in his life. When he did so, about a year or two later, he had a work-related injury where he severed four fingers from his hand. He was introduced to opioids, which was my greatest fear."
00:24:34 - 00:25:12 (38 sec),"I would see him around town, and my wife -- you could his physical decline. He'd been arrested a couple of times for possession and distribution to continue his habit. Twelve days before Christmas -- December 13th, 2017, 12 days before Christmas, he passed away of a heroin and fentanyl overdose."
00:25:12 - 00:25:52 (40 sec),"People talk about stigma associated with opioids, heroin, drugs. There is a stigma, and the stigma needs to stop. If you want to think about stigma, think about a family that's been though it professionally and personally. And my family has. And that's only one family of 70,000 in 2017 who lost a loved one because of opioids and heroin."
00:25:52 - 00:26:21 (29 sec),"The stigma needs to stop. You need to share your story. I wear two bracelets every day since my son's death. On my right wrist is a purple bracelet to honor those who have fallen from drug overdose. It has his name on it and date and birth and date of death. On my left wrist, I have two: Thin Blue Line and I've got another one that simply states, ""Every overdose is someone's child. Don't judge. Educate."""
00:26:21 - 00:27:01 (39 sec),"So that's why we're here and that's why you're here. You took the first initiative, maybe, if you're here for the first time, to collaborate, to brainstorm, to strategize, to figure out this problem collectively. But the message I want to convey today is: Don't judge. There are 70,000 different stories that happened in 2017. You heard my son's. His name was Matthew Jason Murphy. Thank you."
00:27:01 - 00:28:13 (73 sec),"Thank you. You know, I think I can say with surety that your son, your boy, is looking down right now at you and he's very proud of his father. Very, very proud. Thank you. We are making great progress to stop fentanyl from coming into our communities. As a result of my negotiations with President Xi of China -- doing a very big trade deal -- they've announced that next week they will implement new measures to prevent Chinese fentanyl -- which is most of it; almost all fentanyl comes from China -- from being shipped to the United States."
00:28:13 - 00:28:42 (29 sec),"And furthermore -- and I appreciate this, from President Xi -- they've agreed that they're going to make it a major crime. It's not a crime now. It's down as an industrial drug. And they're going to make it a crime, and they're going to charge people with the highest level of crime. And, in China, unlike in our country, the highest level of crime is very, very high."
00:28:42 - 00:29:18 (36 sec),"It's the ultimate. You pay the ultimate price. So I appreciate that very much. Since I signed the STOP Act into law, our amazing Customs and Border Protection officers have stopped over six times more packages from reaching American doorsteps. It's a big deal. Right here, in Georgia, Customs and Border Protection officers at the seaport in Savannah recently discovered an estimated 19 million dollars' worth of cocaine in a shipment of Colombian pineapples."
00:29:18 - 00:29:47 (29 sec),"Today, we're proud to be joined by two officers who helped find those deadly drugs: James Long and Derrick Nobles. And thank you both for your courageous work. Where are you, folks? Where are you? Come on. Come on up here. Come up. Please."
00:29:47 - 00:30:04 (17 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you all for having us here, first of all. And again, thank you for all your support. It's been a -- it's been a long road, and we're glad to have the President behind us. I'm glad to have you all behind us on the law enforcement side and the community itself, because you all are our biggest help with finding this."
00:30:04 - 00:30:10 (6 sec),"It's like finding a needle in the haystack, on most days. But again, thank you all every day for your support. Thank you."
00:30:10 - 00:30:39 (29 sec),"Thank you. Thank you both very much. Great job. So many incredible people that I've met doing exactly what you're doing. To all of the Customs and Border Protection officers, DEA agents, and state and local law enforcement that are here today: We love you, we support you, and we are with you all the way."
00:30:39 - 00:31:07 (28 sec),"All the way. You know, we had billions of dollars of military equipment, which the previous administration, for their own reason, was not willing to give up to law enforcement. And I decided that we will. This was beautiful, great, strong, powerful equipment, safety equipment. You know exactly what I'm talking about."
00:31:07 - 00:31:26 (19 sec),"And we gave billions and billions of dollars throughout the United States to law enforcement. And it's had a tremendous impact because -- I don't know if it's for that reason. Probably not. It's probably because of the great men and women involved. But the numbers are way down. Crime -- way down. So, thank you all very much."
00:31:26 - 00:32:03 (38 sec),"Appreciate it. My administration is also taking aggressive action to reduce the over-supply of highly addictive prescription drugs. The Department of Justice has prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in cases involving opioids. And earlier this week, the United States filed criminal charges against the sixth- largest drug wholesaler for illicit distribution of opioids -- because we are holding big pharma accountable."
00:32:03 - 00:32:30 (26 sec),They should be accountable. And they didn't give to my campaign. I don't want their money. [Laughter] They gave to a lot of other campaigns; that's the problem. But we are holding them -- I couldn't care less. They've got to do what's right. Doing a lot of things. We're also working very strong on drug pricing.
00:32:30 - 00:33:07 (37 sec),"It's coming way down. For the first time -- for the first time in 54 years, drug prices went down this year. They went down a little below even. That's a big thing. First time in 54 years. And I give great credit to you, Alex, for that. You and your whole group of wonderful people. Alex was a very, very successful executive at one of the biggest of the companies, and he understood the system better than anybody."
00:33:07 - 00:33:31 (24 sec),And we're lucky to have him. He has done an incredible job. Thank you very much. Many drug companies are giving European countries a better deal than they give their own country. And that has to stop. We've already informed them that's stopping. We are making sure that our great seniors on Medicare will share in the discounts given to other countries.
00:33:31 - 00:34:02 (31 sec),"And you know what that means. The sophisticates out there that do this for a living, you know exactly -- that's a big deal. Sounds like big deal, but it really is a big deal. At long last, we're stopping the drug companies and foreign countries from rigging the system -- I know all about the rigging the system because I had the system rigged on me. [Laughter and applause] I think you know what I'm talking about."
00:34:02 - 00:34:25 (23 sec),"Unfortunately, that will be your sound bite tonight, but that's okay. [Laughter] System was rigged. But rigging the system against our great seniors. And to help doctors and scientists develop non-addictive painkillers, we have nearly doubled funding for opioid and pain research. Thank you very much, Doctor."
00:34:25 - 00:34:58 (33 sec),"Come on. Stand. He gives away more money than any human being on Earth. Thank you. Great. Such an important -- if we can find that answer, that's going to be a big -- that's going to solve most of the problem, I suspect. How close are we? [Laughter] He's saying, ""Okay."" [Laughter] You'll get it. You'll get it. One year ago, we pledged to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third."
00:34:58 - 00:35:31 (33 sec),"Already during my time in office, we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent. That's a pretty amazing number. Pretty amazing. And I'm glad to report today that drug overdose deaths are down in the various states that we polled and checked -- the ones hardest hit by the opioid crisis: New Hampshire, West Virginia, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Ohio."
00:35:31 - 00:35:56 (25 sec),"And they're very steeply down in three of those cases. An amazing achievement. When I campaigned in those states, that was the biggest thing. And nobody would think it. Unless you're really involved, nobody would think it. Over the last two years, our National Prescription Drug Take Back Days have collected nearly 3.7 million pounds of prescription drugs."
00:35:56 - 00:36:31 (34 sec),"Thatâs seven times the weight of Air Force One -- a very nice plane that's parked about 10 minutes away. [Laughter] A very, very big, big, heavy plane. Think of that: seven times. And the next drug take back day is this Saturday. It's great. And finally, we know one of the most important steps to ending the opioid crisis is to prevent young people from ever using drugs in the first place."
00:36:31 - 00:37:07 (36 sec),"Our massive public awareness campaign about the horrific suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58 percent of young Americans. Where's Kellyanne? Kellyanne, stand up. Kellyanne Conway. She's done a great job. I keep saying, ""Kellyanne, where are those ads?"" Because, you know, if you do it properly -- and we've had some great ones, great ads -- young people looking at these ads, they won't start."
00:37:07 - 00:37:51 (44 sec),"I think, in many ways, you don't see the result for four or five years, but in many ways, that's one of the most important things we can be doing. So we're doing that and we're spending a lot of money on that. I think it's very important. When they look out, and somebody comes to them and wants to sell them drugs and they start thinking about what they just saw on television, or wherever they may have seen it, it's going to be a little harder for them to make that sale, and that's okay with me. It's the way we want it. And I'm very encouraged that in my first year in office, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 100,000 fewer teens started abusing prescription painkillers."
00:37:51 - 00:38:15 (25 sec),"One hundred thousand. Here with us today is Alex Elswick and his mom -- wonderful mom -- Shelley. As a young adult, Alex overcame addiction and is now -- with his mom, they founded an organization to help families in crisis. Alex and Shelley, would you come up and share your story? Thank you. Please."
00:38:15 - 00:38:24 (9 sec),"Well, good afternoon."
00:38:24 - 00:38:26 (2 sec),Go Cats!
00:38:26 - 00:38:57 (31 sec),"[Laughs] Go Cats. My name is Alex Elswick, and I'm a person in long-term recovery. And many of you already knew that, but perhaps what you didn't know is that this is my mom. And we're a family in long-term recovery. And I could tell you all about how my addiction was ""Groundhog Day"" in hell -- lived over and over and over again."
00:38:57 - 00:39:26 (29 sec),"But we've heard enough of death and destruction for a few years now. I'd rather tell you how grateful I am to be here and how grateful I am that I get to work every day alongside my mom and my friend, Amanda Fallin-Bennett, doing the work with Voices of Hope to help people in recovery stay in recovery. And I'd like to use this time to say a big ""thank you"" to every single individual in this room who works tirelessly every day to improve the lives of people like me. Because Monty said it best: We do recover and we recover together. So thank you all for being voices of hope."
00:39:26 - 00:40:20 (53 sec),"And thank you both. As Alex and Shelley remind us, our greatest resource in the fight against drugs is the heart and the might and the soul of the American people. We will prevail because of the courage, commitment, and compassion of heroes like all of you in this room today. You're incredible people. You are Americaâs true source of strength."
00:40:20 - 00:40:49 (30 sec),"So let us resolve that, together, we will support, cherish and care for our fellow citizens through every step and every challenge on their road to recovery. We will reach out to anyone who is hurting or lost or struggling, because every American deserves to know the glory of hope, the joy of belonging, and the blessings of healing."
00:40:49 - 00:41:22 (33 sec),"We will stand proudly behind our devoted doctors and nurses and medical professionals who work so hard, and they do so much. We will honor and celebrate the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you. We love our law enforcement. I don't know if you know it, but over the last two and half years, law enforcement has become hot."
00:41:22 - 00:41:48 (26 sec),"They were having a little problem, right? But they're hot. People are loving their law enforcement more than ever before because we respect you at the highest level. We respect you. And the job you do is incredible -- and dangerous -- but it's incredible. We will strive to give every child a loving home, and every home a thriving future."
00:41:48 - 00:42:18 (30 sec),"We will renew the bonds of family and faith that link us together as citizens, as patriots, and as Americans. We will not let up. We will not give in. And we will never, ever give up on saving American lives. We will end this terrible menace. We will smash the grip of addiction. We will make our cities safe, our communities strong, and our future brighter than ever before."
00:42:18 - 00:42:40 (22 sec),"As one united nation, we will work, we will pray, and we will fight for the day when every family across our land can live in a drug-free America. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you."
