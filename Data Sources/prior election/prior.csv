00:00:00 - 00:01:08 (68 sec),"Hello, Iowa. It is great to be back in beautiful Council Bluffs with thousands of hard-working, great, great American patriots. Thank you.  This is truly a historic week for America.  And you know what I'm talking about. Of course, yesterday at the White House, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh."
00:01:08 - 00:01:38 (31 sec),"And today, Justice Kavanaugh took his seat alongside of Justice Gorsuch to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom.  And I want to thank our incredible Republican senators for refusing to back down in the face of the Democrats' shameful campaign of political and personal destruction."
00:01:38 - 00:02:30 (52 sec),"I especially want to thank an Iowa legend, whose backbone and leadership made this great victory possible, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a very tough cookie, Chuck Grassley. Thank you, Chuck.  Thank you. Great man. Great person. From the very first minute Brett Kavanaugh was nominated, radical Democrats were on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy -- they wanted to destroy that man, because they want to destroy me, too, but that's OK.  Me, we understand."
00:02:30 - 00:02:56 (26 sec),"Him, how can you do that? They want to destroy everything. That's all they're good at, resisting. Their whole campaign is to resist. Ours is to create.  What the Democrats did to Brett and his beautiful family is a national embarrassment, a national disgrace. You see what's happening and you see where they're coming from."
00:02:56 - 00:03:26 (30 sec),"You see. Including the phony protestors that got paid...  ... and now they want to protest because they didn't get paid yet, and they want their money.  So now they're going to really protest.  You see, that's a real protest. But in just four weeks, you will have the chance to render your verdict on the Democrats' outrageous conduct."
00:03:26 - 00:03:56 (29 sec),"On November 6th -- and you can do early voting in Iowa. Go. Just vote. Get it over with.  Vote. Go vote. Early voting started today. Right? Today. Early vote. Go do it immediately. Then you don't have to listen to me any more tonight.  In fact, if you did early voting already, go home. Have a good time. Thank you."
00:03:56 - 00:04:47 (51 sec),"We'll let some additional people from outside in, right? Nah, that's not going to happen. Got a lot of people outside. Look at this place. You believe it?  It never changes. Could I ask the cameras to just take a swoop of this room, please? Do you mind? Come on.  They don't like to do that. They don't like to -- they like to keep that camera dead set on me and about six people in the background."
00:04:47 - 00:05:10 (23 sec),"All wearing hats saying ""Make Farmers Great Again.""  And we're doing it. I shouldn't -- we're a little bit early. I shouldn't say it now, but we're going with E15 year round, OK?  I made that promise to you during the campaign. I made that promise to you during the primaries. Remember? I made that promise."
00:05:10 - 00:05:43 (34 sec),"Promises made, promises kept.  Right? On November 6th, you have the chance to stop the radical Democrats by electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate. So, we need the votes.  We have a majority that if one person has a cold, we have to hold the vote. I mean, can you -- we don't have -- it's like we hardly have a majority."
00:05:43 - 00:06:06 (23 sec),"We need votes.  Early voting is now underway. And you know that. You got to get out. Early voting, go out now and vote. Leave here now immediately. Is it still open? Yes, get the hell out of here. Early voting.  And in their lust for power, the Democrats have become totally unhinged. They've gone -- they've gone crazy."
00:06:06 - 00:06:49 (43 sec),"No, they've gone crazy. Now the Democrats -- or as some people would says, the Dims -- the Dims -- who says that? Lou Dobbs, the great Lou Dobbs. He says that, right? Sean Hannity says that. The Dims. Sean Hannity.  Judge Jeanine says that, doesn't she?  Laura -- Laura, how good has Laura been, right?  We got a lot of good people."
00:06:49 - 00:07:21 (32 sec),"Do we like -- do we like Tucker? I like Tucker.  He says that a lot. How about Steve Doocy? How about Ainsley, Brian? We got a lot of great friends.  The Democrats are even talking about doing really bad things now to Justice Kavanaugh. You know what they're talking about? And packing the courts with radical judges to overrule the will of the American people."
00:07:21 - 00:08:00 (39 sec),"It's not going to happen, folks. Not going to happen.  Last week, they're saying we'll impeach him. Impeach him for what? For what?  Besides that, I have to go first, right? Don't I have to go...  Even though we've done nothing wrong, other than create one of the greatest economies in the history of our country...  That will be interesting."
00:08:00 - 00:08:42 (42 sec),"You get impeached for having created the greatest economy in the history of our country. The best job numbers in the history of our country, just about, right? The greatest trade deals, which we've just finished, in the history of our country.  The biggest regulatory cuts by far already in less than two years, bigger than any other president during their entire term or terms...  The biggest tax cuts and reforms -- you got a lot of money back -- in the history of our country."
00:08:42 - 00:09:15 (33 sec),"But the Democrats have become too extreme. And they've become, frankly, too dangerous to govern. They've gone wacko.  They've gone so far left that they consider Pocahontas to be a rational person. No, it's crazy. Elizabeth Warren.  Oh, I hope she runs. I hope she runs. Then we can finally get down to the fact as to whether or not she has Indian blood."
00:09:15 - 00:09:41 (27 sec),"So far, she's not doing too well. Her mother says she has high cheekbones. That's why.  And she's gotten a lot of advantages by falsely claiming what she's claiming. So I hope she's one of the finalists. But I don't want to knock too many of them, because maybe by doing I'll knock them all out early and I'll actually end up somebody that's -- like, that's got some talent."
00:09:41 - 00:10:12 (31 sec),"That wouldn't be good. So we have to be nice and quiet.  I should be really quiet, really, really, quite on the bad ones. On the bad ones.  Like, we won't talk about Cory Booker, who ran Newark into the ground.  We won't talk about Da Nang Dick...  ... who tried to convince people for 15 years that he was a great war hero."
00:10:12 - 00:10:33 (21 sec),"They were going down left. They were going down right.  Right, you know who that is? Blumenthal. He said they were going on my left, they were going down -- he was in Da Nang Province. Except the one problem. It's hard to be there, because he was never in Vietnam, but these are minor details.  And then he gets up. He goes, I demand total honesty and transparency."
00:10:33 - 00:10:50 (18 sec),"I'm saying, what's -- he wants honesty. Great war hero. He's a great hero.  Yeah. Right, how about -- how about Senator Feinstein? That's another beauty.  That's a beauty. Did you leak the documents? Well, what, what? No, I didn't do it. Did we leak? Did we leak?  No. No. No, we didn't -- did you ever see -- no, she goes no. He just said, no, we didn't leak."
00:10:50 - 00:11:52 (62 sec),"[Audience chants Lock her up]  And I think they're talking about Feinstein. Can you believe that? Now, was that the worst body language, honestly? In other words, did she leak it? A hundred percent.  No, no, I don't want to get sued. Ninety-nine percent. See, now I can't get sued. Now I can't get sued.  You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob."
00:11:52 - 00:12:26 (33 sec),"And that's what the Democrats are becoming.  They would turn our country so fast into Venezuelan -- and Venezuelan is not doing too well, folks. If you want to drain the swamp, you must defeat the Democrats, so you're going to have one hell of a swamp.  Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving."
00:12:26 - 00:12:52 (26 sec),"And America is winning again like never before, because we are finally putting America first.  The national unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent. You believe that one?  3.7 percent, the lowest in 50 years, five-oh, 50. And it's going better. It's going better. Iowa's unemployment rate is 2.5 percent, among the lowest in its history that we can find."
00:12:52 - 00:13:01 (9 sec),"And by the way, we need people helping you. We need people coming in. We need people to run the farms. We're going to have people coming in. But they're going to come in legally, and they're going to come in through merit, through merit. It's called the merit system. [Audience chants Build the wall]  And we've built the wall -- we're building the wall."
00:13:01 - 00:13:51 (50 sec),"We've started. A lot of it's getting done right now. We got $1.6 billion. Another $1.6 billion. And another $1.6 billion. I want 'em to give us the money so I can build it -- we can build it in a year. But we've done a lot of it. It's going up right now.  But, you know, the Democrats feel that that's one thing we really want, we got our money for the military, $700 billion."
00:13:51 - 00:14:11 (20 sec),"We got our money to help us out with the opioid crisis, $6 billion.  But when it comes to the wall, they feel we want it so badly, but we keep getting big chunks and we keep building that wall. And it's under construction. And we're going to get it finished sooner than anyone would believe. And if you could get me some Republicans, we'll get it done quickly."
00:14:11 - 00:14:34 (24 sec),"Quickly.  I mean, when I have to ask Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters...  ... Maxine Waters, can we build a wall, Maxine? No, I don't want that wall built. She doesn't want a wall built. Can we build it? How about -- how about Pelosi? We want to build a wall. No, I don't want that wall built.  Look, Iowa manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest rate in more than 20 years."
00:14:34 - 00:15:09 (35 sec),"And if you remember...  ... the last administration, without mentioning names, the last administration said manufacturing jobs, they're dead. They're gone. We have 600,000 have come back since the election.  Six hundred thousand. More Americans are now working than ever before. Think of that. At this point today, this day, we have more Americans by far working -- right now working than have ever worked in our country before."
00:15:09 - 00:15:33 (24 sec),"Isn't that great? That's a big number. That's a big number.  Today I kept another major promise, as I said, to the people of Iowa and Nebraska and other countries.  Wait. Hey, wait a minute. I got to do that again. I got to do that again. I love Nebraska. You know we won Iowa, we won Nebraska...  But they said, sir, you're speaking in Iowa, but we'll have some people from Nebraska there."
00:15:33 - 00:15:56 (23 sec),"What the...  Like I said, Nebraska...  OK, so -- and we have both. By the way, we have both great governors here.  And I did that just in case. So, ready? I'm going to go Iowa first, then I'm going to go Nebraska. I just want to see who the hell I'm speaking to.  OK? Because that was a little shocking what I just heard."
00:15:56 - 00:17:09 (73 sec),"So I'm going to go -- I'm just curious, OK? Iowa.  Nebraska.  Unbelievable. So they said, sir, you're speaking in Iowa, there may be a few people coming in from Nebraska. I don't think that's right. Great going, fellas. Great going. I'll tell my staff, great going, fellas.  Doesn't matter. We love both. Who cares, right?"
00:17:09 - 00:17:31 (23 sec),"Who cares? We love 'em.  All I know is you've got a lot of farmers in both, right?  And my administration is protecting ethanol, all right? That's what you want to hear.  Today, we are unleashing the power of E15 to fuel our country all year long. Not eight months. All year long.  The Dems will end ethanol."
00:17:31 - 00:18:33 (61 sec),"You know that. They're not going to approve ethanol. They will take it away as -- we'll try and make it, like, so they can't do it to -- but they will find a way to take it away if you give them rights. You better get out there and vote for Republicans.  We've also achieved another historic victory for Iowa farmers and ranchers, by replacing the job-killing NAFTA with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA."
00:18:33 - 00:19:15 (42 sec),"But if Democrats take control, they will try to reverse our amazing progress and plunge our country into gridlock, frankly, into poverty, ultimately into chaos. That's what's going to happen.  And we've never had it like it's been now. We've never had it like it is now. Look at all the money you people are making."
00:19:15 - 00:19:45 (30 sec),"What are you going to do with it?  Democrats want to raise your taxes, impose socialism, dismantle law enforcement...  ... eliminate ICE...  ... and get rid of American borders. You want to get rid of the borders, right? You won't have a country.  And I've been saying this, and I mean it. Democrats are the party of crime."
00:19:45 - 00:19:59 (14 sec),"They are. Republicans are the party of safety. We are also the party of jobs, jobs, jobs.  Now, we're thrilled to be joined tonight by a number of terrific Republican leaders. Iowa Congressman Steve King...  Where's Steve? Where is he? Where is Steve? Where is he? I wish he could get a little bit more conservative."
00:19:59 - 00:20:22 (23 sec),"Can you believe this guy? He may be -- we're all -- he may be the world's most conservative human being.  Thank you, Steve.  And I supported him long before I became a politician. Do I have to use that term? Am I a politician?  Thank you, Steve. And another great, great gentleman, so much help to me, Congressman Jeff Fortenberry."
00:20:22 - 00:20:51 (29 sec),"Thanks, Jeff. Great job. Thank you. They're always with us. They are -- those two, always with us.  Another friend of mine, got to know him during the primaries, got to know him during the election. We took this state by storm. He helped. But I did even better than him. You know, you still need a -- you still need a product, right?"
00:20:51 - 00:21:18 (27 sec),"But we did great. And we love the people of Iowa. We took Nebraska equally.  By a lot. By a lot. That wasn't close. Iowa GOP Chair -- friend of mine -- Jeff Kaufmann. Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. Great job, Jeff. Get ready, Jeff. We're coming back soon, Jeff. And from Nebraska...  ... where's Tom Osborne, huh?"
00:21:18 - 00:22:04 (46 sec),"Where is he? Where's Tom Osborne?  And I don't know Tom Osborne. All I know -- it's ""Tom Osborne,"" right? All I know is for years all he knew how to do is win, win, just win.  I mean, how good a coach was that guy? You know, there's a guy -- again, I don't know him, never met him. But it's called no talk, all action."
00:22:04 - 00:22:27 (24 sec),"Isn't that nice?  Now, what you did every year, you won. Better get going, Nebraska.  But we have a governor who's done a fantastic job. He's so into so many different things, including cutting your taxes, and we have him with us, Governor Pete Ricketts. Pete?  Great guy. Great. I think they like you, Pete."
00:22:27 - 00:22:43 (16 sec),"Vote for Ricketts. That's November. Right? Vote for Ricketts. He's got an opponent that doesn't have what you need, but still you never know. You got to get out there and vote, right, Pete? You have a vote. Great job, Pete.  And Congressman Don Bacon...  Incredible guy. Great job, Don. He's always there."
00:22:43 - 00:23:07 (24 sec),"He's always there, Don Bacon. He's always there. Thank you, Don. Great job. Appreciate it. Every time we needed him, he's there. Thank you.  And Nebraska GOP Chair Dan Welch. Thank you, Dan. Thanks, Dan. What a great group. And I am especially thrilled to introduce a person just to come up for a second to say a couple of words, because she has become a real star in the Republican Party and in politics."
00:23:07 - 00:23:37 (30 sec),"Kim Reynolds, she fights every day for the people of Iowa. And she always delivers and -- wow, does she have my endorsement. She's incredible. Kim, please come up. Kim Reynolds.  Kim Reynolds."
00:23:37 - 00:24:15 (37 sec),"Thank you so much. Oh, my gosh! This is amazing! Thank you all for being here! This is incredible! Welcome back, Mr. President, to the great state of Iowa. And on behalf of all Iowans, I want to say thank you, thank you for cutting taxes for hard-working Iowans, for eliminating senseless regulations that stifled innovation and jobs, for standing strong with Justice Kavanaugh and appointing conservative judges to the court!"
00:24:15 - 00:24:50 (35 sec),"Thank you. Thank you for USMCA and for KORUS. And, Mr. President, thank you for year-round E15! Our farmers thank you. Iowans thank you. And we are grateful. Promises made, promises kept. The Midwest has a partner in the White House with President Donald Trump. Woo! It is an incredible honor to serve as the 43rd governor of this great state."
00:24:50 - 00:25:14 (24 sec),"And my story is the Iowa story. It's a reflection of the opportunities that exist here, where a small-town girl, daughter of a factory worker and farmer, who waited tables, checked groceries, never gave up on her dream of getting a college degree, is standing before you today as the first female governor of the state of Iowa."
00:25:14 - 00:25:37 (22 sec),"I understand the challenges that everyday Iowans have faced because I've faced them myself. And that's why I'm proud that we focused on cutting taxes, expanding and growing jobs and wages and opportunities, addressing Iowa's health care needs and creating strong and safe communities. Iowa is working. The Midwest is working."
00:25:37 - 00:26:24 (48 sec),"And we're getting things done. We're recognized as the number-one state in the country, second lowest unemployment, third best managed, wages are going up, taxes are going down. Our budget is balanced. And we're going to keep Iowa moving. We need your help. We need -- Republicans need your help. We need your support."
00:26:24 - 00:26:56 (31 sec),"And to do that, we have to show up. We have to go vote. And if you do that, I promise you, Republicans up and down this ticket are going to be a partner for our great president, to keep the Midwest and moving forward and to keep the United States of America number one! God bless you! God bless the great state of Iowa and the United States of America!"
00:26:56 - 00:27:18 (22 sec),"Wow. Good energy. That's what you need, good energy. Thank you, Kim. Great. By the way, Kim's opponent this November is a radical Dem named Fred Hubbell. He's got some problems. He's weak on crime, weak on borders, doesn't want any. Only wants to massively raise your taxes. He wants to take away your ethanol."
00:27:18 - 00:27:46 (28 sec),"What I'm giving you, he will take, very quickly. Wants to devastate your farms and businesses with an avalanche of job-killing regulations that we just got rid of. Everybody get out and vote for Governor Reynolds on Election Day. Finally, I want to introduce another great Iowa Republican, Congressman David Young."
00:27:46 - 00:28:15 (29 sec),"When you said, David -- he's a great guy -- he's another one, fellas, he's with us, he's with us all the way -- when you said, David, to Congress you voted to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, tax care of our veterans -- our veterans, we love 'em. Veterans' choice. We got veterans' choice. After 44 years, we got veterans' choice."
00:28:15 - 00:28:33 (18 sec),"He voted -- thank you very much. He voted to secure our borders, stop the visa lottery horror show. Can you imagine it? This is legislation. They put names in a bin. We picked names. Do you think we're -- they're putting their finest? We get these people -- a lottery, can you believe? We want a merit system."
00:28:33 - 00:29:03 (31 sec),"We don't want a lottery system. We want a merit system. And we're going to get it. And we're on our way to getting it. Need a few more votes. We got to get some Republicans. And he voted -- and he -- believe this is somebody -- he's not into the American military, but we are. We are really into the American rebuilt military."
00:29:03 - 00:29:40 (37 sec),"But David is a true champion of the military. He loves our military. He loves our vets. David, get on up here, David. Come up. Come here. Remember this. A vote for David is a vote for me and our agenda to make America great again. David, come up."
00:29:40 - 00:30:06 (25 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Wow. This is incredible. Thank you for showing up tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. It's such a pleasure to have you in Iowa. For years, presidents have made promises about E15 year round. We've got a president who delivered, and he did it. Thank you for keeping your promise, Mr. President."
00:30:06 - 00:30:45 (39 sec),"Yeah! Look at the economy, 4.2 percent growth, 3.7 percent unemployment rate across the country, 2.5 percent unemployment rate here. Incredible things are happening, folks. Allowing hard-working Iowans to keep their hard-earned dollars. Opportunity, the American dream. Thank you, Mr. President. Rebuilding our military and signing into law the largest pay increase for our military in almost 10 years."
00:30:45 - 00:31:26 (41 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Securing our border, Mr. President. Thank you. And thank you for getting us out of that bogus Iran deal. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Mr. President, for finally moving our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in Israel. And, Mr. President, you are looking out for veterans."
00:31:26 - 00:32:26 (60 sec),"Thank you for that. Hey, folks. Elections are about choices, right? We can keep moving forward, or we can allow Nancy Pelosi and her hand... and her hand-picked candidates to take us backwards. We cannot go backwards to higher taxes, more government, a weaker military, and the failed policies of the past."
00:32:26 - 00:32:47 (21 sec),"I need your support. We need your support. Talk to your friends. November 6th. Vote. Go to davidyoungforiowa.com to volunteer. Thank you, Mr. President. God bless you. God bless this great country. God bless Iowa. God bless you."
00:32:47 - 00:33:13 (26 sec),"Thank you, David. A vote for David's far-left opponent, Cindy ""Tax Me""... Remember that name, Cindy ""Tax Me"". It's a very good name, actually, for her. I guess it's actually Axne. But we call her ""Tax Ne"". That was so easy. I didn't hear that one, but I don't know if anyone's thought of it, but that's like a natural."
00:33:13 - 00:33:51 (38 sec),"Is a vote for the radical agenda of Pelosi and Schumer and, of course, Maxine Waters. ""Tax Me"" opposed our massive tax cuts. That's why her name. She was born with the right name. And she wants a socialist takeover of health care, which is going to destroy our entire city. Cindy Axne is totally controlled by Pelosi and the extreme Washington liberals who are bankrolling her campaign, totally bankrolling her campaign."
00:33:51 - 00:34:14 (23 sec),"If you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming -- can you believe this -- the speaker of the House? Then you need to vote for David Young, who is a terrific, terrific guy. Terrific guy. And you also need to vote for a great friend of mine, who really through just force of will got us to put up millions of dollars to build a dam to stop your flooding in a very important part of Iowa, Congressman Rod Blum."
00:34:14 - 00:34:58 (44 sec),"Great guy. And I have to say, Rod is fighting to reform welfare, reduce crime, and continuously cut your taxes. Rod's opponent, Abby Finkenauer -- who the hell is that? Who is that? Is an extreme liberal who supports mass amnesty. Anybody like amnesty? For illegal aliens, wants to raise your taxes through the roof, and wants to take away your health care."
00:34:58 - 00:35:32 (34 sec),"So you got to vote for Rod Blum. Got to vote for David Young. You've got to vote for these two characters over here who have been there. We don't even bring them up, because they're leading by so much, I said, I'm not going to waste your time. But get out and vote anyway, just in case, right? Just in -- you never know."
00:35:32 - 00:35:57 (25 sec),You never know. A majority of House Democrats have already signed up for a socialist health care plan that would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for 20 million seniors. Republicans want to protect Medicare. We're protecting it for our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it all of their lives.
00:35:57 - 00:36:26 (28 sec),"Right? And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We are going to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. The Democrat agenda is radical socialism and open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. What a great idea. You know why? Because the people that work for ICE, they love our country."
00:36:26 - 00:37:06 (41 sec),"But they're very tough people. Guess what? That's what we need to take care of MS-13, all the gangs. You don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. Even you don't want to do it. I don't want to do it, either. They're fantastic people. They love our country. And to them, it's a day in the office. For other people, they want no part of it. They want to turn America, these Democrats -- and that's what they want -- into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and the MS-13 killers... that we're getting out of the country, by the way, by the thousands."
00:37:06 - 00:37:44 (38 sec),"Thousands. They've taken over towns in Long Island. I mean, literally. It could happen to your community. They've taken over towns in Long Island. And we go in, and we, like, liberate the towns. Can you believe -- towns that I grew up right next to. I know every one of them. And they go in and they go in and they have no fear and they take care of the situation, they get them the hell out of there or they put them in jail."
00:37:44 - 00:38:01 (17 sec),"They either send them back where they came from or they put them in jail. And they liberate -- literally, can you imagine we're saying this about places in our country? They liberate towns and small cities in different places of Long Island and others. They liberate them, like we're taking over a war and we get liberated."
00:38:01 - 00:38:31 (29 sec),"How sad. How pathetic. And if we didn't have ICE, it wouldn't happen. It wouldn't happen. So we have to cherish our law enforcement. We have to protect our law enforcement. The Democrat immigration policies aren't just wrong, they're lethal. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens that sneak into our country."
00:38:31 - 00:39:13 (42 sec),"And Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE and Border Patrol and our great law enforcement, including your great local law enforcement. If you want to have safe communities, if you want to have a border, then you must organize. Remember this. You don't have a border, you don't have a country, folks, OK, let's face it. Let's face it. You know, we're doing things that are incredible outside, but things are happening you won't even -- you'll see."
00:39:13 - 00:39:45 (32 sec),"You'll see what happens. You take a look at what's going on with North Korea. They were ready to go to war with North Korea. Now we're getting along very nicely. It's working out very well. Look at Iran. Before I got there, Iran was going to take over the Middle East in like 12 minutes, right? Now they're trying to survive."
00:39:45 - 00:40:09 (24 sec),"You got riots in every city. So if you want to really just keep up what we're doing and keep this country -- we have tremendous potential. You know, we're doing well. But we have tremendous potential to grow incredibly. When we get rid of these horrible, disgusting trade deals, with China, over the last five, six years, we've been losing $300 billion to $500 billion a year, billion."
00:40:09 - 00:40:34 (25 sec),"Nobody even knows what the hell it is, it's so much. It's ending. It's ending. It's ending. And it's not just China. It's not just China. And what we do is we protect wealthy countries for nothing. For nothing. Would you say Saudi Arabia is wealthy? Yeah. Right? And I said to the king, you've got to pay."
00:40:34 - 00:41:07 (32 sec),"I'm sorry. You've got to pay. We're going to protect, you've got to pay. Get the money. You've got to pay. You've got to pay! I have friends in the audience, they're good businessmen. They're looking like, absolutely. They -- but you're not a politician. A politician doesn't -- you got to pay. Japan is an immensely wealthy country."
00:41:07 - 00:41:37 (30 sec),"Great people. Prime Minister Abe just had a big election, won by a landslide. He's a friend of mine. But I said, look, we're protecting Japan. They're making a fortune. They're sending us millions of cars. We're not allowed to send them -- they have barriers. We can't send them cars. But they send millions of cars into here."
00:41:37 - 00:42:18 (41 sec),"They pay essentially no tax. And we subsidize their military. When I say subsidize, I'm not talking about like for 2 percent. We pay for 70 percent of their military. Nobody knows this! And I said to the prime minister, who's a great guy, I said, how come? And he honestly says, nobody ever asked. When we straighten out this, we have so much potential."
00:42:18 - 00:42:40 (22 sec),"And there are many countries like that. I'm not looking at just those two. There are many, many countries like that. And you know what? We should protect people that can't protect themselves and they're getting slaughtered. It's OK. It's OK. That's OK. And we're now building by far the strongest military that we've ever had."
00:42:40 - 00:43:17 (38 sec),"And the reason is... And the reason is that when you have the strongest military ever in the history of this world, nobody's going to mess with you. These big guys know it over here. These people know it. I don't want to use our military. But this is a very dangerous world. This is a sick world, in many ways, OK? It's a very, very -- I mean, I see things as president that you don't want to know about."
00:43:17 - 00:43:39 (22 sec),"The things that I see, you don't want to know about. We have to be on guard for some really treacherous people that are running some places -- and we are so prepared you have no idea. We are so prepared. We are so prepared. Because this election is about security. And it's also about prosperity. Since the election... [Audience member calls out Seal Team Six] SEAL Team is right."
00:43:39 - 00:44:08 (29 sec),"Who's SEAL team? The good-looking guy over there, that's good. SEAL Team, they're great. But since the election, we've created -- nobody believes this. If I would have said this when I came to Iowa many times or when I came to Nebraska many times... With your governor, with your governor, if I would have said that we would create 4.2 million new jobs, the fake news media -- look at this, it's like the Academy Awards back there... Look."
00:44:08 - 00:44:32 (24 sec),"The fake news would have said, oh, what he's saying, oh, it's -- oh -- well, guess what? We created 4.2 million jobs just since the election. And... We lifted over 4 million people off of food stamps. How good is that? We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:44:32 - 00:45:07 (35 sec),"And African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. And Kanye West, who gets it... And Big Jim Brown, how do you think he'd do in the NFL today? Bum, the greatest. But they're coming over to the White House very shortly. We're going to have a little lunch and talk about it. But they get it! How do you -- how do you win when you hear those numbers?"
00:45:07 - 00:45:37 (30 sec),"Because the Democrats for 100 years have been promising African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asians. They've been promising everything, nothing happens. Here we are, less than two years, the best employment numbers, the best numbers they've ever had in virtually every category. Every category. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment rates have also reached all-time lows."
00:45:37 - 00:46:05 (28 sec),"How do you -- how do you beat us in 2020? Governor, do you have any idea? What would you say? What would you say? We're going to do a great job. But, yeah, but we have the best numbers ever recorded. Those debates I look forward to. See, I said we were going to do that. Remember? What the hell do you have to lose?"
00:46:05 - 00:46:36 (32 sec),Remember that? Right? I said we were going to do it. But now we've done it. So how's somebody going to do better? But we're going to do much better than even that. Women's unemployment rate just fell to 3.6 percent. Which is the lowest in more than 65 years. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning.
00:46:36 - 00:47:28 (51 sec),"We have finalized a new fair trade deal for South Korea. They don't even talk about -- that's a big deal. We just did a deal, manufacturers, farmers. The deal was so bad. That was a Hillary Clinton deal. She said -- no, no. She was secretary of state. [Audience chants Lock her up] She made a statement today, they're doing a tour, her and her husband or something."
00:47:28 - 00:47:51 (23 sec),"And she made a statement, some ridiculous -- I said, well, that's why she lost the election. She just doesn't get it. She's never gotten it. But she never got it -- so she said, we will create 250,000 jobs. And everybody was excited. Unfortunately, she was right, but it was created in South Korea, not in our country."
00:47:51 - 00:48:35 (44 sec),"Just another deal, check it off. Just another horrible deal. We will create 250,000 for -- you know if she said for South Korea, at least it would have been honest, right? But we've totally renegotiated that. Under the guise of massive tariffs -- I said, if you're not going to do it, we're just going to put tariffs in, that's it. And they said, let's do it. Come on. Let's do it. Let's make a decent deal."
00:48:35 - 00:49:13 (38 sec),"And we've opened it up for your farmers, for your manufacturers. We've taken a horrible deal and made it a good deal. Made it a good deal. And now we're opening up or we're going to do something where we do even better, but we're going to open up Japan for trade and the European Union, which is brutal. They are brutal."
00:49:13 - 00:50:08 (55 sec),"Sounds so nice. So nice. The European Union. Sounds so nice, right? They are brutal. But that's because they've had their way. They formed in order to take advantage of us on trade. Now, we protect most of those countries. European Union, NATO. We protect most. So Germany is paying 1 percent. We are paying 4.3 percent to protect Europe."
00:50:08 - 00:50:32 (24 sec),"Explain that one to me, OK, please? The numbers are horrific. But I've gotten $44 billion last year, more paid into NATO by other countries. And this year will be more than that. That's why I say, our country has such incredible potential. There's so many -- I mean, I could go through deal -- I could go through so many things, just the same thing."
00:50:32 - 00:51:08 (36 sec),"They were going to build the embassy in Israel. As you know, we got approved, right? On my desk was a document to get ready to spend over $1 billion to build a building. I said, how do you spend $1 billion to build a building? I didn't look, but probably like one story, it's an embassy, right, two stories, a billion dollars."
00:51:08 - 00:52:00 (52 sec),"And I said, maybe we can get a building and renovate it and fix it up real fast, and who knows? And our great -- our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, called. He said, you know, we have the best site in Jerusalem. And there's a beautiful building on it. And we can take just a big corner of that building, fix it up, and instead of waiting 20 or 25 years, by the time this thing got worked out, we could have it in about four months, sir."
00:52:00 - 00:52:29 (29 sec),"I said, what do you mean the site's the best? He said, well, we were there early. We've had the site for many years. The building is good, but, you know, we have to renovate. So we're going to spend a billion and probably never get it open, right? And, by the way, had we spent a billion, it would end up costing $3 billion or $4 billion for -- you know, people would look at it, probably one-third the size of this room."
00:52:29 - 00:53:03 (34 sec),"They'll spend $2 billion. So I said, David, how much is it going to cost to do that? And how good is the site? Site's great. And, sir, the building is set way back, which is good for purposes of security. They like that. They don't want it right on the sidewalk. I can't imagine why. Set way back. He said, sir, it's beautiful."
00:53:03 - 00:53:42 (39 sec),"And it's a big site. We can do other things later. I said, how much is it going to cost? He said, sir, it's going to cost about $180,000. I told him, we'll think about it. True, $180,000. First time in my life I've ever done this. First time. Don't get angry at me. I said, David, it's too cheap. It doesn't sound good."
00:53:42 - 00:54:03 (21 sec),"I never did that before. I never did it before. Like, I like to say, like Air Force One, we gave out the contract. They were going to give it out for $1.6 billion more than I gave it out for. They'll tell you. I said to Boeing, I'm not going to pay that price. And I said, I'm not paying it. Cancel the contract."
00:54:03 - 00:54:33 (29 sec),"I'm not paying it. And I held a line. I said, you got to take off $1.8 billion. They called back a day later. Supposing we took off $1.6 billion? I said you have a deal, OK. I actually did that. I actually said cut it in half, OK? But we don't have to go through the whole deal. But with the -- with the -- with the embassy, I said, David, David, $180,000, it's too cheap."
00:54:33 - 00:54:55 (22 sec),"We've got to spend more than that. It doesn't sound good. But, sir, I can do a really -- I said, I know you can, but it's not going to play well. You mean we took it from $1 billion to $180,000? I said, David, I said, you know what, David, make it $400,000. And use Jerusalem stone. Did anybody ever see it? It's the most beautiful stone."
00:54:55 - 00:55:13 (18 sec),"And you're in Jerusalem, right? I mean, what's -- probably inexpensive. Most expensive stone when you bring it here. But you're in Jerusalem. They should have plenty of it, right? I said, David, use beautiful Jerusalem stone and let's do it. We opened it up four months later for $400,000. Can you believe it? Open."
00:55:13 - 00:55:41 (28 sec),"It's open. I could tell you many of these stories. I could tell you many. I could tell you so many of these stories. There's that story, and I got 30 more we could take about. The way we spend -- he says I want to hear more. Should I give you one more of those stories? All right. All right, one story. So we like South Korea."
00:55:41 - 00:56:21 (40 sec),"We've got 32,000 soldiers over there. Thank you very much, United States. They don't pay. They don't pay us, but that's OK. They're very successful. And the Obama administration gave this incredible -- it's all right. Don't worry. It's being mostly dismantled. Mostly dismantled. So my first week in office, I get there, and I notice there's this incredible THAAD system, THAAD system to knock down rockets."
00:56:21 - 00:56:49 (28 sec),"Shoots down rockets, shoots down missiles, most incredible thing you've ever seen. I think they got like a 97 percent shot at it. And the company likes to say, but if you send up two missiles, you get it 100 percent. But that's expensive. I said, do it with one, right? So I get there, and brand new, they put in. I said, just out of curiosity, who pays for it? I said to a certain general, good guy, but, you know, he's not into business."
00:56:49 - 00:57:11 (21 sec),"He's into winning wars, but they're not into business. They don't care. OK. He's into winning, but not into business. He's got a little business, too. So I said, so, let me ask you something. How much does that system cost? Sir, I don't know. As a businessman, you, by the way, a good businessman, you know what I'm talking about."
00:57:11 - 00:57:29 (18 sec),"How much does that cost? Sir, I don't know. Who pays for it? Sir, I don't know. Now, you got to understand, the purpose of this -- it's on the border. This is in the time when we were having a little problem, you know, at the beginning. A lot of people thought we were going to war, but we're doing nicely now."
00:57:29 - 00:57:51 (22 sec),"But I said, so let me get this -- we have a system that's very expensive. And we shoot down rockets that are shot from North Korea to South Korea to shoot down -- OK, so we're protecting South Korea, right? Why aren't they paying? Well, I don't know. I don't -- I said, General, immediately go and find out who's paying for it and how much."
00:57:51 - 00:58:39 (48 sec),"So he goes, next morning, he comes into my office. Sir, we are an ally of South Korea. And therefore, we are paying for the system, sir. I said, I thought so. Then I said, all right, give me the bad news. Raytheon. Give me the bad news. How much is it going to cost? Sir, $1 billion. I said, whoa, whoa! So we're putting in a system that we pay for and it's going to cost $1 billion in order to protect an immensely wealthy country that makes all of your television sets, right?"
00:58:39 - 00:59:22 (42 sec),"Samsung, LG, I order a lot of them, South Korea. And I'm trying to figure that out, Steve King, as a true conservative, but I'm trying to figure it out. So we do this, and I said, do me a favor. Go back to the country. Renegotiate that deal. That's not a good deal. But, sir, the Obama administration has already agreed to it. I said I don't care if they agreed to it. I couldn't care less if they agreed to it. I don't care."
00:59:22 - 00:59:57 (35 sec),"So that's the second or third story. I could go on all night, but I want to get the hell out of here, OK? Because I thought I was coming to Iowa, and there's more people from Nebraska. Right, Pete Ricketts? Pete Ricketts. Governor Ricketts. We love you both. We love you both. After years of rebuilding other nations, I could give you 30 stories."
00:59:57 - 01:00:26 (29 sec),"I -- I could give you 100 stories like that -- we're finally rebuilding our nation. That's what we're doing. America is not being taken advantage of anymore. America is being respected again. With Republicans in Congress, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. Big numbers."
01:00:26 - 01:01:02 (36 sec),"So important for the farmers and small business. To save your family farms and ranches, we've virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. So now if you like your children or love your children, you can leave your beautiful farm to your children and they won't have to pay any taxes. They won't have to go to your local banker, borrow money, and end up losing the farm, which was happening."
01:01:02 - 01:01:22 (20 sec),"Now you won't have any -- you guys know that, that's a big deal -- that's a big deal, Jeff and Steve and everybody. That's a big deal, because people were leaving their farms, they go out, they mortgage their farms, then they end up -- the kids end up going through hell and losing their farms. So now you won't have to go to the bank, borrow money, put a mortgage on. But here's the thing."
01:01:22 - 01:01:46 (24 sec),"If you don't like your kids, or if you don't love your kids, it doesn't have any impact on you. Sell the farm. Enjoy yourselves and relax. Don't give them anything. Don't give them anything if you don't like them. Don't give them anything! We're reducing the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients access life-saving treatment we passed."
01:01:46 - 01:02:10 (24 sec),"And right to try. Right to try. We all know what it is. We have right to try now. For years, people wanted to access some of these cures that worked, but they can't get approved, because it's a long process which we've cut way down. Right to try. They were terminally ill and they couldn't get treatment of something that may work."
01:02:10 - 01:02:33 (23 sec),"We just signed right to try. And these guys helped a lot, right? Steve, Jeff, everybody. They helped a lot. David was great, David Young. So now you get the right to try. People used to travel all over the world if they had money. If they didn't have money, they'd go home. They had no hope. Now they can get treatment."
01:02:33 - 01:03:05 (32 sec),"They sign a document, they can get treatment. They tried for 40 years to get that passed. We got it passed. Right to try. I love it. We also passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. Big thing. Forty-four years. Forty-four years, they've tried to get it passed. People are waiting on line for 12 days, for 20 days, for 28 days."
01:03:05 - 01:03:32 (27 sec),"People aren't that sick. By the time they see the doctor, seriously, they're terminally ill. They couldn't see a doctor. Now we have the right to let them go see a private doctor. We pay for the bills. It's great for them. It actually is saving for us. Forty-four years. Forty-four years. Forty-four years."
01:03:32 - 01:03:53 (20 sec),"I thought it was my idea, but then I came back and I said -- what a great idea. They said, we've been trying to get it passed for 44 years. I mean, how simple? Right? Forty-four years. But because of guys like this, right, Steve, Jeff, everybody, Governor, you were incredible, Pete Ricketts. You helped so much."
01:03:53 - 01:04:19 (27 sec),"All of you guys. And the landmark V.A. accountability law. You couldn't fire anybody. There were -- literally, there were sadists working for the V.A. There were bad people. There were thieves. Horrible people. You couldn't fire them. We passed -- I think it's 46, 47 years. Look, I hate to say it. Union problems."
01:04:19 - 01:04:38 (19 sec),"All sorts of problems. Civil service problems. Pretty strong lobby, right? We got it passed, 44, 46 years. And now when we catch people that aren't taking care of our veterans, we look at them, we say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here! It's true. It's true. [Audience chants Trump] Now, you know, they don't spin the cameras."
01:04:38 - 01:05:09 (30 sec),"Tell this -- I said in the beginning to spin. Nobody does it. Because they don't want to show how big these crowds are. They -- no, I'm telling you. They don't want to show it. They don't want to show it. Look, they're not spinning. Do you see one camera turning? No, they don't want to show all these people."
01:05:09 - 01:05:49 (40 sec),"They don't want to show it. I don't see -- look, I don't see one camera turning. They don't want to show them. Our great first lady -- I come home, I said, did they show the crowd? No, but it sounded massive. Right? It sounded -- sounded -- looks like an Iowa -- Iowa state or Nebraska football game. That's what it sounds like."
01:05:49 - 01:06:16 (28 sec),"That's what it sounds like. Right? That's what it sounds like. So my wife would say, they didn't show the crowd, but it sure as hell sounded big. You know, when you have crowds like this, you can't cheat on the sound. I mean, it's a lot of people. But they cheat, because they -- they never show the crowd."
01:06:16 - 01:06:51 (35 sec),"We secured... $716 billion to fully rebuild our great American military. And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Air Force, the Space Force. Very important. Very important. We got to get that done, Congressman. Everybody wants that. So important. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
01:06:51 - 01:07:18 (27 sec),"They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Iowa and Nebraska. And we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. [Audience chants USA] And, by the way, speaking of the NFL... No, it's OK. But you know, for years, the NFL had a big problem with Canada and the Super Bowl and rights."
01:07:18 - 01:08:13 (55 sec),"It's a complicated thing, but it doesn't matter. And I heard about the problem. And we were dealing with them on a much, much, much bigger issue. And the NFL is a great American company. And I told my people, give the damn NFL problem solved. It took them about two minutes. And I got a call from the commissioner."
01:08:13 - 01:08:36 (23 sec),"I thought he was calling about the flag. I thought he was calling to say we have fully agreed that we are all going to stand at attention with our hand on our heart, helmet on the ground, and salute -- he didn't. But a good guy. He called me to thank me. You know why I did that? I did that -- nobody told me to do it. I did that because I knew they had a problem."
01:08:36 - 01:08:53 (17 sec),"And it's a great American company. Whether we like it, don't like it, doesn't matter. It's a great American company. And so I got it done. I got it done. Took us like two minutes. And you know what? Now the players will be paid more money and they'll still hate me. Isn't that terrible? They'll still hate Trump."
01:08:53 - 01:09:24 (31 sec),"And they get more money. But that's OK. That's why -- that's why guys like Jim Brown and Kanye and so many others like me. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote or early voting. Get out and vote or early voting."
01:09:24 - 01:09:56 (32 sec),"Vote for Governor Kim Reynolds. Vote -- I thought you were coming here as my guest. Pete, I thought you were coming here -- just today -- come on over, Pete. Vote for Pete Ricketts. I didn't know you were bringing half of Nebraska, Pete. Vote for Congressman Rod Blum and Congressman David Young. Don't bother with these two guys."
01:09:56 - 01:10:31 (35 sec),"They're going to win by -- vote for them, too, please. Vote for them, too. That's right, Steve. They're going to vote for you guys. Thank you. And thank you. Vote for Republicans. You're doing the right thing, because a vote for us is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products that are made right here in the USA."
01:10:31 - 01:11:07 (36 sec),"That's what we're doing. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division, and destruction. And you know what else? You know what else? And weakness, because it's weakness."
01:11:07 - 01:11:32 (25 sec),"And to reclaim our magnificent destiny as Americans. To everyone in this great room tonight, to every citizen watching across our land -- and there are a lot of them -- this is your time to choose. So important. Got to get out. You've got to vote. It will all be taken away if they get control, including -- they'll start appointing Supreme Court judges that you will not want."
01:11:32 - 01:12:04 (32 sec),"We'll have justices that you will say, how did this happen? You got to get out and vote. It's time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. Never forget that in 2016 we had the greatest movement in the history of our country."
01:12:04 - 01:12:40 (36 sec),"And they won't challenge that. They even admit that. They're not happy about it. They're not happy. But that was the greatest movement in the history of our country. It is not up to the media or the fake news or the pundits to decide your fate. It is up to you. You have the power. With your vote, you can do so much, but you can defend your family, defend your community, defend your country, defend your rights, your faith, and your dignity."
01:12:40 - 01:13:22 (42 sec),"Loyal citizens like you, Iowa and Nebraska, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power back to the American patriots, which is you. These states were settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women. The women actually were stronger than men, but I don't want to get into that."
01:13:22 - 01:13:44 (22 sec),"I don't want to get into that! The women are stronger than the men. I've said it for a long time. Sorry, men. Sorry, you guys. You know what I'm talking about, right? They're all nodding. You're right. Who have braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home right here. They didn't have a lot of money."
01:13:44 - 01:14:19 (35 sec),"They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They loved their families. They loved their country. And they loved their God. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage."
01:14:19 - 01:14:54 (35 sec),"For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory."
01:14:54 - 01:15:48 (54 sec),"Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you, Nebraska. Thank you. Get out and vote."
00:00:00 - 00:00:53 (54 sec),"Hello, Pennsylvania. Hello, Pennsylvania. Great people. Incredible people. And I'm thrilled to be here tonight in Erie, Pennsylvania, with thousands of loyal, hard-working, and beautiful American patriots. That's what you are. Before we begin, I want to send our thoughts and prayers of our entire nation to everyone in the path of Hurricane Michael, especially in the Florida panhandle, where it's hitting and hitting hard."
00:00:53 - 00:01:29 (35 sec),"It's a big one, one of the biggest we've ever seen. All of Pennsylvania, all of America sends its unwavering love and support. My administration is working closely with Florida Governor Rick Scott and the governors of North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, anybody else affected, to provide the full resources and steadfast support of our federal government."
00:01:29 - 00:02:00 (31 sec),"We are... We're all set to go. We're going to follow it right in. We have massive amounts of water and food. And we have the electric companies, thousands and thousands of electrical workers, they're going to follow it as it leaves. We're going to follow right behind. Help the situation. Everyone's working in close coordination with local officials."
00:02:00 - 00:02:32 (32 sec),"And I'll be traveling to Florida very, very shortly, so we just want to wish them all the best. And Godspeed. Godspeed. God bless you all. And you know -- and I speak because so many of my friends are here with us in Pennsylvania, we will spare no effort, no expense, no resource to help these great fellow citizens of ours that are going through a tough time right now."
00:02:32 - 00:03:15 (42 sec),"We know when Americans face hardship, we support each other, we stand with each other, we care for each other, and we will always pull through. It will be successful. We will always be successful at what we do. Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, again, two weeks ago, and now they're going to get a lot more water coming in. That's what they don't need is water right now."
00:03:15 - 00:03:49 (35 sec),"These are great people. Tonight we are going to discuss the extraordinary achievements we've made for our fellow citizens in less than two years' time. You know, it's been less than two years. All those beautiful red hats, Make America Great Again... And we will discuss the next steps we must take to protect this amazing progress and to continue building an even greater future for all Americans."
00:03:49 - 00:04:32 (43 sec),"That's what's happening. You look at what's going on. It's been incredible. I said the other night -- and you know that these folks will dispute us if we're wrong. But this has been the greatest revolution ever to take place in our country. Here we are. The greatest ever. I remember, during the primaries and prior to the election, they were saying, wow, this is -- this is something not -- there's been nothing like this since Ronald Reagan."
00:04:32 - 00:04:54 (22 sec),"Then it kept going and going and going, and then we actually won. In Tennessee, I remember a great Congressmen Duncan, they said, he said, sir, early voting. He said, sir, they're coming from the hills, the valleys, people that haven't voted for a long time because they didn't want to vote for the people that were running for office."
00:04:54 - 00:05:33 (39 sec),"And they've got Trump banners and Trump hats and Trump tattoos. I've never seen anything like it. All about you. And he was right. [Audience Chants USA] And then after that, they said, well, we have to go back further than Ronald Reagan, so they talk about Andrew Jackson and said, let's see, the 1830s, that's a long time."
00:05:33 - 00:06:04 (32 sec),"And then they said on election night that this superseded even Andrew Jackson. So you won it. It's yours. And we're doing well. We're doing well. We are producing and doing even better than we said we would. It's been amazing. This election is about your families, your values, and what kind of country you want to leave for your children."
00:06:04 - 00:06:54 (50 sec),"This election is about keeping America safe, keeping America strong, keeping America proud, keeping America free. And this has been a historic week for our nation. And you know what I'm talking about. You know, all my life I've heard that a president's most important decision is who he or she picks for the United States Supreme Court."
00:06:54 - 00:07:41 (47 sec),"And as you know, on Monday night, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh now sits alongside Justice Gorsuch... to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom. Two great men. They will go down as great, great justices of the Supreme Court."
00:07:41 - 00:08:25 (44 sec),"You watch. What the radical Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh and his beautiful family is a national disgrace. It's a disgrace. What they did was a disgrace. You look at Cory Booker, the way he talked, and then you look at what he did. You look at Senator Dianne Feinstein, what she did. The disgraceful behavior."
00:08:25 - 00:09:19 (54 sec),"The disgraceful leaking of documents. You look at what they did. You look at the false charges. You look at the false accusations. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace! And people were saying, thank you, sir, for sticking and thank you for not giving up. You know what? I never even thought of it, folks. I never even thought of it. Never even thought of it. But on November 6th, you can vote to reject the Democrats' shameful conduct by electing Republican House and, really, we need it badly, we need these votes, a Republican Senate."
00:09:19 - 00:10:03 (44 sec),"Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first. Just two days ago, the unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level in 50 years. It was just announced that manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high."
00:10:03 - 00:10:21 (18 sec),"Historic. Big thing, confidence. You remember the previous administration? They said, oh, you can't bring back manufacturing jobs. Really? You can't bring back... That was wrong. Remember they said you'd need a magic wand. Well, we've got -- I guess we have, right -- we have a magic wand. And those are our great jobs."
00:10:21 - 00:11:04 (43 sec),"And we are unleashing the power of Pennsylvania shale and clean, beautiful Pennsylvania coal, beautiful, beautiful, clean coal. We are putting our miners back to work. We are putting our steelworkers back to work. And by the way, I don't know how many people are in the steel industry, but one of the hottest industries -- and this was dying."
00:11:04 - 00:11:33 (29 sec),"The steel industry was dead and dying. One of the hottest industries right now in our country is American steel. U.S. Steel is opening and expanding seven different plants and spending a tremendous -- billions of dollars doing it. And what does it mean for you? Jobs, jobs, very simple. What does it mean for our country?"
00:11:33 - 00:12:05 (32 sec),"What does it mean for our country? We can't lose the steel industry. The steel industry was on its last legs, and now, after four months of really intensely doing what I do... it's thriving. It is thriving. It's amazing, actually. It's amazing. You got to have steel. You know, you need steel for defense."
00:12:05 - 00:12:35 (30 sec),"You got to have steel. Supposing you don't have steel and we do have a problem defense-wise. You going to call China, please send us some steel? And aluminum is doing great again. These are things we have to have. But beyond that, it's tremendous numbers of jobs already taking place. The head of U.S. Steel said he's never seen anything like it. And what did we do? We essentially stopped the dumping."
00:12:35 - 00:13:00 (25 sec),"They were dumping garbage all over our country. It wasn't even good. It was sand steel. It was rotted steel. It was garbage. They're dumping it all over our country. So now we can take our own metallurgic ore out of our mines that we can bring it here and to other places, and we can actually have our industry."
00:13:00 - 00:13:24 (23 sec),"We don't need this product coming in untested from other countries. We don't need it, folks. We've got it here. We don't need it. And you watch what's going to happen with jobs, and you watch what's going to happen with price. Very proud of that industry. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation."
00:13:24 - 00:14:09 (46 sec),"But if Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats... take over Congress, they will try to raise your taxes -- we've lowered them tremendously -- impose socialism, which is where they're coming from... and take over and destroy American health care. And you see how well we're doing with health care. You see it. Democrats want to abolish America's borders and allow drugs and gangs to pour into our country unabated."
00:14:09 - 00:14:51 (42 sec),"And I say this, and I mean this. The Democrats are the party of crime. That's what's happening. They are the party of crime. Republicans are the party of law, order, and justice. And we are also the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. You see that. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by several really terrific friends of mine, Pennsylvania Republicans, including a man that's helped me so much in Washington, like tax cuts, like regulation cuts, like many other things, Congressman GT Thompson."
00:14:51 - 00:15:20 (29 sec),"A man who's really doing well, if you believe in polls. I believe in polls. Only the ones that have us up, because they're the only honest ones. [Laughter] Other than that, they're the fake news poll. Fake news. Fake news. You know they take these polls, they show them, I said, that can't be right. What they want to do is keep you out of the voting booth."
00:15:20 - 00:15:56 (36 sec),"Take your wife, take your husband, go to a movie, come back, watch the results. You say, you know, I love so and so, but the polls say he can't win. Darling, let's go to a movie tonight. We'll go home and we'll watch -- and that's what happens. They talk you out of it. They're dishonest. just like their reporting is dishonest, their polls are dishonest."
00:15:56 - 00:16:18 (22 sec),"Not all of them. Not all of them. No, not all of them. But many of them, and I saw it. I saw it. And yet there were some that got us very right on that great, great evening. Was that the most exciting evening of our lives? Remember, we won Florida? And remember John King, nice guy at CNN, fake news, CNN... Remember, early -- it was early, and we won by a lot."
00:16:18 - 00:16:53 (34 sec),"We won Florida by a lot. Remember the red, right, the red, beautiful red. I never liked red so much. [Laughter] Against the blue, I didn't like blue. [Laughter] And the whole map is like red. And he's going crazy. But early, Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Oh, my gosh. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida."
00:16:53 - 00:17:27 (35 sec),"Oh, that was upsetting to him. Remember when they said that Texas would be long, it would be a long call, go late into the night, because they said it's just going to be too close to call? So the polls closed at 8 o'clock, and they never call them early unless you win by a landslide, right? So the polls closed."
00:17:27 - 00:18:13 (46 sec),"The polls have closed in the state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. Right? Which other one? Utah, remember it was so -- it was so close, Utah. They had a guy that I never saw before. I don't know. There's this guy. Do you know who I'm talking about? And they had crooked Hillary, the three of us. And this guy was supposed to come in second, but I was going to be -- it's going to be very close."
00:18:13 - 00:18:36 (23 sec),"Maybe I could edge, but this guy was going to come either first or second, and crooked Hillary was supposed to be third. So, the Utah, great people. We just gave over millions of acres of great space, public space to Utah. So what happens? What happens? So they say, oh, for weeks I'm hearing how close Utah is. So the polls close at 8 o'clock."
00:18:36 - 00:19:23 (47 sec),"Eight o'clock and three seconds, Donald Trump has won... the state of Utah. We won it by... And on top of that, this guy came in third. He didn't even come in second. Crooked Hillary came in second. A long ways away. Long ways. Remember? Anyway. But was that the most exciting night? Was that the greatest?"
00:19:23 - 00:19:44 (21 sec),"Well, if you look at it, when you think of it, there was collusion between Hillary, the Democrats, and Russia. There was collusion. There's no question about it. There was a lot of collusion with them and Russia and lots of other people, by the way. But so you remember -- so we win Florida, then we had a -- you know, to win the Electoral College is very tough."
00:19:44 - 00:20:04 (20 sec),"The other is easier. You go to three or four states and you work, and you do -- but to win, got to be smart. You're right. You got to be smart. Got to be smart. You got to -- and you have to have great support. This is our support. But you got to run the whole East Coast. If you're a Republican, it's very, very hard."
00:20:04 - 00:20:27 (23 sec),"Electoral College is much harder than anything. Remember, they said, there is no path. I heard this so many times. I said to my wife, oh -- our first lady, how's she doing? Good? I said to Melania, I said, I've heard there is no path, there is no path to 270. Right? How many times have you heard that? Thousands?"
00:20:27 - 00:20:49 (22 sec),"I've been hearing it for months. There is no path. And I kept going -- I love this state -- I kept going to Maine, for one, because they had -- maybe, if I have a great night, 269. Of course they could never say I could get to -- so I kept going to Maine five times, because I wanted to get one, and I ended up getting the one in Maine, but I also got Michigan, and Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania."
00:20:49 - 00:21:20 (31 sec),"Remember that? Remember that? And what angered me, because I love this state, and I went to school in this state, right? I went to school in this state. I love Pennsylvania. I went to school in this state. Great place. Great people. What angered me is Pennsylvania hasn't been won for many years by Republicans, but every Republican thinks they're going to win Pennsylvania."
00:21:20 - 00:21:43 (23 sec),"They didn't quite get it. But I got it. The workers, I got it. Every Republican -- I used an expression. You know, there's an expression, but under the rules of ""Me, Too,"" I'm not allowed to use that expression anymore. Can't do it. [Laughter] It's the person that got away. See, in the old days, it was a little different."
00:21:43 - 00:22:04 (21 sec),"Pennsylvania -- I'll just do it anyway. I would do it, except for these people up there. They would say, did you hear what President Trump said? Did you hear what he said? So there is expression, but we'll change the expression. Pennsylvania was always the person that got away. That's pretty good, right?"
00:22:04 - 00:22:31 (27 sec),"The person that got -- and for many years, nobody -- no Republican won Pennsylvania. And -- but they always thought they were going to. Pennsylvania, great. And then they lost it by a lot. I said I know we're going to win Pennsylvania, but all night long, they had one point. But if I lost every single vote in Pennsylvania, I was 99 percent of the vote cast, and I said, will you please project Pennsylvania?"
00:22:31 - 00:22:56 (25 sec),"Let Pennsylvania be the state where I win this election? I was winning North Carolina, South Carolina. We won Florida. We were doing -- we were running the East Coast. And I kept saying, why aren't they -- and ask them. Ask them. Why aren't they announcing Pennsylvania? One point left, 99 percent of the vote cast, right?"
00:22:56 - 00:23:21 (24 sec),"Ninety-nine percent of the vote cast. One point left. If I lost every single vote, I won Pennsylvania by a lot. I kept saying, why aren't they announcing Pennsylvania? I thought it must be some kind of a technical malfunction. [Laughter] So they didn't do it until late in the evening. It stayed forever. I kept going, why aren't they announcing?"
00:23:21 - 00:24:10 (50 sec),"I'd love to win with Pennsylvania. But honestly, then what happened? Out of the blue, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. And then out of the blue, first time in decades, Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. And then finally they announced, late in the morning, which we knew they just couldn't do it. They couldn't do it. They just couldn't. Donald Trump has won the great state of Pennsylvania."
00:24:10 - 00:24:28 (18 sec),"They didn't do it that way. They didn't do it that way. They didn't do it that way. They did it with tears flowing down their face. This can't be happening. Can this -- did you see some of them crying? And we were all crying, too, out of happiness, right? Because there has never been anything like what we all did."
00:24:28 - 00:24:55 (26 sec),"OK? We did it together. And now we're doing great trade deals. We're fixing our military. We're taking care of our vets. We are doing so much. We're cutting regulations. So you have a congressional candidate running, taking the place of a fantastic person. You know who that is. But you have a man named John Joyce who's running, and he's way up in the polls, but don't let that fool you."
00:24:55 - 00:25:35 (41 sec),"Get out and vote. Get out and vote. John Joyce. Where is John? Thank you, John. State Senators Dan Laughlin and Michele Brooks, and your next governor of the state of Pennsylvania -- I'll tell you, this guy is working hard, folks. He said he did 631 events. I said that's a lot. [Laughter] I'll tell you, he's a really good man and he's a hard-worker, and I know it's a tough race."
00:25:35 - 00:26:10 (35 sec),"But based on competence, based on everything, very successful guy. Successful businessman, which we like. Scott Wagner. Scott? And maybe the best thing I can say about Scott Wagner is that Judge Jeanine thinks he's fantastic, OK? That might be the greatest endorsement. And I -- you have my full endorsement."
00:26:10 - 00:26:37 (27 sec),"That might be the greatest endorsement I can give you, Scott. Judge Jeanine. I'm especially thrilled to introduce a terrific Pennsylvania congressmen. He's been a friend of mine for a long time, long before I did this whole political thing. A congressmen came up to me the other day, he said, sir, I've been winning for many years and I'm a proud congressmen."
00:26:37 - 00:26:58 (20 sec),"I've won many races, 10 to be exact. I've only lost three. I said, you lost three? Yes, a long time ago, when I was young. And I'm very proud, I'm a real professional. I said, you know, I've never thought of it that way, but I've only ran one time, one... It was for the presidency. And we won the presidency, right?"
00:26:58 - 00:27:38 (40 sec),"We won the president. Now, I had to do it, because he was bragging about his political career. This wasn't Mike Kelly, by the way. Somebody else. And I had to do it. I said, I never thought of it that way, but I ran one time, and we won. OK. And it's also the presidency, right? So, you know. But a man that's been a friend of mine for a long time, he's a tremendous man, and his name is Congressmen Mike Kelly."
00:27:38 - 00:28:20 (42 sec),"He loves you people. And just like your other congressmen, and John Joyce, just like your other congressmen, Mike is strong on crime, tough as hell on borders, powerful on trade, and he is really great on jobs. You see what he's doing. Mike was leading the fight, along with JT and the others, in Congress to cut your taxes, which we did at a level that they haven't seen before, cut regulations, and to protect American workers and American steelworkers."
00:28:20 - 00:28:55 (35 sec),"We're going to dredge the channel to Lake Erie. And we're going to replenish the sand to Presque Isle. Do you know what Presque Isle is? Presque Isle. They've been talking about that for a long time. Mike keeps calling, sir, we want to fix up Presque Isle. I said, Mike, what the hell is Presque Isle? [Laughter] He said, sir, it's a beautiful beach."
00:28:55 - 00:29:32 (37 sec),"I had a picture sent to me. There's no sand. That's what he wants. He wants sand. And we're going to get him the sand, OK? We're going to get him the sand. So, he's a great guy. You got to go vote for him. Let me just invite just for a couple of seconds, Mike, please, come on up. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:29:32 - 00:30:09 (37 sec),"Oh, OK, you know what? Listen, listen, President Trump and I have so much in common. First of all, he loves Pennsylvania... and he -- and he made a commitment tonight. He said, what can we do to make it even better in Erie than it is now? What can we do to take the greatest of the Great Lakes and make it better?"
00:30:09 - 00:30:38 (29 sec),"I said, Mr. President, we need to get sand replenishment. He said, how much do you need? I said, I'm not sure. He said, let me know. You're knowing to get that sand. Yeah! And then he said, so what else? What else? I said, you know what, we need to get some dredging done in the channel so that we don't have to light load any more, our ships can come in and out and get out to the world and bring goods in at a much cheaper price."
00:30:38 - 00:31:30 (52 sec),"He said, you know what, we're going to do that, too! And then I said to the president, you know what, Mr. President, you and I have a lot more in common than probably most people understand. And he goes, what would that be? I said, well, sir, we both married up. [Laughter] We both married up! So this beautiful girl standing beside me tonight, mother of four, grandmother of 10, and five of them are over there right now with my son, George, retired Army captain, and they're here because they love this president."
00:31:30 - 00:32:02 (32 sec),"Look, you know that in 2016, candidate Donald Trump came here to this same arena, to a crowd that was almost as big as this. My god, we got thousands of people outside that just want to get in. There's just not enough room for all the love. The president as a candidate said, this will not be my first trip to Erie, Pennsylvania."
00:32:02 - 00:32:34 (32 sec),"This will not be my first time to stand on the shores of the Great Lake Erie. He said, I will be back. But you know what he also did? He made promises to us in 2016. And people said, no, no, no, there's no way he can do that. There's no way we can get there. My gosh, we just spent eight years of somebody telling us in the White House that America's best days have left her."
00:32:34 - 00:33:30 (56 sec),"And you foolish, foolish people. You Americans actually still seem to think that you're exceptional. You are not exceptional! I want to tell you something. Promises made, promises kept. The strongest personality, the strongest president we have seen in our lifetime! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! [Audience Chants USA] Listen, I got to tell you, the last 21 months of my life, I have seen something happen in America that I had never seen before."
00:33:30 - 00:33:57 (27 sec),"I have seen the resurrection of the greatest nation the world has ever known. It knows no boundaries. It doesn't differentiate because of the color of your skin, the shape of your eye, what your gender is, where you worship. Every single American and at every single way every single day is stronger because of this man."
00:33:57 - 00:34:28 (31 sec),"You're the best. You are the best! Now, let me let you in on a little secret. You know, all of us deplorables are here tonight. Yeah, we're all here! But you know there's another group out there that says, you know what, we've got to win these midterms. We've got to knock this president off his perch. We've got to knock America down a notch or two."
00:34:28 - 00:35:12 (44 sec),"Well, I'll tell you, the president said, we're going to win, and we're going to keep on winning, and you're going to get tired of winning. I'll tell you, in Erie, Pennsylvania, we never get tired of winning. That's who we are! I'm going to ask you all -- I'm going to ask you all to do one thing tonight. As you look at this gentleman, who left a life that was so comfortable, who left a life that was so luxurious, to be torn apart every day, to have our first lady attacked every day, to have the first family attacked every day... that is not who we are."
00:35:12 - 00:35:53 (42 sec),"Now, you know how you're going to change that? You're going to take the enthusiasm you have tonight, you're going to take the love that you have in your heart for the greatest country in the greatest nation in the history of mankind, and you're going to get out and vote. You're going to show up in numbers that nobody ever thought would turn out."
00:35:53 - 00:37:09 (75 sec),"Now, listen. There's an old saying. You've got to play it through the whistle. Right? You got to play it through the whistle. You know what this man's saying is? You've got to play it through the echo of the whistle. Listen, I am so grateful and so thankful that an American citizen came out of nowhere to take the reins and reform and recommit this country to the greatest, greatest nation the world's ever known."
00:37:09 - 00:37:15 (7 sec),"I got to tell you, I'm with you, we're all together. Let's go win! Let's go win! Let's go win! [Audience Chants USA]"
00:37:15 - 00:37:35 (19 sec),"What do you think of that, folks? And, truly, look, he's in good shape. You see that. How would you like to be his opponent? [Laughter] But still, you never know. A vote for Mike is a vote to make America great again. It's very simple. I want to introduce another congressmen who has been a friend of mine, also, for a long time."
00:37:35 - 00:37:59 (25 sec),"And he had a very sad day yesterday. He lost his brother. He lost his brother. And he loved his brother like crazy. I said, how close? He said the closest. And a very, very strange, horrible thing happened. And he doesn't want to talk about it. But I will tell you it's a hard thing for him. And he loves this state, he loves the people."
00:37:59 - 00:38:23 (24 sec),"He's been an incredible congressman. He was a politician and various things. He went on to become a great congressman. He is so respected in Washington. And the only bad thing when he said he's going to do this, at my suggestion, I said, Lou, I'm telling you, you can win. And he said, well, if you think it's important."
00:38:23 - 00:38:56 (33 sec),"It was really at my suggestion. In other words, I got him into this. [Laughter] It could have been for the rest of his life. He could have been a congressman. But he's a special man. He's a total winner. And he had a rough time the last few days. And something else happened on top of that. But I'm honored to introduce the next United States senator from the state of Pennsylvania, my good friend, Lou Barletta. [Audience Chants Lou]"
00:38:56 - 00:39:31 (35 sec),"Thank you. Thank you very much. You know, Mr. President, I happen how much you love Pennsylvania. This is like the 9th or 10th time that you've been here. And each time that you come, the list of promises made, promises kept gets longer and longer. And that's OK with us, because now you're overseeing the greatest economy in American history right now."
00:39:31 - 00:40:01 (29 sec),"This economy is soaring. GDP last month was 4.2 percent. Unemployment, 3.7 percent. Four million new jobs were created. And this is the stat I love the most: Four million Americans came off of food stamps. Four million Americans came off of food stamps. Black unemployment at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment at an all-time low."
00:40:01 - 00:40:27 (27 sec),"Women's unemployment at a 64-year low. There are more jobs than people who are unemployed. And I'll tell you how good the economy is: This economy is so good that even Colin Kaepernick found a job. Now, who would want to stop that? Who would want to stop what's happening to the American people right now?"
00:40:27 - 00:40:54 (27 sec),"I'll tell you who wants to stop it: Bob Casey wants to stop it. Senator Bob Casey went to Washington and he forgot about Pennsylvania. He became -- in Washington, he became -- it's no surprise -- he became one of the most liberal senators in Washington. He no longer represents Pennsylvania values. I'll tell you how radical -- I'll tell you how radical he has become."
00:40:54 - 00:41:22 (28 sec),"He is so radical that he said he will vote no, no matter who the president nominates for the next Supreme Court pick. No matter who. Now, he started this craziness. He started this craziness by saying he'd be the first senator to vote no, no matter what. If you don't like the way that Justice Kavanaugh has been treated, then you can't reward Bob Casey by sending him back to Washington ever again."
00:41:22 - 00:41:51 (29 sec),"Listen, it's pretty clear -- it's pretty clear why I'm running for Senate. I'm running for Senate because the president did call and he said, I need you in the Senate. I'm running there because I want to help him because we want to show respect for our law enforcement in America once again. We want to take care of our veterans."
00:41:51 - 00:42:09 (17 sec),"No veterans should ever and will ever die waiting in line for health care in this country ever again. And we're going to support our military, those men and women who travel all over this world to make sure that we have the freedoms that we have and enjoy today and that our children and grandchildren will have that same freedom."
00:42:09 - 00:42:53 (45 sec),"We're going -- we're going to take care of our seniors. We're going to protect the unborn. We're going to put an end to illegal immigration. We're going to -- we're going to build the wall. We're going to build the way. And we are going to kneel when we pray and stand for the flag. No, Mr. President. No, Mr. President, we're not tired of winning in Pennsylvania. We're going to win again in November. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States. Thank you. [Audience Calls Out Lou]"
00:42:53 - 00:43:37 (43 sec),"That's great, Lou. Thank you very much. He's a great man. He's really -- he'll be a fantastic representative for you in Washington, D.C. Got to get out and vote. [Audience Calls Out Lou] So while Lou is fighting for you, Bob Casey is fighting to protect violent criminal aliens. That's what he's doing. Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country."
00:43:37 - 00:44:03 (27 sec),"He'll do it. For example, the sanctuary city of Philadelphia, can you believe this? Could you believe that one? That one I didn't expect to be hearing -- released a criminal alien who was recently convicted of raping and battering a very young child. Bob Casey defends criminals while attacking our brave ICE agents."
00:44:03 - 00:44:46 (43 sec),"He wants to get rid of ICE. Let me tell you about ICE. These are tough, brave people that love our country. These are people that MS-13, they're afraid of ICE. They don't like seeing ICE. And if we don't have ICE, you'll pay a big price. These are great people. These are great people. Lou Barletta and the Republican Party will always stand for the heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and our great, great law enforcement."
00:44:46 - 00:45:19 (33 sec),"These are great people. Bob Casey even voted against Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was gunned down by a five-time deported illegal alien, should have never been in our country. Bob Casey puts criminal aliens before American citizens, always has. By the way, how do you have such a liberal guy in the state of Pennsylvania?"
00:45:19 - 00:46:16 (57 sec),"I'm trying to figure that out. Oh, he's banking on the name of his father. That's no good. Which is why he needs to be voted out of office. He has to be voted out of office. Casey also voted against tax cuts, against Pennsylvania coal. He joined the left-wing mob by voting against Brett Kavanaugh. If you want to save American lives, and save American jobs, and keep things going like they're going now, which is better economically than any time in the history of our country... then you need to vote for a pro-American patriot, and he really is a patriot -- he loves this country -- named Lou Barletta."
00:46:16 - 00:46:43 (27 sec),Get out and vote please. [Audience Calls Out Lou] Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats support a socialist takeover of health care that would totally obliterate Medicare. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and who have paid for it all their lives.
00:46:43 - 00:47:23 (39 sec),"And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We're going to protect people that need help, people with pre-existing conditions. If you want security for your family, for yourself, if you want to continue our great economic boom like we've never seen before, but it's all very fragile, it can end, they want to end it, then you must go out and vote Republican."
00:47:23 - 00:47:59 (37 sec),"We need those votes in D.C. Since the election, as Lou has said, we've created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million people off of food stamps. We've added almost 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. They were supposed to be gone forever. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history."
00:47:59 - 00:48:57 (57 sec),"History. That's in history. Think of that. In history. It's got its best level on unemployment. Think of that. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in poverty. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment has always reached historic lows, lowest in history. And as I always say -- I'm sure you've heard it, I hate to say it again because I know the number is going to be changing very soon, it's going to be even better, women's unemployment has just fallen to 3.6 percent, which is only the lowest rate in 65 years."
00:48:57 - 00:49:22 (25 sec),"I'm sorry. I keep saying it. I keep waiting for that number. I'm sorry, I'd like to apologize to the women, please. Sixty-five years, best in 65 years. I keep waiting for the new number to come out, because that will be history, too, just like African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American. Women, it's only the best number in 65 years."
00:49:22 - 00:49:55 (34 sec),"I'd like to apologize. But it's very true. Women. Women for Trump. Women for Trump. Remember how badly I was going to do with women? I said, am I so bad? Remember how badly? And then I got 52 percent of the vote! And everybody said he beat crooked Hillary. What happened? What -- remember that? Remember they put up these phony numbers?"
00:49:55 - 00:50:26 (31 sec),"But you remember that? We did very well. Thank you to the women. We did very well. She never got it. The truth is she never got it. And she still doesn't get it. She's going around on a tour. Did you know this? Did you know that? I said, you should have saved it for the election. After years of being let down by Washington politicians, you now have a champion fighting for you in the White House."
00:50:26 - 00:50:58 (32 sec),"But I need your help this Election Day, November 6th, to stop the radical Democrat mob from trying to take it away. And they're going to try and take it away. They're going to try and take it away. I need you to show up at the polls to continue this incredible movement, like the country has never seen before, like probably very few countries, frankly, have ever seen before."
00:50:58 - 00:51:37 (38 sec),"The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. Then you should vote Democrat. For many years, our country was being pillaged and plundered by unfair trade deals. Pennsylvania lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs -- you know it well -- I spent lots of time with you folks up here. You know it well -- following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance, pushed by us, into the WTO, World Trade Organization, perhaps the only deal worse than NAFTA."
00:51:37 - 00:52:13 (36 sec),"We got 'em both. They were both beauties, weren't they? But the era of economic surrender is over. America is not being taken advantage of any more. Sorry. America is respected again. America is respected again. Last week, I announced that we are replacing NAFTA with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement called USMCA."
00:52:13 - 00:52:55 (43 sec),"I didn't want to use the word NAFTA. To create jobs that boost incomes, Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We've taken historic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. Did you see -- did you see four weeks ago when Pfizer and Novartis and other drug companies raised the prices of their drugs very, very substantially?"
00:52:55 - 00:53:22 (26 sec),"And I didn't like it. And I called them. I said, you can't do that. You can't do that. And the first time -- and I give them credit. And I really thank them, too, honestly. But first time in history, they rescinded their price increase and they kept it the same, and they promised no increase for a substantial time."
00:53:22 - 00:53:49 (27 sec),"But we're going to get them down. And when I called them up and they agreed to immediately rescind, perhaps that's the first time I realized how powerful it is to be the president of the United States. That was pretty -- that was pretty good. But I give them a lot of credit, and I appreciate it. We're going to get the prescription prices down, though."
00:53:49 - 00:54:12 (23 sec),"We just signed new legislation today, and there's more coming, because you are being ripped off. You know, for the same pill, for the same drug, for the same company that makes it, the same package, you go to other countries, and you'll pay half and you'll pay less than half. It's a rigged system. You remember what else I called rigged?"
00:54:12 - 00:54:44 (32 sec),"I call plenty of things in this country rigged, but we're straightening it out. But it was a rigged system. Plenty of things rigged. And to help critically ill patients access life-saving treatments, we passed something called right to try. People that are terminally ill were given no chance, no hope. We have incredible drugs in the pipeline that can cure really horrible, horrific disease."
00:54:44 - 00:55:16 (32 sec),"We wouldn't let anyone use these drugs because they didn't want to hurt them, but they're going to die. They're terminally ill! I said, what are we doing? And two months ago, I signed right to try. Somebody's terminally ill, we can try. And we've had great success. We've had great success. And by the way, in all fairness, you also find out whether or not it works."
00:55:16 - 00:55:33 (18 sec),"Not so bad. Right to try. You know what it did? These people, if they had money, they'd travel all over the world looking for a cure. If they didn't have money, they'd go home. There was nothing -- they had no hope. No -- they had no hope. Now they have great hope. We make the greatest products in the world."
00:55:33 - 00:56:00 (27 sec),"We make the greatest medicine, and we'd have hope. And some incredible things have already happened with right to try. They've been trying to pass it for 40 years. We got it passed, and that's because of your congressmen. That's because of your congressmen. That are with us tonight. We also passed veterans' choice."
00:56:00 - 00:56:38 (37 sec),"Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. Right? Our veterans. Forty-four years, they tried to pass it. When I first heard about it, I mean, it's not like I was studying it for my whole life. But I heard about it three-and-a-half years ago. I said, I have an idea. Let's -- when they wait on line for 10 days, 22 days, 38 days, you have to see, months and months, why don't we let them go see a private doctor and we paid the bill?"
00:56:38 - 00:57:05 (27 sec),"It will solve our problem. And I told everybody: I am the most brilliant guy in the world. Who else would think -- who else would think of that? So I go back to my people. I say, listen, I have this great idea. We can get these great vets to see the doctors. It's taken -- like 10 days was good. But some of them were ill, but not terribly ill."
00:57:05 - 00:57:25 (20 sec),"It took them so long, they would literally become terminally ill. It took them weeks and weeks to see a doctor. So I went to my people and I said, what an idea this is! They said, actually, sir, we've been trying to get that idea passed for 44 years. I'm good at getting things passed. We signed it three months ago."
00:57:25 - 00:57:58 (33 sec),"For our vets. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our great veterans can be held accountable. In other words, they're immediately fired. Not easy to get passed. They've been trying that one for about 46 years. We got that one passed, too. You think that was easy, getting that by -- I know you have a lot of union guys here."
00:57:58 - 00:58:26 (29 sec),"But do you think that was easy getting that by the unions? Do you think that was easy getting that passed by civil service? Not too easy. We got it passed. Somebody does something bad to our veterans, we fire them on the spot. And we secured $716 billion to fully rebuild the American military. And we gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in almost a decade."
00:58:26 - 00:59:07 (41 sec),"At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force. Very important. It's where it's at. That's where it's going. We want to always be the best. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. And I've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem."
00:59:07 - 00:59:40 (33 sec),"Many, many presidents talked about they were going to do it, and they never had whatever it takes to do it. [Laughter] And I understand why, because there was a lot of pressure on that one. There were a lot of forces saying don't do it. I say, excuse me, get lost. But we did it. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
00:59:40 - 01:00:17 (37 sec),"Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Pennsylvania. We are standing proudly for our national anthem. I need you to get your friends, get your families, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican. Vote for Lou."
01:00:17 - 01:00:59 (42 sec),"Vote for Mike. Vote for all of these great people here. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products made right here in the USA. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is the vote for safety, opportunity, prosperity, and justice."
01:00:59 - 01:01:59 (60 sec),"It is not up to the media or the pundits to decide your fate. It is up to you. It is up to the people of Pennsylvania. It is up to the people of our country. You have the power with your vote to defend your family, your country, your values, your faith, and, indeed, to defend your dignity. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power back to the American people where it belongs."
01:01:59 - 01:02:31 (32 sec),"Pennsylvania is the state that rang the Liberty Bell, forged the railroads, and put steel into the spine of our country. Generations of Pennsylvania workers manned the furnaces, farmed the fields, and fought the battles that made America into the most powerful and prosperous nation in the history of the world."
01:02:31 - 01:03:20 (50 sec),"Unfortunately, years ago, they lost their way, but we have gotten that way back. These courageous Pennsylvania patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our great and proud American heritage. For the sake of freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win."
01:03:20 - 01:04:05 (44 sec),"We will not bend, we will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, and we will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
01:04:05 - 01:04:30 (25 sec),"And always remember, together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:48 (48 sec),"Hello, Johnson City. It is great to be with you. I am thrilled to be back. I look forward to being back in the great state of Tennessee, with thousands of hard-working American patriots. That's what you are. In less than two years, we've achieved the biggest comeback in American history. You look at what's happened."
00:00:48 - 00:01:19 (31 sec),"And our country is respected again. We're respected again. Jobless claims are at a 50-year low. And the stock market is at an all-time high. The economy is booming, wages are rising, and more Americans are working today than ever before. Ever before. And think of that. Think of that. Such a simple statement."
00:01:19 - 00:01:46 (27 sec),"But such a complex thing to do. Think of it. More Americans are working today than ever before. What a beautiful statement. Get out and vote in November. It can all change around quickly, folks. We are defending our Second Amendment, taking care... But Bredesen will not defend your Second Amendment. We're taking care of our great veterans and rebuilding America's military might."
00:01:46 - 00:02:25 (39 sec),"And just today, we made history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job-killing disaster known as NAFTA... with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada -- we added Canada, worked out great -- trade agreement. And we're calling it USMCA. No more NAFTA. No more NAFTA. It's the largest trade deal the United States has ever negotiated."
00:02:25 - 00:03:23 (58 sec),"And it's also a great deal for our country. It's going to produce jobs. And companies aren't going to be leaving and firing everybody and making product and sending it back into the United States, no tax. It's there. It's modern. And it's balanced. And you know what? We have two wonderful partners now. Now they're partners, Mexico and Canada, and that's a good thing."
00:03:23 - 00:03:59 (37 sec),"That's a good thing. America's winning again, and America is being respected again, because we are finally putting America first. But radical Democrats in Congress are trying very hard to erase everything that we've achieved. They're looking out there right now and they're trying to figure out, how do they take an election because they want to take it back?"
00:03:59 - 00:04:07 (8 sec),"You look at your 401(k)s. You know, we're up from the time of the election 55 percent."
00:04:07 - 00:04:28 (21 sec),"I love you, President Trump!"
00:04:28 - 00:04:54 (26 sec),"I love you, too. He doesn't sound like my type. You know, that voice is very strong. But I love him. Whoever you are, I love you. We're just five weeks from one of the most important congressional elections of our lifetime. They're trying to take what we did in '16, something that nobody has seen maybe in other countries, not alone -- it was the greatest election victory in the history of our country."
00:04:54 - 00:05:31 (37 sec),"And between the Democrats, who are obstructionists, who are people that don't want to see strong military, they don't want borders, they don't mind crime... and their enablers, the fake news media, right back there. We've got to be very careful. We've got to be very careful. A Democrat takeover of Congress will plunge our country into gridlock and chaos and take away all of the wealth that you've earned over the last 20 months."
00:05:31 - 00:05:53 (22 sec),"This -- and think of this. The stock market, which is up at record levels, and now the highest, will drop. Your 401(k)s will be devastated. Your taxes will rise beyond your wildest imagination. And crime will flow in to our country through these open borders. Other than that, we'll be doing very well. It's crazy."
00:05:53 - 00:05:53 (0 sec),[Audience chants Built the wall]
00:05:53 - 00:06:36 (43 sec),"And we are. We want to get more money. We want to -- I could build that thing in one year. I could build it. We got $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and another $1.6 billion. We want to build it fast. I can build it -- so after the election, leadership has said, meaning Republicans, they're going to do something that's going to be very strong."
00:06:36 - 00:06:59 (23 sec),"Let's see what happens. But -- but the wall is under construction. A lot of work has been done. A lot of renovation -- if you look at some of it, some wall was up, falling down, terrible condition, now it's beautiful, brand new, and it works. It does work. We need wall. We need border security. We want -- we got to take care of our people."
00:06:59 - 00:07:30 (31 sec),"Look at what's going on. Look at what's going on in California. You have a man running for governor in California that says we don't want any borders. We don't want ICE. We do want sanctuary cities. And they're going to take care of health care, they're going to take care of education, they're going to care of everything for people that just flow in. You're going to have a billion people living in California."
00:07:30 - 00:07:55 (25 sec),"It's going to be a mess. We have it right. We have it going properly. This country will never be Venezuela, that I can tell you, because that's what they're looking for. That's what they're looking for. The Democrat Party has been completely taken over by the so-called resistance. That's all they do. They campaign on resist."
00:07:55 - 00:08:14 (19 sec),"I'll tell you something. They're only good at one thing. They stick together like glue. That's it. They have bad policy. Frankly, they're bad politicians. Everything's bad. But they stick together. We have to be very careful, they'll take everything, including your Second Amendment. They'll take everything away."
00:08:14 - 00:08:49 (35 sec),"Democrats believe that they're entitled to power, and they have been blind in a blind rage ever since, boy, they lost the 2016 -- they've gone loco. They have gone loco. They have gone crazy. This election is a choice between a Republican Party that is building our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down."
00:08:49 - 00:09:16 (27 sec),"The Democrats only know how to obstruct, demolish, and destroy. As we've seen in recent weeks, Democrats are willing to do anything and to hurt anyone to get their way, like they're doing with Judge Kavanaugh. They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he was announced, because they know that Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written."
00:09:16 - 00:09:49 (33 sec),"That's been his history. And he's a good man. Great student, great intellect. Never had a problem. All of a sudden, oh, let's go back to high school. They maybe should go before high school. And I know so many of them. You have the great Vietnam War hero who didn't go to Vietnam -- you know that, right -- Blumenthal."
00:09:49 - 00:10:16 (27 sec),"How about Blumenthal? How about Blumenthal? Da Nang Blumenthal, we call him Da Nang Blumenthal. For 15 years, as the attorney general of Connecticut, he went around telling war stories. People dying left and right, but my platoon marched forward. He was never in Vietnam. It was a lie. And then he's up there -- then he's up there saying we want the truth from Judge Kavanaugh."
00:10:16 - 00:10:56 (40 sec),"And you're getting the truth from Judge Kavanaugh. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Da Nang. You know Da Nang, right? Great city in Vietnam. And then you have Cory Booker, who destroyed Newark. I mean, the job he did in Newark. And see some of the things he wrote when he was young about women. Take a look, OK? And then they want to take a lot longer with the FBI."
00:10:56 - 00:11:19 (23 sec),"No, the FBI -- they should take -- by the way, if we took 10 years, they'd want more time. But they want to take a lot longer. But Dianne Feinstein, she had this... She had this letter for months, and she didn't reveal it until everything was finished. Then she revealed it. Then she says, oh, we want more time."
00:11:19 - 00:11:44 (25 sec),"Let's see how it all works out. But I'll tell you what, they're trying to destroy a very fine person. And we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. Democrats want activist, left-wing judges who will totally rewrite your laws, erase your borders, and replace your values. You don't want that in Tennessee."
00:11:44 - 00:12:05 (21 sec),Republicans know that a judge's job is to follow the law and to deliver equal justice for all. The Democrats can no longer be trusted with your power and with their power. You can't let it happen. They have moved so far left that Pocahontas is considered a conservative. True. That's right. Elizabeth Warren.
00:12:05 - 00:12:46 (41 sec),"She said she's considering a run for the presidency. Please, please run. How about that group, Biden? Biden. We call him 1 percent Biden. Until Obama took him off the trash heap, he couldn't do anything. Now he's talking about running. Tough guy. He's tough guy. He's -- he's a real genius. I want to challenge him to a fight behind the barn."
00:12:46 - 00:13:18 (32 sec),"Oh, would I love that? Wouldn't that be good? I want to challenge Donald Trump. Remember that? He got a little upset. He's another beauty. They got some real beauties going. This November 6th, you have the chance to reject the outrageous policies of the Democrat Party. Not the Democratic Party. But the Democrat Party."
00:13:18 - 00:13:48 (30 sec),"Sounds worse, right? But that's their real name. It's the Democrat Party. But you can only do it. You got to vote for Republican. We need more Republicans to get the votes. Stop the crime. You know, I said the other night, and I said, you know, I think I'm going to keep it. It's a little harsh, but I think I'll keep it. Democrats are the party of crime."
00:13:48 - 00:14:09 (21 sec),"How does that sound? They're the party of crime. Sounds a little tough, but it's true. Open borders. We're thrilled to be joined by many terrific Republican members of Congress, people that are friends of mine, people that have helped me, people that love your state and they love other states and they love our country."
00:14:09 - 00:14:34 (25 sec),"One of them is a man that everybody knows in this state very well. His name is Phil Roe. And he has really helped. Phil? Thank you, Phil. He's always there for you. Thank you, Phil. Another man said -- this is what I was Mr. Trump, not Mr. President -- I was here, he said, you know, we do early voting in Tennessee."
00:14:34 - 00:15:07 (33 sec),"He said, sir, I want to tell you that people are coming out of the mountains, out of the rivers, out of -- they're coming out of the valleys. They're coming -- they said -- right? They're coming out of everywhere. He said, I've never seen anything. I've been doing this stuff for 30 years more. And he said, this is what before -- you know, I'm waiting like we had, like, 30 days, but you have early voting in Tennessee."
00:15:07 - 00:15:32 (25 sec),"So I've never seen anything like it. People that haven't voted, because they haven't liked anybody. These are great people. These are great, incredible people. But they didn't exactly like what they had to go for. So they have a -- now they're coming out with Trump banners, Trump hats, Trump -- you know, make America great again."
00:15:32 - 00:15:57 (25 sec),"And this man -- he said, I can't speak for the rest of our nation, but if the nation's like Tennessee, you're going to win by a lot. And that's exactly what happened, right? John Duncan, Congressman, thank you, John. Where's John? Good. Thank you, John. He made me feel very good before the election. A friend of mine, a great congressman, somebody who's really worked hard."
00:15:57 - 00:16:22 (26 sec),"Even though he's not from your state, does it matter? He's just a great congressman. I see him here. He has been so strong, so smart. He loves this country so much, Congressman Mark Meadows. Thank you, Mark. And Deborah. Deborah, thank you, Deb. Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, who has been fantastic. Where's Chuck?"
00:16:22 - 00:16:48 (26 sec),"Chuck? Thank you, Chuck. Chuck has been great. Morgan Griffith, Scott DesJarlais -- my favorite name in politics. DesJarlais. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. You guys are great. These are really -- these are great people. You know, we don't have to devote a lot of time. I'm just -- these are great people. These are people that love our country."
00:16:48 - 00:17:17 (29 sec),"They want to do the right thing. You know, there's nothing wrong with having strong borders, strong law enforcement. You want to be safe. There's nothing wrong with paying low taxes. There's really nothing wrong. You want to have a strong military, especially in these times. You know, if you have a strong military, you're never going to have to use it. You're never going to have to use it. And we're going to very shortly have the strongest military we've ever had."
00:17:17 - 00:17:35 (18 sec),"We're also joined -- thank you, all -- we're also joined by future Republican members of Congress, Tim Burchett. Where's Tim? Tim? We got to get Tim in there. Tim? Thank you, Tim. John Rose, John, thank you, John. Mark Green, I hear they're up pretty good, but don't take any chances. Don't take any chances."
00:17:35 - 00:17:50 (15 sec),"You've got to go vote. Don't take any chances. We've got to get them in. But they're up pretty good. This is a hell of a state, I'll tell you that. These people... I also want to thank your great governor. I had dinner with him the other night. We were with a group of people. It was a fascinating dinner."
00:17:50 - 00:18:10 (20 sec),"He loves this state, also, and he's done a great job as governor, Governor Bill Haslam. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. Thank you. And Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally, thank you. Thank you, Randy. Great. Great job. Thank you. Great job. And very importantly, we have Tennessee's next governor, Bill Lee. And a man who did a fantastic job during the election for Trump."
00:18:10 - 00:18:30 (20 sec),"I will tell you, State Party Chairman Scott Golden. Thank you, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks. And, finally, the person we are here tonight to support. We cherish this person. She's a fighter. A true fighter for the people of Tennessee. She loves your state. And she's your next U.S. senator, she's going to be fantastic, Marsha Blackburn, Marsha, come up, please."
00:18:30 - 00:18:51 (21 sec),"There we go. Thank you all so much. [Audience Chants Marsha] Thank you. Mr. President, thank you for coming back to Tennessee. We love the president in Tennessee. And I want to say thank you to each of you for being here tonight. Thank you so much for all you are doing to elect all of these Republican candidates that we've talked about tonight."
00:18:51 - 00:20:03 (72 sec),"And thank you for sending Donald J. Trump to the White House. He has had an amazing 20 months. You've just heard some of those things. Not to even mention the foreign policy that he has achieved. Dealing with China, North Korea, getting us out of the Iran deal. And, Mr. President, we in Tennessee really appreciate that you moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem."
00:20:03 - 00:21:00 (57 sec),"Thank you for that. I know -- I know that the Democrats keep saying that there is a blue wave coming, but let me tell you something... Mr. President, when that blue wave gets to the state line, it is going to run smack dab into the great red wall. And that... And that is every single one of you. So if you want a U.S. senator who is going to stand with the president, build the wall, cut your taxes, and to make certain that we take care of our men and women in uniform, I am asking you to stand with me. Let's -- let's take these Tennessee values to Washington, D.C., and put them to work with President Donald Trump."
00:21:00 - 00:21:01 (1 sec),Thank you all. [Audience chants Marsha]
00:21:01 - 00:21:46 (45 sec),"So I just want to thank Marsha Blackburn. And I will you, she's all about Tennessee values. That's the one. She's got Tennessee values. A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for. It's a vote for make America great again. That's what it is. A vote for Bredesen is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... and the real leader of the Democrats, Maxine Waters."
00:21:46 - 00:22:15 (29 sec),"Phil Bredesen wants to raise your taxes. As governor, remember this -- you've got to remember -- seems like a nice guy, but what good does that do? As governor, he raised taxes and fees in your state by more than $1 billion. He opposes the border wall totally. He supported driver certificates for illegal aliens."
00:22:15 - 00:23:30 (75 sec),"And on his watch, Tennessee unemployment doubled. It doubled in the -- whatever it was. How long was he there? Eight? It doubled. You want him to be running -- I don't think so. I don't think so. He doubled unemployment. In 2010, Phil wrote a book advocating government-run health care. That's what you want?"
00:23:30 - 00:24:17 (47 sec),"You want to wait on line for about six weeks to get taken care of? And called for it to be funded by a 20 percent payroll tax on all of the hard-working Americans, many are in this room right now. Government-run health care. No, I don't think so. That hasn't proven too successful anywhere else. Phil was a major financial supporter of President Obama and of Hillary -- crooked Hillary Clinton."
00:24:17 - 00:24:57 (40 sec),"She's crooked as hell. Now Phil is running to be the 51st Senate Democrat and the 51st -- Democrats are elected in November, then Chuck Schumer will become a majority leader. You put in 51. Even though he said something good about our deal with Canada and Mexico today, but how can you not say good? That's why Schumer is so desperate for Phil to win, because everything that we stand for will never get the votes."
00:24:57 - 00:25:29 (32 sec),"We need votes. It's very important. Number one, Marsha will be a great, great senator, but, number two, we need the votes. We've got to have the vote. And he will never once vote for us. Just remember, he will never vote for us. Not on judges. You know, one of the reasons they say I got elected was that Supreme Court judge -- they always say the single most important thing that the president can do is the selection of a Supreme Court judge."
00:25:29 - 00:26:03 (34 sec),"OK. So we picked Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has been fantastic. And now Judge Brett Kavanaugh is actually doing well. I really believe -- we've got to do it. We cannot allow ourselves... to be pushed around. Phil is only running because Chuck Schumer called him up and begged him. The word is begged him to run because Schumer knows the Democrats' path to power runs right through Tennessee."
00:26:03 - 00:26:22 (18 sec),"Again, Second Amendment, higher taxes, lots of crime, MS-13, get used to them. No ICE. We don't want ICE, they say. If you want to stop Schumer from becoming majority leader, if you want to stop your taxes from going up 50 percent or more -- that's what's going to happen -- then you must vote against Bredesen."
00:26:22 - 00:27:07 (45 sec),"Your vote in this election will decide which party controls the Senate. That's how close it is. You know, I'd like to tell you no, but that's how close it is. A Democrat-controlled Senate will always be raising your taxes. They'll always throw open your border. There's nothing you can do. There's nothing he's going to do to change it. He's going to vote with the Democrats."
00:27:07 - 00:27:41 (34 sec),"There's not going to be -- I mean, you look at health care. We got no votes. Look at -- we gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of this country. We didn't get one Democrat vote. And they don't vote for a reason. They just vote because it's bad for Trump. In other words, they want to stop anything that we do. If it's really good, they still want to stop it. And we don't want to let that happen."
00:27:41 - 00:27:53 (12 sec),"We have unbelievable things planned, and we have to let it happen. Flood your streets. They're going to flood your streets with criminal aliens. That's what's going to happen."
00:27:53 - 00:27:55 (2 sec),We love you!
00:27:55 - 00:28:29 (34 sec),"They're always attacking law enforcement. I'll give you an example. Under the Obama administration, we have tremendous amounts of surplus military equipment. Right? Tremendous equipment. You know, heavy armor, lots of different things, that keep the law enforcement professionals, people that we love, that keeps them safe."
00:28:29 - 00:29:11 (42 sec),"They didn't want to give it them. I have given it to them. I'm sorry. They want to block your great judges. They want to weaken the military. They don't -- it's not even weaken. They don't want to spend any money on the military. You know, the beautiful thing about military -- number one, you need it. Everything's like jobs, jobs is very important to me. When it comes to the military, it's not the jobs."
00:29:11 - 00:29:32 (22 sec),"OK? That's totally secondary. But we will soon have the strongest military that we've ever had. We had fighter jets -- we had fighter jets and we had airplanes in our military where the father flew 'em, the grandfather flew 'em, and the son as a young pilot goes in, flying the same planes. You know what?"
00:29:32 - 00:30:01 (29 sec),"They're all going fast. We've ordered all incredible new, finest jets in the world. But the other thing is, they're made right here in the USA. All of them. Jobs, jobs, jobs. They want to outlaw private health insurance. So you'll get great health insurance, and we're already doing it. We're providing you with tremendous amounts of competition."
00:30:01 - 00:30:25 (24 sec),You're getting great health insurance and it's going to get better when we can get a few more votes so we can do it the way you want it. This is the way you want it. They want to shut down American energy and replace freedom with socialism. They want... They want to turn -- it's true -- the Democrats want to turn America into Venezuela.
00:30:25 - 00:30:49 (23 sec),"That'll be wonderful. That'll be wonderful. We're not going to let it happen. And you know what, even most Democrats -- I can't believe -- when you look at what they're doing with sanctuary cities and everything, I can't believe most of them are going for it. Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats in Washington want to raid Medicare to pay for their socialism."
00:30:49 - 00:31:10 (21 sec),"Democrats are pushing so-called medicine for all, robbing our seniors of all of their Medicare benefits. That's what's happening. Republicans want to protect Medicare and our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it. And we always protect Americans with their pre-existing conditions. We're doing that."
00:31:10 - 00:31:42 (32 sec),"On pre-existing conditions, a lot of people think it's not a very Republican thing. It is now, and it has been for me. I want to take care of people with pre-existing conditions. We're doing well. We can do it. Democrats also want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens. Republicans want to protect public benefits."
00:31:42 - 00:32:09 (27 sec),"And we do. We want to protect benefits and public benefits for truly needy Americans, Americans that need help. Democrats want to abolish ICE. In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. And the Democrat Party supports sanctuary cities that unleash violent predators, like MS-13, into our communities."
00:32:09 - 00:32:31 (22 sec),"And remember what I said. It's the party of crime. Democrats -- they really are. You look at what they're doing. Even look at what they're doing in Congress. Even look at what they're doing with our laws, the way they treat our laws, the way they treat country. What they do in Congress. They are indeed the party of crime."
00:32:31 - 00:32:56 (25 sec),"Every day, innocent lives are stolen because of Democrat-supported immigrant policies. If you just take a look, you have immigration policies that are so bad, so dangerous. Just recently in California, an illegal alien with a sex crime conviction and other convictions had a prior deportation. They wanted to deport this person."
00:32:56 - 00:33:28 (32 sec),"They never did. He was convicted for killing a local football coach who leaves behind a wife and six beautiful kids. A pillar of the community. By the way, this is all over. You could go -- you could do this for days. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens."
00:33:28 - 00:33:54 (26 sec),"And Republicans proudly stand with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol, and we stand with law enforcement. This election in November is about safety, and it's also about prosperity. The prosperity of our country. We are doing things now that nobody believes. We are hitting numbers that nobody believes."
00:33:54 - 00:34:30 (36 sec),"Here are just some of our achievements since Election Day. Thank you. We've created over 4 million new jobs. Nobody thought that was possible, 4 million. And lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. We've added nearly 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. That wasn't supposed to happen. Remember when President Obama said you can't do manufacturing?"
00:34:30 - 00:34:53 (23 sec),"Magic wand, right? You'd need a magic wand. You don't need a magic wand. You need proper policies. You need a lot of things. You don't need a magic wand. Remember this. And you've heard me say it a lot. I'm very proud of it. African-American unemployment -- think of it -- African-American unemployment just reached the lowest level ever recorded."
00:34:53 - 00:35:29 (36 sec),"Right? Right? Right? After years of Democrats failing and abandoning African-Americans, Republicans are delivering for African-Americans like never before. We're doing the job. And you saw that the other night with Kanye West. How good was Kanye West? And Big Jim Brown. And so many others. We're supported by so many great folks."
00:35:29 - 00:36:04 (36 sec),"Jim Brown. Boy, we could use him on some of those teams right now, couldn't we? Couldn't we? Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment also reached all-time lows. Women's unemployment recently reached its lowest level in 65 years. That's going to be coming out soon. I think it'll be in history. And last week, I signed a groundbreaking new trade deal with South Korea that dramatically increases American exports."
00:36:04 - 00:36:29 (24 sec),"You remember that deal? Remember that deal? Hillary Clinton -- that was a Hillary deal -- she said we must have this deal with South Korea. It will create 250,000 jobs. And it did for South Korea, not for us. It created jobs for South Korea. We now have a good thing. Friend or foe? Friend or foe? Friend, OK. You never know."
00:36:29 - 00:36:56 (27 sec),"When you hear little noises like that, you say foe, get them out, right? But they're friends. We only have friends in Tennessee, I think. We're also entering new trade talks with the European Union, which, frankly, has treated us extremely badly, and with Japan. Japan sends us millions and millions of cars."
00:36:56 - 00:37:31 (35 sec),"And we're working on a trade deal. We're working on a trade deal. It will be fine. And we are cracking down on China's unfair and abusive trade practices. Got to do it. We've been losing $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 billion a year to China. No more. No more. Right. No more. Can't do it. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation."
00:37:31 - 00:38:04 (33 sec),"And we're doing it with American aluminum and we're doing it with American steel. And our steel is doing really well. Really well. To put more money in the pockets of Tennessee families, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in the history of our country. And we eliminated the core of Obamacare."
00:38:04 - 00:38:26 (22 sec),"We got rid of the individual mandate. It's gone. The worst part of our (inaudible) And as bad as those premiums are, we've kept the premiums down. We've done a lot of things. But we're trying to keep those premiums from the remnant of Obamacare down. But it will all get taken care of. We just need a few more votes."
00:38:26 - 00:38:53 (27 sec),"This year alone, we have successfully lowered your health insurance premiums in the state of Tennessee by 26 percent. That's not bad. Under the past administration, it was like a rocket ship going up. To help critically ill patients access life-saving treatments, we just passed something they've been trying to pass for 45 years."
00:38:53 - 00:39:18 (25 sec),"Right to try. You know what that is. Right to try. Right? I'm very proud -- Meadows helped with that one. And Phil helped with that one, right, Phil? Phil Roe. You guys all helped with that one. And Greg, right, Greg was good. Did a good job. You know, right to try, so somebody's terminally ill, and we have medicines that have great help, great future."
00:39:18 - 00:39:38 (20 sec),"They look good. They're very promising. But we had no right to give those medicines to somebody that's terminal, is going to die. They had no hope. If they had money, they traveled all over the world to find a cure, but yet we have the greatest doctors and the greatest medicine in the world here. But it would be years, three years, four years."
00:39:38 - 00:40:00 (22 sec),"We've reduced it. It used to be 14, 15 years. I think we have it down to three-and-a-half to four. Scott is doing a great job at the FDA. But... Forty-five years they've been trying to pass -- not as easy as it sounds. Not as easy as -- I will tell you, not that easy, but we got it passed. So now somebody's terminally ill."
00:40:00 - 00:40:24 (25 sec),"And if we have a drug that looks like it's possibly going to help, we can actually give it to those people. And you know what? Already we've had success. Some of these drugs are working. Some of these drugs are working. I'm very proud of it, right to try. Hopefully you don't have to use it, OK? I don't want you to have to use it, but you know what?"
00:40:24 - 00:40:41 (16 sec),"If you do, doesn't it make sense, instead of doing -- I mean, if you don't have the money, you just go home and you sit there and it's -- you lose hope, and if you do have money, you go all over the world trying to find a cure. So right to try, remember it. That was a big deal. We also passed veterans choice."
00:40:41 - 00:41:11 (30 sec),"Any veterans in the room? Yes. We do. Young veteran. Young. We just passed choice. That was 44 years they've been trying to pass choice, so that if you have to wait in line for 9 days, 30 days, 21 days, months, you don't do that anymore. If the line's big, and if you're unhappy with it, you go to a private doctor, they take care of you, and we paid the bill."
00:41:11 - 00:41:30 (19 sec),"It's better. And you save a lot of money. It's better. They've been trying to pass that one for many, many decades. They couldn't do it. We got it passed. We're good at passing things, right? We're good. We're good at passing things, right? Oh, look. Come here. Stand up, Phil Roe. Stand up. That's right."
00:41:30 - 00:42:04 (33 sec),"That's right, Phil. Man, no wonder they love you in Tennessee. Great, right? And another one, we just passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act, right? V.A. accountability. This is where you have employees at the V.A., Veterans Administration, who are terrible, who treat our great, great warriors who are troubled."
00:42:04 - 00:42:30 (26 sec),"They're not well. They're sadist. They steal. They rob. They do a lot of bad things, some of them. Some people are incredible. But we now have the right to go after them. We now have the right to fire them. The V.A. Accountability Act is a big thing. And just last week, I signed a record $716 billion funding bill for our military."
00:42:30 - 00:43:18 (48 sec),"And we are giving our troops the biggest pay raise they've had in over a decade. They deserve it. And I just withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal or disaster. And we've recognize the capital of Israel and opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. We've done -- we've done so much, as point after point."
00:43:18 - 00:43:50 (32 sec),"I will not do this to you, but look at this. Page after page after page after page after page. I mean, look at this. Created jobs, 4 million, created manufacturing, 600,000. I mean, you just go point after point -- each one is a major point. I mean, but we're not going to bore you. But nobody's done -- I'll tell you what."
00:43:50 - 00:44:33 (43 sec),"Nobody has done this much in their first two years or probably in any two years -- nobody has done what we as a -- not me, what we have done with the help of all of these people and all of those people. Nobody. True. Nobody has done what we've done. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:44:33 - 00:44:56 (22 sec),"And we've cut more regulations than any administration, whether it's two years, four years, eight years, 12 years, in one case. We have cut more than any president, any administration, in two years, and it's less than two years, we have cut more regulations. And yet we have crystal clean water. We have pure, beautiful air."
00:44:56 - 00:45:26 (31 sec),"We're into that -- also, folks, but you don't have to turn off all business and send business to foreign countries to get it. Under my administration, we are no longer apologizing for America. We are standing up for America. Standing up. And we're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Tennessee."
00:45:26 - 00:46:07 (41 sec),"And we are standing up very proudly for our flag and our national anthem. We are lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. We're building a future of safety and hope and opportunity. And every city and every community in every part of this great land is prospering like they really have never prospered before."
00:46:07 - 00:46:44 (36 sec),"You see what's happening. It's a beautiful thing to watch. That's why outside right now -- I hope they haven't left -- we put big screens out there for them -- but you have close to 20,000 people standing outside. In the great state of Missouri, you had a big, beautiful arena. I always say Madison Square Garden, less maybe 30 percent, OK? Big, beautiful arena."
00:46:44 - 00:47:08 (24 sec),"It was packed. And in Missouri, they had -- you saw it -- 45,000 people outside. Think of it. So something is happening. And by the way... By the way, Claire McCaskill, who is another disaster, is being soundly beaten, we hope. We hope. Missouri. Audience Member"
00:47:08 - 00:47:47 (40 sec),"Thank you. Thank you, 45,000. So we're fighting for the right of all children to have a safe home, a great school, a loving family and a ladder that raises them up to reach their highest dreams. Wouldn't that be nice? We're unleashing the power of faith. We need more faith in this country. The might of justice and the glory of freedom is what we're about."
00:47:47 - 00:48:15 (28 sec),"But to continue this incredible momentum, momentum like -- I don't know if you've ever had this in this country -- you know, I haven't been corrected. I said the 2016 election may have been the greatest election of all time. There's never been anything like this. And we had to fight the Democrats, but more difficult was fighting a very, very dishonest media."
00:48:15 - 00:48:56 (41 sec),"That was much more difficult. Fighting the media is tougher than fighting the Democrats, but they're equal partners. So you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican and vote for Marsha Blackburn and Bill Lee and all of the great Republicans that are running."
00:48:56 - 00:49:15 (19 sec),"Bill Lee, going to be a great governor. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation -- that's a big factor -- and more products made right here in the good, old USA. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:49:15 - 00:50:05 (50 sec),"Remember the old days we had signs on cars and little decals all over the place? It said made in the USA. Guess what? That's what's happening now. Made in the USA. It's coming back. It's a vote to reduce crime, respect law enforcement, and restore the rule of law. Very simple. It's a vote for strong borders, safe communities, and thriving families, and a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democratic politics of anger, destruction, chaos, and to come together as citizens, as patriots, and as Americans, come together as Americans."
00:50:05 - 00:50:29 (24 sec),"To everyone in this room tonight, to every citizen watching all across the land, and they do have a lot of those cameras rolling, unfortunately -- thank you. It's called -- you know what it's called? Earned media, and I earned it. That I will tell you. Earned media. Thank you very much for the earned media."
00:50:29 - 00:50:54 (25 sec),This is your time to choose. This is your time. It's the time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustration of the past. Look at what we've done. Look at what we've done in far less than two years. Look at what we've done. Nobody believes it. They don't believe it. They don't believe it. And they don't want to report it. So we report it ourselves.
00:50:54 - 00:51:47 (53 sec),"They don't want to report it. By the way, 15 percent of them are OK, 85 percent, no good. And it's also a choice of whether we continue forward into the unlimited promise of our future of this great land, this great country. We were losing our country. I've had so many people come up to me, great people, some of them strong and tough -- and, you know, these aren't emotional people -- they have tears in their eyes, say, Mr. President -- I saw one tonight, came up to me, a man, strong, tough cookie, I wouldn't want to fight him, OK? And he said Mr. President -- he's crying -- he said, thank you for saving our country."
00:51:47 - 00:52:06 (19 sec),"So many people say that. So many people. It is not up to the media to decide our fate. It is not up to the pollsters or the pundits -- although our polls are very good right now. They're going nuts with that one. They don't like it when we have good polls. So usually they make up phony polls, but that's OK. They're called repression."
00:52:06 - 00:52:34 (28 sec),"It's repression. Darling, you know the story. I say it a lot. Darling, I really like Donald Trump, but you know, he can't win because CNN did a poll. Hey, did those polls turn out to be wrong or what? But it's called repression. It's called repression. They're phony polls, just like fake news. They're phony, fake polls."
00:52:34 - 00:52:51 (17 sec),"But they said, darling, I really like that guy, but, you know, the polls say, according to some of the news, the media, because most people think it's legit, although that's changed a very lot. They said, darling, let's go to a movie and then we'll come home and watch our friend, Donald. He'll just -- oh, it's so sad what's happening."
00:52:51 - 00:53:08 (17 sec),"I mean, as an example, I heard, darling, that he's going to lose Texas. I heard that he's going to lose Utah. I heard he's going to lose Georgia. So sad. So sad. Well, you know, when Texas came out at 8 o'clock, they said, ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in Texas and the winner is Donald Trump."
00:53:08 - 00:53:47 (39 sec),"Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the great state of Utah and the winner is Donald Trump. Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the great state of Georgia and the winner is Donald Trump. You see, if it's close, they take hours and hours and days. But when you win a landslide, they do it -- that's when I kept hearing he could be in trouble in Texas."
00:53:47 - 00:54:09 (22 sec),"Yeah, I'd like -- I'd like to have trouble like that all the time. We love Texas. And Ted Cruz is starting to do really well in Texas now. And he is a friend of mine. He's doing really well. He's going to win by a lot. He's going to win by a lot. But we had a -- was that the greatest evening? Tell me. Go back two years, almost two years."
00:54:09 - 00:54:37 (28 sec),"Was that the greatest evening, like, ever? Was that, like, the greatest evening? Remember the board? And, boy, that center, that whole thing -- outside a little blue here, a little blue here -- did you see the red -- the whole thing is red? And by the end of the evening, nice guy, John King, his hand was trembling."
00:54:37 - 00:55:03 (26 sec),"He said, oh, oh, Wisconsin, that's been decades. Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. His hand was shaking. What does this mean? What does this mean? Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan, and you hear the people behind him, oh, no, oh, no, don't. Remember that? Remember Pennsylvania? Pennsylvania hadn't been won for many years by a Republican."
00:55:03 - 00:55:21 (18 sec),"It's a great state, great people. I thought we're going to do well there, I thought we were going to -- but all Republicans think they're going to do well in Pennsylvania and then they lose. So I thought we're going to do great in Pennsylvania. Do you remember? There was 1 percent of the vote left. If we lost every single vote, we win by a lot."
00:55:21 - 00:55:45 (24 sec),"They refused to announce it. They refused. They waited until, like, what time, 1 o'clock in the morning? I said, wait a minute, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot. Announce it. They wouldn't announce it. But they had to announce Wisconsin, Michigan. So nothing mattered. But that was one of the great evenings -- you know, that was one of the greatest rating evenings in the history of television, all because of you."
00:55:45 - 00:56:05 (21 sec),"That was a great evening for all of us. And hopefully, we're going to have another great evening in November and you're going to get Marsha in there, because that's so important, Marsha Blackburn. It's up to you to choose our future. It's up to you to choose prosperity and pride over socialism and decay."
00:56:05 - 00:56:51 (45 sec),"It's up to you on November 6th, right, November 6th, November 6th, 2018, loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We're returning power to the American people. That's what we campaigned on. This great state, the state of Tennessee, was forged through the sweat and sacrifice of tough pioneer men and women, tough people, good genes you have, good genes."
00:56:51 - 00:57:23 (32 sec),"This is the state of Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson, who continues to be on the $20 dollar bill. You know that? Andrew Jackson -- they actually -- you know, they were comparing what we did a year-and-a-half ago -- thank you -- I think it was good what he said -- we were comparing -- they were always comparing it to Ronald Reagan."
00:57:23 - 00:57:42 (18 sec),"Then as we went along, they were going -- then they actually started saying, no, the only one that we compare this one is Andrew Jackson. He had one wild election. And then they say, toward the end, and then with the big victory, they said, no, this was actually greater than even Andrew Jackson. And I'm a big Andrew Jackson fan."
00:57:42 - 00:58:09 (27 sec),"And I went to Andrew Jackson's home in Tennessee. And it was great. And it was special. And he was a tough cookie, and he was a great president, too. This state is the home to generations of proud Americans who defy dangers and brave the elements to defend their families, their country, and always to defend their values."
00:58:09 - 00:58:35 (26 sec),"This is what they do. They defend their values. They defend their families. What else do they defend? They defend our great American flag. Don't they defend that? They defend our flag. Just like the pioneers and patriots who came before us, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win."
00:58:35 - 00:59:16 (41 sec),"We're winning. We're winning. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never, ever back down like these people over here. They'll never back down. Like him. Like him. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory, victory, victory. Because, as you know, we are American."
00:59:16 - 01:00:00 (43 sec),"And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Tennessee. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:56 (57 sec),"Whoa, whoa. [Audience Chants USA] I love Ohio. It's great to be back in Ohio. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. This is a truly great state with thousands of hard-working, wonderful, beautiful American patriots. Beautiful. Under Republican leadership, America is being respected again. And all of those thousands of people that aren't under the shell that is standing out there, look at you."
00:00:56 - 00:01:40 (44 sec),"Look at you. They're getting very wet. Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you. There are thousands of people that can't see a thing. In other words, you're better at real estate than they are, but that's OK. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I'm really proud to report that earlier today we secured the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey."
00:01:40 - 00:02:09 (29 sec),"He is now free from jail and he is in the air, heading to Germany, where he'll get off for a brief check, and I think he's going to be in great shape. And then he's coming to Washington, D.C., tomorrow, and we'll say hello to him. Went through a lot, you know? All about Pastor Brunson. He went through a lot, but he's on his way back."
00:02:09 - 00:02:36 (28 sec),"We've done that with a lot, right? We've had a lot of success. North Korea, Egypt, remember? We bring a lot of people back, and that's good. They want to come back to our country, and they're coming back to our country. Tonight, every American heart is with our fellow citizens affected by Hurricane Michael."
00:02:36 - 00:03:00 (24 sec),"Sounds like a very nice name. That was a vicious hurricane. Whether it's in Florida or Georgia or Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, a lot of areas affected, but we just want to give everybody our love. That was a devastating power that hit -- among the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit our country."
00:03:00 - 00:03:33 (33 sec),"It was devastating. But they'll rebuild. They're strong. They're great people. And just God bless you all. Thank you. My administration has been in constant communication with the state and local authorities all over the various states. When we're in trouble, we pull together, we pull together like nobody."
00:03:33 - 00:04:09 (35 sec),"We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary achievements that we've made together in -- can you believe it -- less than two years? It's been Republican leadership and we are here to make sure that our amazing progress continues full speed ahead. Because America is booming. America is thriving. And America is winning, really winning again."
00:04:09 - 00:04:51 (42 sec),And we are viewing now for the first time in many decades a phenomenon called so simply America first. And it's about time. It's about time. Right? About time. It's about time. The unemployment rate has just fallen to the lowest level in more than 50 years. Manufacturing confidence just announced has reached an all-time high.
00:04:51 - 00:05:33 (43 sec),"Think what that matters. Think what that is, confidence, confidence. The people of Ohio have confidence. Can tell you that. No, but think of it. If you remember the previous administration said manufacturing jobs... Other than that, you like them very much, right? But remember, they said manufacturing jobs, they're gone, they're dead."
00:05:33 - 00:06:02 (29 sec),"Remember the expression, you'd need a magic wand to bring them -- bring them back? We're bringing them back. I guess we have the magic wand. They're coming back. And they're coming back from Mexico, they're coming back from Canada, they're coming back from everywhere, because they all want to be where the action is. They all want to be in the USA."
00:06:02 - 00:06:59 (57 sec),"That's where we want to be. That's where the jobs are. We are now the hottest country anywhere in the world. All across... [Audience Chants USA] By the way, I wish the cameras would get this crowd. This crowd is incredible. Look at the cameras back there. It's like the Academy Awards. Look at this. How would you like to have to do this every night?"
00:06:59 - 00:07:43 (43 sec),"No, no, how would you like to have to do this every night? And one little mistake, one little mistake and they try to destroy your entire career. Boy. No, I mean, look at this. Seriously, look at -- look at the magnitude of it. Look at the number of the media back there. Look at that. Fake news. Fake news."
00:07:43 - 00:08:13 (30 sec),"Fake. You go back and they'll say, did he say -- did he say this? Or that? Or this? That's OK. You know what, we've learned how to live with them. We've learned how to live with them. We don't like it, but we've learned. All across Ohio, steel mills are reopening, and we are putting our coal miners back to work."
00:08:13 - 00:08:40 (27 sec),"One of the things we're most proud of - look, steel was dead. Steel was dead. I came into office, steel was a dead business. Now they're opening up plans, U.S. Steel, Nucor. They're opening up plants all over the country, big ones, new ones. We're taxing the hell out of the dumpers. You know, you had the dumpers that were hurting your steel industry?"
00:08:40 - 00:09:07 (27 sec),"And you know what happens? After the industry dies -- would have died within two years. After it dies, they would come in and they would charge you three times more money. Nobody says it, but that's what happens. So we're going to have beautiful new American-made steel... It's not going to be mud or it's not going to be sand steel."
00:09:07 - 00:09:35 (27 sec),"You know they put garbage in this stuff they were dumping. We don't even know what's in it. It's going to be U.S. steel. It's going to be American steel. We're going to get the iron ore from our mines, right, beautiful. They're opening up again. Our mines are opening up again. Metallurgic coal, but our miners are back to work."
00:09:35 - 00:10:16 (42 sec),"We don't need outsiders telling us about our steel industry. It's incredible. Seriously, it's incredible what's happened. It's hot as a pistol. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation, which is what we want. And this has been... [Audience Chants USA] So this has been a really historic week for America."
00:10:16 - 00:10:53 (37 sec),"Really historic. And by the way, our magnificent first lady, Melania... just returned from an incredibly successful trip to Africa. It was an incredible trip. And she came back, and she told me so beautiful, so beautiful, and yet such incredible in some cases poverty. They need help. They definitely need help."
00:10:53 - 00:11:21 (28 sec),"It's both beautiful and sad. It's got every kind of emotion. But you probably saw her travels. They were really incredible. And it opens your eyes to what's going on around the world. You're all very lucky in Ohio. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. Thank you. And on Monday night in the East Room of the White House, we achieved a tremendous victory for our nation, our freedom, and our Constitution."
00:11:21 - 00:12:09 (48 sec),"America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Did he get treated badly and unfairly or what? Horrible. And I'll tell you what. He's done us a tremendous service, what -- the way they treated him, I've never seen anybody treated like that."
00:12:09 - 00:12:38 (29 sec),"But he's done us a great service, because we are more energized as Republicans that ever -- I think ever before. I think ever before. We just got poll numbers for some of the Senate races. And you look at some of these Senate races where we weren't even going to contest. It's a Democrat that's in. We were figuring in -- you know, we're winning with candidates that are -- we're winning."
00:12:38 - 00:13:22 (44 sec),"We're beating people that we weren't going to contest. So it's been amazing. Because people realize how important the Supreme Court is. And we could have two, three, maybe even four more choices, and we have to be able to get the votes to put them through. Go out and vote November 6th. From the moment Brett Kavanaugh was announced, an angry Democrat mob was on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy him."
00:13:22 - 00:13:51 (29 sec),"And before they even know -- I'll tell you, you saw it. Before they knew his name, they were saying horrible things. They didn't even know who was going to be the pick. He wasn't picked. I didn't know who was going to be the pick. And they were saying horrible, horrible things. These are bad people. We can't let this happen to our country."
00:13:51 - 00:14:24 (33 sec),"Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob. That's what it is. It's a mob. The people of Ohio can save America from radical Democrats. They've become radicalized. I mean, Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, seriously... No, no, seriously, she's becoming mainstream. You believe that one? We have to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate."
00:14:24 - 00:14:58 (34 sec),"We need the votes. We need the votes. And, by the way, for the people of Ohio, early voting starts right now. You got to get out. Vote early. And then anybody that votes early, you can leave. The hell with you. That's -- you know, I worked in Cincinnati, Ohio, two summers. I loved Ohio. I loved Ohio. I shouldn't tell you this, but I used to travel a lot to Kentucky."
00:14:58 - 00:15:36 (38 sec),"Does anybody travel to Kentucky? Right? No, I -- I like Kentucky. But I traveled to Kentucky when I spent a lot of time in the Queen City. I love the Queen City. We had a job, Swifton Village, Swifton. Does anyone ever hear of Swifton? And it was a great experience. It was a successful experience. I did it with my father, one of my earliest things that I've done, and I guess it's sort of like if you get your first up as a hit, you're a hitter, you hit, you sink the 10-foot putt on the first hole."
00:15:36 - 00:16:10 (34 sec),"But we had a great success in Ohio, and I've never forgotten it. And then they said -- remember, for months before the election, you cannot win without getting the great state of Ohio. Right? And I got the great state of Ohio. And I love the great state of Ohio. We got it. We got it. Remember? They used to say that every time."
00:16:10 - 00:16:36 (26 sec),"I used to hear it. I have fantastic people in Ohio that did a job for me. Bob Paduchik, where's Bob? I had just a great group of people. They did incredible work. But they constantly would say on these phony networks, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio. And then they started doing polls, and I was way up. And I think we won it by 9 or 10 points."
00:16:36 - 00:17:12 (36 sec),"A lot. We won it by a lot. In fact, you know the way, if it's close, they have to take hours and hours and hours, right? So with Ohio, I'll never forget, they said the polls have closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. Crazy. We won Ohio by so much that it took one second before they called it, OK? We won by a lot."
00:17:12 - 00:17:46 (34 sec),"It's a great place. And by the way, have I produced? Look at what's coming into Ohio now. Have we produced? I produced and you produced. If Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats... take control, they will try to raise your taxes, impose socialism on this country, take away your health care, and take away your jobs."
00:17:46 - 00:18:13 (27 sec),"We have more people working now than ever before. They want to take away -- that's what will happen. The Democrats want to erase America's borders and let drugs, gangs and crime pour into our country. In fact, I've been going around lately saying the Democrats are the party of crime. And nobody even challenges me, not even the fake news media."
00:18:13 - 00:18:48 (35 sec),"They don't even challenge me. Republicans are the party of safety and Republicans are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. And that's what's happened. And we're honored to be joined tonight by many terrific Ohio Republicans, including Republican Party Chair -- I have to say, this woman is incredible, because, you know, I got dropped just before the election by the head of the Republican Party."
00:18:48 - 00:19:31 (42 sec),"I've never been dropped in my life. And a woman came in who is a very successful person with a great family. And she took that thing over. What a job she's done. Her name is Jane Timken, and she is very special. Where's Jane? She's incredible. Thank you very much. And a man who said, oh, you're going to win, you're going to win, and I said, well, how do you know?"
00:19:31 - 00:19:56 (26 sec),"So I had five people to choose from to head up my campaign in Ohio. And one name, I don't know, I liked the name, I liked the sound of it, his name was Bob Paduchik. Why do I like that name? Why? It's not outstanding. But he came in and he did a job, and I had the support of the people, but not the support of a lot of others."
00:19:56 - 00:20:16 (20 sec),"And he just said, you're going to win. And every time I called him up and say, you know, this happened, that happened, he said, that's OK, you're going to win by more. This guy's the most positive guy. So I want to thank Bob Paduchik. So good that we moved him over to the RNC, but, Bob, in about a year from now, get ready."
00:20:16 - 00:20:50 (34 sec),"You're coming back here. Thank you, Bob. And we have a friend of mine who's an incredibly respected man in the United States Senate. When he speaks, we all listen, including the president. He really is. He's a great, great guy. He's loved in Ohio. Senator Rob Portman. Where is he? Thank you. He's a respected guy."
00:20:50 - 00:21:15 (25 sec),"Thank you, Rob. Congressman Warren Davidson and Congressman Brad Wenstrup, thank you. Thank you, fellas. Great job. So many things we passed in Congress. Those two guys were there with us. Thank you very much. What a job they've done. We're also joined by your next lieutenant governor Jon Husted. Jon, thank you."
00:21:15 - 00:22:01 (46 sec),"Thank you, Jon. And I hear you're up a little bit, Jon. We've got to get that over, because you're going against a very bad guy. I'll tell you, he's a bad guy. And everybody -- I'll tell you, Jon is with a friend of mine, and they decided to get together, which is very smart. Instead of going like this to each other, they got together, and Jon is running with your next governor, Mike DeWine... And Mike and Jon are running against Elizabeth Warren's far-left disciple, Richard Cordray."
00:22:01 - 00:22:33 (32 sec),"Jon, am I allowed to say some bad things about Cordray? Because let me tell you, he did such a bad job at the agency that he ran. It was terrible. He was hurting people. And I think he enjoyed it. No, really. I really believe he enjoyed it. He was putting people out of business. They weren't loaning money to the people that they were supposed to. It was terrible."
00:22:33 - 00:23:09 (36 sec),"Cordray spent $250 million federal dollars trying to renovate a headquarters, his agency, that they didn't even own, more than twice what the entire building was worth. They didn't own it. And then it became a big scandal. But because it was a Democrat, the fake news didn't want to write about it. Then after spending like $50 million on some elevators, it turned out that they didn't work."
00:23:09 - 00:23:30 (22 sec),"If Cordray were ever -- and I'll tell you what, this is a Pocahontas dream to get this guy elected. [Audience Laughs] I can't believe -- you know, I know Ohio pretty well, right? I've done a lot for the steel industry. More than anybody's done in many, many -- I mean, you speak to U.S. Steel, they'll tell you."
00:23:30 - 00:23:57 (27 sec),"A lot for the miners, a lot for everybody. This guy does not belong in the state, folks. OK? First of all, he's a super liberal. Why do you do that? Why do you do that -- is he -- OK, go with DeWine, please. And Jon. Cordray would be an absolute disaster for Ohio. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing."
00:23:57 - 00:24:36 (39 sec),"I couldn't wait to get him out. We tried so hard. You know, you had one of these deals that you couldn't get him out. But we tried so hard. And they've done such a great job since we got him out. He was bad. You don't need him in Ohio. Now, I'm thrilled to introduce the next United States senator from Ohio, Jim Renacci, who's a great guy and a great friend of mine."
00:24:36 - 00:24:47 (11 sec),"Jim, come up. Come up. Come. This is a good man. Nothing's easy about politics, but I'll tell you what, he's in there fighting, and just get out and vote for him. He is a good, good friend of mine and a good man."
00:24:47 - 00:25:27 (40 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. It's an honor to stand here with you tonight, like I stood with you 31 months ago when you were candidate Trump, and I told you I am with you. I told you I voted for you. I told you my wife voted for you, my family voted for you, my friends voted for you. Because we needed you to change Washington, and you haven't let me down."
00:25:27 - 00:26:13 (47 sec),"Look, this crowd loves you. Ohio loves you. And we love what you're doing! You've got the Ohio economy growing. Unemployment is down. Wages are up. The tax cut and jobs bill is working in Ohio. You have two Supreme Court judges confirmed and more circuit judges confirmed than any other president. You've repealed the individual mandate that was hurting so many individuals here in Ohio, renegotiated NAFTA, helping Ohio business, passed right to try."
00:26:13 - 00:27:06 (53 sec),"ISIS is on the run. And you have given our coal miners here in Ohio hope by reversing those devastating policies of the prior administration that had vowed to bankrupt that industry. Promises kept -- promises made, promises kept. Look, Mr. President, we are not tired of winning here in Ohio. And yet you've been able to do all that with no help from Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown."
00:27:06 - 00:27:39 (33 sec),"He has fought you every turn, voting against the tax bill, voting against coal miners, voting against your judges' confirmations. You asked for help, and that's why I jumped in this race seven months ago. And I am here to help, just like Ohio, everyone here is here to help. Sherrod Brown votes 96 percent of the time with Chuck Schumer and 94 percent of the time with Elizabeth Warren."
00:27:39 - 00:28:35 (56 sec),"Yet he voted 100 percent of the time with President Obama's judge appointments. He supported Hillary Clinton for president. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up] And -- and even though -- and even though you are ripping up those trade agreements that aren't working for Ohio, Senator Brown had the gall just a month ago to say the only thing President Trump has done for trade policy is run his mouth and line his pockets."
00:28:35 - 00:29:09 (34 sec),"That's the type of guy who is not helping this president. Sherrod Brown is the fourth most liberal senator in the country. That's not Ohio. That's not even close to the average American. He votes like a Hollywood liberal, and he has received the most lobbyist money in the Senate, more than any other senator, he has received the most lobbyist dollars."
00:29:09 - 00:29:54 (45 sec),"Look, it's time we send Sherrod Brown packing. And it's time we send me to Washington. Someone that's willing to help this president... [Audience Chants Drain the Swamp] In 25 days... In 25 days, in just 25 days, we need to retire Sherrod Brown. We need a red wave. We need a red -- not only a red wave -- and I said this earlier."
00:29:54 - 00:30:08 (14 sec),"Mr. President, Ohio is going to deliver a red tsunami. Thank you for what you're doing, Mr. President. And thank you for what you've done for Ohio. Thank you."
00:30:08 - 00:30:41 (32 sec),"Thank you. Thanks, Jim. It is true. Sherrod Brown's never voting for us. He didn't vote for anything that we want. Yet I hear he goes around -- he does the best commercials. In fact, I just want to think, is he a Republican? He's doing these commercials that he likes Donald Trump. He'll never vote for us. He didn't vote for Justice Kavanaugh."
00:30:41 - 00:31:36 (55 sec),"He didn't vote for tax cuts. He doesn't vote for us, folks. I mean, it might be nice for him to say he agrees with my economic policy when he's never going to vote for it. So you're just kidding yourself. He voted yes on amnesty for illegal aliens. He voted yes on deadly sanctuary cities. We started building the wall, and we've made progress, but he voted against it. [Audience Chants Build the Wall] So illegal immigration takes American lives, American jobs, and American taxpayer dollars."
00:31:36 - 00:32:02 (26 sec),"A border wall, which is moving faster than anybody would believe... is truly a life-saving barrier against deadly floods of drugs, crime, smugglers, traffickers, cartels. Our brave border agents want a wall. They need a wall. It's happening. It's moving. We have made so much progress. We will finish the wall."
00:32:02 - 00:32:39 (37 sec),"If you want more jobs and less crime, if you want to stop Schumer from running the Senate... we need the vote of Jim Renacci. We do. Jim is a good person. He's a great guy. We need his vote! You know they say we have a majority. But if somebody has a cold, they can't come in, we don't have a majority anymore."
00:32:39 - 00:33:00 (21 sec),"We got to get people. We've got to get some Republicans so we can vote. Finally, it's my privilege to introduce a tremendous Ohio Republican. We're here for him tonight. A great friend of mine, he's fought so hard for everything we've done. He's a true fighter for the state, Congressman Steve Chabot. Great guy."
00:33:00 - 00:33:00 (1 sec),"Come up, Steve. Come up, Steve."
00:33:00 - 00:33:58 (57 sec),"Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President. And God bless Warren County! All right, yeah, all right. And God bless Hamilton County, too. I have Hamilton County. And Butler County, as well, and the Kentuckians. Oh, God bless you all. And God bless President Trump! Thank you. And I never knew I'd say this."
00:33:58 - 00:34:26 (28 sec),"But God bless Kanye West! Hey, you know -- you know how many liberals it takes to screw in a light bulb? None, because they'd prefer to stay in the dark, so... [Audience Laughs] Let me just -- let me just say, I got like a -- I got about a six-page speech here. I decided the more Steve Chabot you get, the less President Trump you're going to get, so I'm not going to give this speech."
00:34:26 - 00:34:43 (17 sec),"God bless you all, and God bless the President Trump!"
00:34:43 - 00:35:19 (37 sec),"Thank you, Steve. So just remember, a vote for Steve Chabot is a vote to protect your family, your jobs, and your country. Now, Steve's winning. Nice poll numbers. But don't take any chances. Get out and vote, please, OK? No chances. We don't want to hear about any upsets. He's a great, great guy. If you want to stop the radical Democrats, if you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker -- can you believe it -- and you have to get out and vote for Steve."
00:35:19 - 00:35:56 (37 sec),"Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats have signed up for a socialist takeover of American health care that would utterly destroy Medicare and Rob our seniors of the benefits they paid into their entire lives. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and they've paid for it. And the Democrats want radical socialism, and they want open borders where everybody pours into our country."
00:35:56 - 00:36:25 (29 sec),"It's what they want. I don't get it, but that's what they want. Does anybody want that? Open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. Think of that. I'll tell you what, the incredible men and women of ICE are not treated properly. They're not treated properly. They do an incredible job."
00:36:25 - 00:36:59 (34 sec),"The Democrats want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens, MS-13 killers, and anybody else that wants to come in. We're not going to have it. We're not going to have it. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. This election is about safety and is about prosperity."
00:36:59 - 00:37:24 (25 sec),"Since the election, which is incredible. If I would have said this, I've been to Ohio so many times, been to every part of Ohio. The people are great. But if I would have said this, the fake news would have said, how dare he say that. Since the election, we've created over 4.2 million new jobs... and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps."
00:37:24 - 00:37:58 (33 sec),"Big deal. That's a big deal. We've added nearly 600,000 brand-new beautiful manufacturing jobs. Right? African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in the history of our country. And African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever, lowest rate ever. My -- that's a big number, right?"
00:37:58 - 00:38:24 (26 sec),"How do they beat that number? How does anybody beat that number? We're going to have these people come in. For over 100 years, they've claimed and they've wanted and they've said -- they've lied to African-Americans. Remember my statement, what do you have to lose? Guess what? They all believe it now. What do you have to lose?"
00:38:24 - 00:38:52 (28 sec),"They're doing -- we are doing great as a country. But I'm so proud -- I am so proud of the kind of numbers you're hearing. My administration is fighting every day to deliver safety, opportunity, and justice for everybody, for everybody. We're asking as an example all African-American voters to honor us with their support this November."
00:38:52 - 00:39:27 (35 sec),"Get away from the Democrats. Get away from the Democrats. They've done nothing. They've done nothing. Think of it. We have the best numbers in history on employment and unemployment and median income and many other things. And I think we're going to get the African-American vote. And it's true. Kanye West, what he did was pretty amazing yesterday."
00:39:27 - 00:40:04 (37 sec),"Pretty amazing. And you know who else was with him? A guy you know well, big Jim Brown. Big Jim. What do you think Big Jim would be making today in the NFL? He was unstoppable, right? Unstoppable Jim Brown. He was a great football player and is an even greater man. He's great. Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans likewise have the lowest unemployment in the history of our country."
00:40:04 - 00:40:50 (46 sec),"And women unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is soon to be changed to historic levels, but right now, I'm sorry, it's the lowest in 65 years, OK? Sorry! Sorry, women! I let the women down. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning, right? Tired of winning. Last week, I announced that we are replacing the horrendous NAFTA -- NAFTA was a disaster, folks -- NAFTA was a disaster -- with the incredible, brand-new, U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, the USMCA."
00:40:50 - 00:41:27 (37 sec),"It's opening up Canada, opening up Mexico for our farmers, our -- everybody. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's unfair trade actions and trade abuses. And thanks to our tariff, and especially on steel that's been dumped all over this country, the Ohio steel industry and the U.S. steel industry is roaring back to life and soon will be hitting its most successful years ever."
00:41:27 - 00:41:59 (32 sec),"Very serious. And you see it. You see it all over this state. Under Republican leadership, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. And by the way, Sherrod Brown voted against them. We reduced high-dose opioid prescriptions by 16 percent during my first year and now they're dropping much lower than that."
00:41:59 - 00:42:57 (57 sec),"And I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress -- thanks to Rob Portman and a lot of others -- thank you, Rob -- but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support. We also passed veterans' choice, the V.A. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor and the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans, who we couldn't fire, we couldn't do anything about it, we now look at them and say, Jim, you're fired."
00:42:57 - 00:43:42 (45 sec),"Out. Get out. True. True. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion for the second year to fully rebuild the American military, which had to happen. We needed it. And much less importantly, when it comes to the military, every bit of equipment is being built in the USA. That's the only place where jobs are secondary."
00:43:42 - 00:44:15 (33 sec),"Number one, we needed the equipment. But it's all being built here. We make the greatest military equipment in the world. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force. Very important. Very important. That's very important. Hate to say it, but very soon, that's where it's going to be at. It's going to be space, everything, defense, offense, everything."
00:44:15 - 00:44:41 (26 sec),"And we have tremendous support from Rob and the Senate. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal, and look what happened to Iran. You know, when I took office, Iran was all over the place. They were taking over Syria. They were taking over Yemen. They were taking over everything."
00:44:41 - 00:45:07 (26 sec),"I actually said, this is going to be a problem, and we've got to do something. And about four months ago, we withdrew from that horrible, ridiculous deal. And you take a look what's happening to Iran. There's riots all over the streets, all over the cities. It's a whole different ballgame. It's a whole different country."
00:45:07 - 00:45:52 (45 sec),"And it's looking real good. Looking real good. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and reopened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together, we've made unbelievable progress, and we're just getting started. We have so many other things. If you vote to elect Republican House, Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes very, very substantially."
00:45:52 - 00:46:43 (51 sec),"We will protect Medicare and we will protect your Social Security. The Democrats cannot do it. We will continue to confirm judges who interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass case law, crack down on sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery and chain migration, defend the ballot box for American citizens, and throw vicious MS-13 gangs the hell out of our country, like we're doing right now."
00:46:43 - 00:47:04 (21 sec),"You know, I say it to people, MS-13 gang, vicious, horrible people. We're throwing them out of here by the thousands. But you know who's doing it? Do we love law enforcement or what? But you know who's... But ICE, in Long Island, where I sort of grew up -- I was right next to these areas. I know them so well."
00:47:04 - 00:47:27 (22 sec),"You had towns that were practically taken over by MS-13. And ICE goes in like it's a day in the office. And they're tougher and smarter that these wise guys. And they start throwing them in the paddy wagon, throwing them in, get the hell out of here. And you know what? The towns are liberated. The people are clapping from windows."
00:47:27 - 00:47:55 (28 sec),"The people are clapping all over the streets. These towns, like a country that was invaded and taken over and then was liberated. These towns are being liberated of the MS-13 garbage that came into our country. Under the previous administration, by the way. And they came in by the tens of thousands -- well, we have set every record on getting them out."
00:47:55 - 00:48:20 (25 sec),"And I want to tell you, there's nothing that gives me more pleasure. And for all of the companies that are moving back in to the United States, we will finally have a merit-based system of immigration. Not just lump -- not a lottery, pick them out of a hat. Who the hell are they? Who is he? Pick them out of a hat."
00:48:20 - 00:48:40 (20 sec),"We're letting people come in on merit, where they can help you, where they can help these companies grow. Right now, we have a system, lottery, a lottery. Think of it, lottery. Oh, pick 'em, I wonder? What people do you think these countries are putting in? Do you think they're putting in their finest? I don't think so. I don't think so. So we're going to end it. We're going to have a merit-based system."
00:48:40 - 00:49:02 (22 sec),"Bring them in through merit. We're lifting millions of people from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. And you see that happening. But to achieve this, you have to get out November 6th or vote early and vote Republican. We need the votes. We have to have those votes. For years and years, you've watched as your leaders apologized for America."
00:49:02 - 00:49:23 (21 sec),"They apologized for America. Now you finally have a president who is standing up for America. [Audience Chants USA] I have to tell you, I wish these fakers back there, the fake news, I wish they'd turn the cameras and show behind them, show outside these walls. Look at the people out there. It's amazing."
00:49:23 - 00:50:48 (84 sec),"Look, they never turn the cameras. I go home, I say to my wife, how did the crowd look? They only show your face. They never move the camera. But you know what? She can tell by the sound, because... True. She can tell by the sound, because, you know, if you have, like, let's say, one of the normal presidents walk in. We've had a lot of normals."
00:50:48 - 00:51:22 (35 sec),"And some great ones. You'd have, what, 300 people show up. But you can tell by the sound, because 300 people cannot make the sound of thousands and thousands and tens of thousands like that. They can't do it. So even though they refuse -- you know, normally I'd like it, but I don't. They don't want to move the camera."
00:51:22 - 00:51:43 (21 sec),"The only ones that become famous are about six people right behind me. [Audience Laughs] They don't have the best seat in the house, but they're going to become the famous ones. No, but, honestly, you know, I know what stadiums sound like, and this sounds like on television we're in the middle of an Ohio State football game."
00:51:43 - 00:52:42 (59 sec),"It's what it sounds like. It's what it sounds like. And speaking of Ohio State -- they're not doing too badly, are they, huh? Great coach. You have a great coach, great guy. Great guy. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Ohio. And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. But to continue our momentum, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and vote Republican, vote early or on November 6th, vote Republican."
00:52:42 - 00:53:18 (35 sec),"Vote for Steve Chabot, Jim Renacci. Vote for DeWine. We need DeWine. We got to have DeWine. Where the hell is Jon? Are you over there, Jon? He's still here. He'll never leave. You got to vote. We need a governor here -- you cannot let this happen to Ohio. This Democrat is a disaster. A proven disaster. Vote DeWine."
00:53:18 - 00:53:48 (30 sec),"He's a good man, and a good man, too. You've got two good men. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, more products made right now in the USA, which is what we're all about. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement."
00:53:48 - 00:54:17 (29 sec),"Thank you, law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division. You've seen that. You just saw it with a high-quality, highest quality, this incredible man. You saw it. Brett Kavanaugh, you saw it, what they did to him and his family. And his young, beautiful daughters."
00:54:17 - 00:55:00 (43 sec),"Right? Da Nang Dick, Da Nang Dick, how about Da Nang? Da Nang Dick. Cory Booker, he ran Newark into the ground. Senator Dianne Feinstein, how about that? How about that? Seriously. [Audience Chants Lock her up] Who think that Dianne Feinstein leaked the papers? Who thinks... She was very unprepared for that question."
00:55:00 - 00:55:35 (36 sec),"No, I didn't -- she was very unprepared, right? Very unprepared. Dianne Feinstein. You know, what they did to this man, he will go down along with Justice Gorsuch -- and, by the way, how good is Clarence Thomas? How good? How good? He's going to go down as one of your greats. It's up to the people in this incredible -- I don't know if you call it a room."
00:55:35 - 00:56:05 (30 sec),"I don't know what the hell it is. All I know -- is this a room or a roof? I think it's a roof. Whatever it is, there are a lot of people. But it's up to you, folks. You have the power with your vote to defend your family, your country, your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity. So we had the greatest movement in the history of our country."
00:56:05 - 00:56:35 (30 sec),"We really did. We really did. You know, they can say what they want, but nobody even challenges it. You know, I'll say that a lot. And usually, if there's, like, a 2 percent variation, the fake news will hit me the next day. Trump exaggerated or something. Actually, we've under-exaggerated, because we've produced more than I ever promised during the campaign."
00:56:35 - 00:56:57 (21 sec),"More. But we had the greatest -- but look at the -- look at this. Look at this group. We had the greatest -- and we never -- by the way, I hate to disappoint you, but we went to Mississippi, we went to Missouri, we went to Nevada, we went to -- every place, and we have crowds, we have tens of thousands of people outside of every arena."
00:56:57 - 00:57:19 (22 sec),"They have to start building larger arenas in this country, right? Something is happening. And I saw this in the election. We'd go -- I'll never forget -- we went to Michigan, final stop. I got there 1 o'clock in the morning. There was actually Election Day, 1 o'clock in the morning. There were 32,000 people."
00:57:19 - 00:57:45 (26 sec),"I see some people there, they were there. It was unbelievable, 32,000 people. I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning. I got home at 4 o'clock in the morning. And I said, you know, we had 32,000. Crooked Hillary had, like, 500. And I said, why aren't we going to win the great state of Michigan? And guess what?"
00:57:45 - 00:58:18 (33 sec),"We did. We did. And it hadn't been won in decades by a Republican. And now they like me even more. You know why? Because car companies are moving plants back in. And just so you don't feel too lonely, they're moving the plants back into Ohio also. A lot of them. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country."
00:58:18 - 00:58:57 (39 sec),"And together we are taking back our country. We're returning the power back to the incredible American people. Ohio is the state that gave us a great president who hasn't been properly recognized, OK? William McKinley has not been properly recognized. What he did in terms of trade, in terms of war, but in terms of trade -- and I hate to say, in terms of being smart in tariffs, William McKinley has not been properly recognized."
00:58:57 - 00:59:27 (30 sec),"But maybe someday he will. It also gave you a general, who was incredible. He drank a little bit too much. You know who I'm talking about, right? So Robert E. Lee was a great general. And Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia. He couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. He was going crazy. I don't know if you know this story."
00:59:27 - 00:59:48 (21 sec),"But Robert E. Lee was winning battle after battle after battle. And Abraham Lincoln came home, he said, I can't beat Robert E. Lee. And he had all of these generals. They look great. They were the top of their class at West Point. They were the greatest people. There was only one problem. They didn't how the hell to win."
00:59:48 - 01:00:14 (27 sec),"They didn't know how to fight. They didn't know how. And one day, it was looking really bad. And Lincoln just said, you -- hardly knew his name -- and they said, don't take him. He's got a drinking problem. And Lincoln said, I don't care what problem he has, you guys aren't winning. And his name was Grant."
01:00:14 - 01:00:51 (37 sec),"General Grant. And he went in and he knocked the hell out of everyone. And you know the story. They said to Lincoln, you can't use him anymore. He's an alcoholic. And Lincoln said, I don't care if he's an alcoholic. Frankly, give me six or seven more just like him. He started to win. Grant really did. He had a serious problem."
01:00:51 - 01:01:13 (22 sec),"Serious drinking problem. But, man, was he a good general. And he's finally being recognized as a great general. But Lincoln had almost developed a phobia, because he was having a hard time with a true great fighter and a great general, Robert E. Lee. But Grant figured it out, and Grant is a great general, and Grant came from right here."
01:01:13 - 01:01:46 (33 sec),"Ulysses S. Grant. Ohio is the state that gave us the Wright Brothers. It gave us Neil Armstrong. He's the man that planted the flag -- think of that -- on the face of the moon. Who's that? Who are they -- a relative of -- oh, that's nice. They weren't worried about not planting a flag, right? You know them."
01:01:46 - 01:02:38 (51 sec),"He planted that flag, that American flag right on the face of the moon. There was no kneeling. There was no nothing. There was no games. There was no games. Boom. Wrong, right? Right, fellas? My military guys up here. Of course, my -- excuse me. Excuse me. My military folks all over this arena. And how do you like the fact that the V.A. now has choice, right?"
01:02:38 - 01:03:02 (24 sec),"I said it. But, you know, I skip over it. For 44 years, they've been trying to get choice, and we got it done. That means instead of waiting for 10 days or 5 days or 22 days or 33 days, or 2 months, our great veterans, some of them would be fine, just not feeling so good by the time they saw the doctor. It took so long, they would have a terminal illness."
01:03:02 - 01:03:31 (29 sec),"That's how bad it was. And I got done what they'd been trying to do for 44 years, I think. Forty-four years. Now when they have to wait, they go out, they get the services of a good private doctor, we pay the bill, and they're all better, and that's nice. Forty-four years. It took 44 years to get that done."
01:03:31 - 01:03:56 (25 sec),"I'm just saying that because I see these great military guys. That's pretty much appreciated, fellas, right? That's a big difference. It's a big difference. Made a lot of people very happy. Probably cost us less money. I don't care about that in this case. I care about taking care of our veterans. It's about time."
01:03:56 - 01:04:41 (45 sec),"Generations of Ohio workers farm the fields, poured the incredible steel, fought the battles that made America into the most powerful and prosperous nation in the history of the world. We lost our way. But now we've gained our way back again, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. These courageous Ohio patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage."
01:04:41 - 01:05:14 (33 sec),"We didn't do that. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. That's all we're going to do is win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down."
01:05:14 - 01:05:43 (28 sec),"We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
01:05:43 - 01:06:13 (30 sec),"And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:23 (24 sec),Please. Thank you very much. You can sit. [Laughter] It's great to be with you. And I want to thank Chief Dekmar for that wonderful introduction and for your lifetime of distinguished service. A very special friend of mine.
00:00:23 - 00:00:52 (29 sec),"I'm thrilled to be here in the great state of Florida, with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. On behalf of all Americans, I want to express our eternal gratitude for what you do every single day to protect our families, defend our streets, and take down criminals. And what you do is keep America safe, and nobody does it better than you. Thank you very much. Thank you."
00:00:52 - 00:01:12 (20 sec),"And I also want to thank your amazing families. Because you know that, without them, you couldn't do it. And they're here. And they are indeed fantastic people. So thank you to the families. Appreciate it very much."
00:01:12 - 00:01:43 (31 sec),"We are thrilled to be joined today by a true friend of law enforcement, Governor Rick Scott. And I will tell you that Rick has been incredible when it comes to law enforcement. Anytime you need funds from the federal government, he's on the phone. ""Mr. President, we need more funds."" ""What's it for this time, Rick?"" [Laughter] ""It's for law enforcement."" And I say, ""You got them."""
00:01:43 - 00:01:57 (14 sec),"And speaking of that -- oh, you got them. You got them. When law enforcement wants it -- and they always -- they're reasonable. They want it. And what you do is so incredible."
00:01:57 - 00:02:04 (8 sec),"So I just want to say, Rick is a tremendous governor, and he is your biggest fan. So thank you very much."
00:02:04 - 00:02:19 (15 sec),"And also, another one of your big fans, I will tell you that, is Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is with us today. And thank you, Pam. Thank you very much, wherever you may be. She's in this big room someplace. Thank you. Incredible woman."
00:02:19 - 00:02:40 (21 sec),"Thank you as well to our Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for being here. Flew down together. The press wants to know, ""What did you talk about?"" [Laughter] But we had a very good talk, I will say it. That became a very big story, actually, folks. [Laughter] We had a good talk."
00:02:40 - 00:03:18 (37 sec),"As Hurricane Michael nears landfall, we are working with state and local officials in Florida to take all necessary precautions. And we urge all residents to be prepared and to heed local officials. I told Rick Scott that we are ready for you. We have already briefed FEMA, and FEMA is getting prepared. And it looks like a big one. Can you believe it? It looks like another big one. But we've handled them well. We have handled them very well. And that includes the one that just left us in Florida. It never ends."
00:03:18 - 00:03:31 (14 sec),"But we're all prepared, and hopefully it won't be as bad as it's looking. It looked, to me -- looked, a couple of days ago, like it was not going to be much. And now, it's looking like it could be a very big one. So we're prepared. And good luck."
00:03:31 - 00:03:55 (23 sec),"Today, I also want to extend my very special thanks to Orlando Chief John Mina and the entire Orlando Police Department for hosting us in this great city. John. Where is John? Thank you, John. Great job. Great city. Safe city, too, John. Thank you very much. Great job."
00:03:55 - 00:04:26 (32 sec),"I also want to thank the board of IACP, and congratulations to your incoming President, Chief Paul Cell. Where is Chief? Chief. Good, Chief. I have a lot of respect for the Chief; I know the Chief. That means I guess I have to be here next year, Chief. Is that right? [Laughter] Looking like that, right? That's okay. For you guys, anything I can do, I'll do."
00:04:26 - 00:04:54 (28 sec),"Very importantly -- I want to recognize our law enforcement partners from around the world who have traveled here to share their experiences and to strengthen the vital cooperation that we all practice together. We have great, great cooperation all over the world. We deeply value your friendship and your partnership, and thank you very much for being here. Thank you."
00:04:54 - 00:05:11 (16 sec),"This year, we proudly celebrate the 125th anniversary of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. It's a great group."
00:05:11 - 00:05:35 (25 sec),"Today, I stand before you, as the President of the United States, to tell you that my administration will always honor, cherish, and support the men and women in blue. And we are proud to do it."
00:05:35 - 00:05:48 (13 sec),"Working together, we have achieved extraordinary progress in the fight against violent crime. We understand that reducing crime begins with respecting law enforcement."
00:05:48 - 00:06:01 (13 sec),"For too many years, we have watched politicians escalate political attacks on our courageous police officers. And I've never seen it more than over the last few years. It's disgraceful."
00:06:01 - 00:06:29 (28 sec),"Politicians who spread this dangerous anti-police sentiment make life easier for criminals and more dangerous for law-abiding citizens. And they also make it more dangerous for police. And it must stop, and it must stop now."
00:06:29 - 00:07:07 (39 sec),"Before I took office less than two years ago, our nation was experiencing a historic surge in violent crime. In 2015, 2016, an additional 128,000 violent crimes were committed nationwide compared to the two previous years. That's a tremendous number of additional crime. Over the same period, we witnessed the steepest two-year consecutive increase in murders in nearly half a century."
00:07:07 - 00:07:32 (24 sec),"But we are turning that tide around very rapidly, as you all know in this room. We are taking back our streets from drug lords, gangs, and crimes. We are being tough. We're being smart. By the end of this year, murders in major cities are estimated to drop by close to 10 percent from their levels in 2016."
00:07:32 - 00:07:53 (21 sec),And I have directed the Attorney General's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave. We want to straighten it out. We want to straighten it out fast. There's no reason for what's going on there.
00:07:53 - 00:08:21 (29 sec),"I've told them to work with local authorities to try to change the terrible deal the city of Chicago entered into with ACLU, which ties law enforcement's hands; and to strongly consider stop-and-frisk. It works, and it was meant for problems like Chicago. It was meant for it. Stop-and-frisk."
00:08:21 - 00:08:47 (25 sec),"And Rudy Giuliani, when he was mayor of New York City, had a very strong program of stop-and-frisk. And it went from an unacceptably dangerous city to one of the safest cities in the country -- and, I think, the safest big city in the country. So it works. It's got to be properly applied, but stop-and-frisk works."
00:08:47 - 00:09:20 (34 sec),"The crime spree is a terrible blight on that city, and we'll do everything possible to get it done. I know the law enforcement people in Chicago, and I know how good they are. They could solve the problem if they were simply allowed to do their job and do their job properly. And that's what they want to do. So, Chicago, we're going to start working with you, as of today. Thank you."
00:09:20 - 00:09:32 (11 sec),"In the Fiscal Year 2018, my administration brought charges against more federal firearm defendants and more violent criminals than ever before in the history of our country."
00:09:32 - 00:09:43 (11 sec),"And to help former inmates become law-abiding and productive members of society, we are also working on a prison reform bill -- a very, very big and comprehensive one."
00:09:43 - 00:10:02 (18 sec),"And the best thing that could happen, I think we've already done: We have record numbers of jobs right now in the United States. There has never been a time when more people are working in our country than right now."
00:10:02 - 00:10:21 (20 sec),And our unemployment numbers in almost every category are at record lows. They are record lows. African American -- best in history. Asian American -- best in history. Hispanic American -- best in history. We are doing incredibly well as a -- as an economy.
00:10:21 - 00:10:40 (19 sec),"And that's a great thing when you talk about people coming out of prison -- unable to get a job, totally unable to get a job; it's a hopeless situation. Now, they're getting jobs -- to a certain extent and to a large extent because we're doing so well, and employers are forced to take people that they maybe wouldn't have done."
00:10:40 - 00:11:02 (21 sec),"And some of those employers call me and get back to me. And they say, ""Mr. President, it's amazing how good these people are."" And not all of them -- not all of anybody or any category is going to be great. But tremendous response. And these people have been given a second or even, in some cases, a third shot at it. And they're doing really well."
00:11:02 - 00:11:22 (20 sec),"So the economy being so great, and the jobs picture being so strong -- people are getting an opportunity, and they're doing an incredible job. So I just want to thank everybody in law enforcement. I know you agree with me on this. It's a great thing."
00:11:22 - 00:11:36 (14 sec),"And in particular, I have to thank the IACP for working with us on this effort and for endorsing important prison reform legislation all over the country. And we're doing federal legislation, but all over the country. You folks have been fantastic."
00:11:36 - 00:12:01 (25 sec),"Every single day of my administration, we will stand for law, order, and justice. Just two days ago, the Senate confirmed a supremely qualified nominee who will be a faithful defender of the rule of law -- and will defend the United States Constitution -- the newest Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh."
00:12:01 - 00:12:37 (35 sec),"And I will tell you, when I decided on Brett -- and we have tremendous talent in our legal system. But I decided on Brett. I said, ""He's flawless. He's a flawless person."" The best student. The best scholar. The great intellect. Incredible record over many years. And yet, he's a young man."
00:12:37 - 00:13:06 (29 sec),"I said, ""Brett, congratulations. This is going to be a piece of cake getting you confirmed."" [Laughter] ""This is going to be so easy. It should go quickly, nicely. Don't even worry."" He was so thankful. [Laughter] He said, ""Mr. President, it's the greatest honor of my life -- United States Supreme Court. The greatest of my life."""
00:13:06 - 00:13:37 (31 sec),"So I haven't heard him say that again to me, but I think he still believes it. [Laughter] But he's a great person, and it was very, very unfair what happened to him -- false charges, false accusations, horrible statements that were totally untrue that he knew nothing about. Frankly, terms that he probably never heard in his life. He was this. He was that. He'd never even heard of these terms. It was a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evil."
00:13:37 - 00:14:11 (34 sec),"And he toughed it out. We all toughed it out together. And I have to thank the Republican senators that fought so hard for this because it wasn't easy. And it was a great honor to be involved in this situation. A lot of people would have said, ""Oh, let's give it up. Let's go a different direction."" We don't give up. You don't give up. We don't give up. Just don't do it. He's going to be a great Supreme Court justice -- watch. A great one. He will be a great one."
00:14:11 - 00:14:30 (19 sec),"We will perform the swearing-in tonight at 7 p.m., at the White House. That's very exciting. So I leave here, and I go home, and I swear in a man who will be a truly great United States Supreme Court Justice. That's going to be my honor. Thank you."
00:14:30 - 00:14:58 (28 sec),"And I'm going to tell him about the spontaneous applause. Before I even finished -- you people. [Laughter] Because you knew what I was about to say, but I didn't even say it. And you started before I completed. So that's the kind of -- all over the country, I'm doing rallies, and people are loving that man and loving that choice. So I think we're all going to be very happy."
00:14:58 - 00:15:24 (26 sec),"In order to keep every American safe, we are also making officer safety a top priority. In 2016, an officer was assaulted in America on an average of every 9 minutes. Is this even believable?"
00:15:24 - 00:16:00 (36 sec),"Last week, seven officers were shot in Florence, South Carolina -- incredible state. One was killed; numerous were really badly injured. Our hearts break for the family of fallen Officer Terrence Carraway. We pray for his loved ones and for the officers who are still recovering. When a police officer is assaulted or killed, it is a wound inflicted upon our entire nation. It is."
00:16:00 - 00:16:43 (43 sec),"And I have to say this, I don't think you understand one thing: how much our country loves you and the job you do. You don't hear it from them. You don't hear it from them. They don't tell you the real feeling. They don't tell you the true feeling, but I know the true feeling. I know the true feeling. You don't hear it from the media, but I can tell you, I know the feeling. And these people -- the people of our country love you. So I just want you to know it direct."
00:16:43 - 00:16:44 (1 sec),"We love you, Trump!"
00:16:44 - 00:16:56 (12 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I love him, too. He's just not my type, I'm sorry. [Laughter] He's not my type. Thank you."
00:16:56 - 00:17:09 (14 sec),One of my very first actions as President was to direct my administration to take all necessary action to protect law enforcement from acts of violence against all of you.
00:17:09 - 00:17:25 (16 sec),"We believe that criminals who kill our police officers should immediately, with trial -- but rapidly as possible; not 15 years later, 20 years later -- get the death penalty."
00:17:25 - 00:18:22 (57 sec),"And importantly, we are also making sure you have the equipment you need to do the job. That's why we are allowing local police to access surplus military equipment. And we've been doing this since the very first day of my administration, whereas others didn't want you to have that equipment for very strange reasons. [Laughter] They said it looked too tough, it looked too strong; it's not a good look. You have people shooting at you, and they're worried about your look. [Laughter] Someday you'll explain that one to me, please. I don't quite get it. Explain it."
00:18:22 - 00:18:43 (21 sec),"This equipment doesn't only protect your lives and safety, it protects the lives and safety of every citizen that you serve. During Hurricane Harvey, surplus military equipment helped rescue more than 9,000 people."
00:18:43 - 00:18:59 (17 sec),"We are also taking unprecedented action to help our local police fight the worst drug epidemic in our history -- the opioid crisis -- which took nearly 50,000 American lives last year."
00:18:59 - 00:19:15 (16 sec),"We have secured the most funding in history to give you the tools and resources that you need to hunt down the traffickers, stop these poisonous drugs from coming into our country, and to save American lives."
00:19:15 - 00:19:42 (27 sec),"In fact, today I'm announcing another $42.4 million for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program to attack this epidemic. This grant funding will go to more than 50 innovative projects targeting the greatest drug threats facing the United States."
00:19:42 - 00:20:00 (18 sec),"And I will tell you that, last year in the budget -- this year also -- last year, we got $6 billion -- $6 billion -- to work on the opioid problem at every level, including people -- really helping people that are in need of help."
00:20:00 - 00:20:17 (17 sec),"Last year, we increased the average federal sentence for drug trafficking to its highest level since 2013. For the first time in years, we are ensuring there are real, tough consequences for those who flood our streets with deadly poison."
00:20:17 - 00:20:42 (25 sec),"Thanks to your partnership, last year, our brave ICE agents seized 1 million pounds of narcotics, including almost 7,000 pounds of heroin and more than 2,300 pounds of fentanyl -- saving thousands upon thousands of American lives. And this year, we're way ahead of those numbers."
00:20:42 - 00:21:09 (27 sec),"Last year alone, ICE removed nearly 130,000 criminal aliens from our country. And, as you know, my competitors don't like that. They don't like that. That's the other thing you're going to have to explain to me someday. Including thousands of vicious gang members and MS-13 predators. They're gone. They're gone."
00:21:09 - 00:21:50 (41 sec),"Yet, these brave ICE officers have been subjected to shameless attacks by leading members of the Democrat Party, including outrageous calls to abolish ICE. And also, they're not a big help to us in law enforcement. They don't want to give us the kind of funds that you people are requesting. But you're getting them anyway because we're giving them to you. But they fight us at every turn. The Democrats fight us at every single turn. Whether it's law enforcement or military, they fight us at every turn. But we win."
00:21:50 - 00:22:04 (14 sec),"We condemn the vilification of law enforcement and law enforcement officers, and we stand proudly with the heroes of ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement in general."
00:22:04 - 00:22:29 (25 sec),"We also strongly oppose efforts from politicians to shackle local police departments and prevent them from cooperating with their federal partners. So let's see whether or not Chicago -- as an example, locally -- accepts help. They need it. And we'll straighten it out fast. We're going to straighten it out fast."
00:22:29 - 00:22:37 (8 sec),"I assume they want to straighten it out. Sometimes I think, ""Maybe is it possible that they don't?"" But we're going to be there. We're going to try and help them."
00:22:37 - 00:22:54 (17 sec),"Every day, these sanctuary city policies force the release of criminal aliens and gang members right back onto our streets, putting innocent civilians at grave risk -- many people being killed."
00:22:54 - 00:23:22 (28 sec),"I will fight every day for your right to cooperate with federal law enforcement and to protect your communities as you wish. And I know most of you in this room -- I think probably everybody in this room -- works brilliantly with our federal authorities. And it's our honor to do it -- including funding, by the way -- including funding. Thank you."
00:23:22 - 00:23:56 (34 sec),"Last week, my administration also provided historic levels of funding to improve school safety. Through STOP School Violence grants, we are giving local schools and police departments the resources they need to hire more officers, and train more teachers, and better detect and address early warning signs of mental illness before it's too late. I made a lot of strides in the last year. Heavy funding -- but you've made a lot of strides."
00:23:56 - 00:24:11 (15 sec),"In every action we take, we are defending American safety and treasuring the extraordinary -- I mean, we're just helping as much as we can the extraordinary men and women who protect our communities."
00:24:11 - 00:24:22 (11 sec),Here with us today are all four nominees for the IACP Police Officer of the Year Award.
00:24:22 - 00:25:06 (44 sec),"Officer Taylor Rust serves with the Plano, Texas Police Department. Good place. Where's Taylor? Taylor. Where's Taylor? Come on up here, Taylor. Run up here. They'll let you up. Come on up. We'll get all of them up. Come on."
00:25:06 - 00:25:17 (11 sec),"A year ago, Taylor raced to the scene of an active shooter in a neighborhood, entered the house without any backup at all, and shot and killed the murderer -- it turned out to be somebody with a lot of bad past -- saving the lives of four civilians."
00:25:17 - 00:25:40 (23 sec),"Officer Rust, we salute you and your remarkable courage. You are a great gentleman. Stay up here with me, okay? Say -- come on, say couple of words."
00:25:40 - 00:25:48 (8 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. You'll have to forgive me, I'm much more comfortable in the situation Mr. President described than being up here. [Laughter]"
00:25:48 - 00:25:59 (11 sec),"It's a tremendous honor for me to be here. I appreciate everything IACP has done for us, my family. My wife, Amber, is here. She's been a tremendous support, as well, through this whole thing."
00:25:59 - 00:26:14 (15 sec),"It's been a very humbling experience for me, and it's been an honor to be spoken in the same breath with the other three officers that are sitting over there today. Thank you very much."
00:26:14 - 00:26:29 (15 sec),"That was a good job. He'll be running for office soon. You watch. [Laughter] Thank you very much, Taylor."
00:26:29 - 00:26:51 (22 sec),"Last May, Officer Mark Dallas was on duty at Dixon High School, in Illinois, when he heard gunshots. Within -- listen to this -- three seconds, he was at the scene, right outside the auditorium where the entire senior class was gathered and was in a lot of trouble."
00:26:51 - 00:27:22 (31 sec),"The shooter fled and fired shots at him, but Officer Dallas chased him down before a single student was injured. Officer Dallas's son Joshua was one of the seniors inside that auditorium. Afterwards, Joshua said, ""I wasn't scared for my life at all because I knew my dad would protect us."" How good is that?"
00:27:22 - 00:27:32 (10 sec),"Thank you, Officer Dallas. Where are you? Officer Dallas, come on up here. That's pretty good. That's pretty good."
00:27:32 - 00:27:44 (13 sec),So his son had a little confidence in him. That's not bad. That's beautiful. Beautiful.
00:27:44 - 00:27:58 (14 sec),"Public speaking is not my best, but I'm -- I'm extremely nervous. [Laughter] Mr. President, I appreciate everything, and the support you give us. And I'm honored to be here with the IACP and the other nominees."
00:27:58 - 00:28:05 (7 sec),"My son said he wasn't scared because dad was out there. I was ""dad"" to 182 other kids in that gymnasium."
00:28:05 - 00:28:18 (13 sec),I just want to say thank you. I'm honored and blessed to be here. Thank you.
00:28:18 - 00:28:28 (10 sec),Beautiful story. Thank you very much. That's a beautiful story. And your son was right.
00:28:28 - 00:29:01 (33 sec),"In October of last year, Washington State Trooper Nathaniel Dawson pursued a car that violated a traffic law. When the car stopped, two gunmen began shooting at Trooper Dawson, and shooting very violently. Despite heavy fire, Trooper Dawson got out of his vehicle and fired back until the shooters ran away and were later apprehended. They were very dangerous criminals."
00:29:01 - 00:29:12 (10 sec),"Our streets are safer, and our criminals recoil in fear because of brave officers like Trooper Dawson. And I want to thank you. Come up, please, Trooper Dawson."
00:29:12 - 00:29:38 (26 sec),Wow. It's a great honor to be here tonight. Thank you all for coming -- Mr. President. I think we all would say the same: We're just doing our job. And to be recognized is just extra. So thank you again.
00:29:38 - 00:30:00 (22 sec),"Thank you very much. Thank you. These people have a lot of respect for you. They don't sit down when you're up here. [Laughter] They have a lot of respect, right? That's great. Beautiful."
00:30:00 - 00:30:29 (29 sec),"Finally, Sergeant Luis Celis of the Doral -- I know it well -- Florida Police Department -- they are fantastic -- responded to the call that you all read about -- a big story at the time -- that a shooter was in the lobby of Trump National Doral. Can you believe this is happening to me? And I didn't say, ""Put this manâ¦"" I knew what he did. But they put him. Threatening a lot of people that were in the hotel, including the employees."
00:30:29 - 00:30:50 (21 sec),"Sergeant Celis entered the building, engaged in a vicious shooting attack, and captured the criminal before anyone was hurt -- which was incredible, actually."
00:30:50 - 00:31:12 (22 sec),"Sergeant Celis, that was really a job well done. People are still talking about it. It was an amazing job. Please come up."
00:31:12 - 00:31:23 (12 sec),I guess he's a tough act to follow -- [Laughter] -- what the guy said over here.
00:31:23 - 00:31:40 (16 sec),"Thanks everybody for being here. My wife, Olga. And congratulations to everybody else. Thank you."
00:31:40 - 00:31:51 (11 sec),"And just to conclude, I have to say, in each of these stories we see the unmatched strength, and character, and courage of our amazing heroes in blue."
00:31:51 - 00:32:15 (24 sec),"Every day, our police officers race into darkened allies and deserted streets, and onto the doorsteps of the most hardened criminals -- people you don't want to be dealing with. And you deal with them well. Incredible. They see the worst of humanity, and they respond with the best of the American spirit."
00:32:15 - 00:32:38 (23 sec),"America's police officers have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. In moments of danger and despair, you are the reason we never lose hope -- because there are men and women in uniform who face down evil and stand for all that's good and just and decent and right."
00:32:38 - 00:32:56 (18 sec),"No matter what threat you face, you never give in. You never back down. You are people of tremendous courage and strength. We appreciate it. Appreciate it."
00:32:56 - 00:33:11 (15 sec),Nothing can break your spirit or bend your will -- I've seen it over many years -- because you are the proud men and women of law enforcement.
00:33:11 - 00:33:23 (11 sec),"We thank you. We salute you. We honor you. And we promise you: We will always have your back. Now and forever, we will have your back."
00:33:23 - 00:33:51 (28 sec),"So it's my great honor to be with you today, and I thank you and I thank everyone in this incredible room of heroes -- the International Association of Chiefs of Police. You have very, very special, very smart, very brave, brave people."
00:33:51 - 00:34:06 (15 sec),And on behalf of our incredible country -- our country that's getting stronger and bigger and richer and just better -- we're making it greater. [Laughter] And that's okay. It's greater. We're making it greater.
00:34:06 - 00:34:21 (15 sec),"I want to say God bless you, God bless your families, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:15 (16 sec),"Thank you, folks. I've paid you so much money over the years. David, I've given them so much money. That's all right. And you did a good job. Please."
00:00:15 - 00:00:25 (10 sec),"As a memento for us of him being here, we have created him a hardhat with the Presidential Seal, the American flag, NECA, and our convention logo. You could use this in Washington from time to time. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:00:25 - 00:01:04 (39 sec),"I will use it. I will. That's beautiful. Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you. I don't want to put it on because I'm afraid that I'll mess up my hair. That would be terrible. [Laughter] Did I have a good hair day? Or -- I don't know. Yes? Come on. [Laughter] Got to do it. Thank you, man. Is it still okay? I think so."
00:01:04 - 00:01:19 (15 sec),"Thank you, everybody. Please sit down. And it is true -- I told David, ""David, I paid these guys so much money over the years, built so many beautiful buildings."" And you know what? The job you do is incredible."
00:01:19 - 00:01:38 (19 sec),"I'd go to some of those switchboards and I'd go to some of those connectors, and I said, ""These are smart people. Putting that together, these are smart..."" -- and you are, you're smart people and you're talented people. Few people could do what you do, that I can tell you. So, thank you. Thank you. That's true."
00:01:38 - 00:01:58 (21 sec),"And thank you, David. I'm thrilled to be in the great city of Philadelphia. I went to college here at the Wharton School of Finance -- U of Penn -- with thousands of our nation's most skilled and talented workers -- the electrical contractors who make our country run. So true."
00:01:58 - 00:02:19 (21 sec),"I also know from firsthand experience, America's electrical contractors are the best in the world. Nobody even close. And now -- that's true. Nobody close. And now, you have a friend and an ally in the White House. And you do. You have a friend."
00:02:19 - 00:02:56 (37 sec),"I want to thank John Grau, Dan Walter, Mark Mazur -- well, that's a very interesting name, Greg Rick. Where -- who's Greg Rick? Where's Greg? [Laughter] Stand up. I love that name. ""Greg Rick."" They have a lot of problem back-and-forth, I'll bet, huh? Over your life, huh? [Laughter] They call you ""Rick""; they call you ""Greg."" [Laughter] And he's a good man. And the incredible leadership team at the National Electrical Contractors Association. You have great leadership."
00:02:56 - 00:03:06 (10 sec),"With your help, we will protect this noble trade for many generations to come. And you're protecting it yourself with your talent."
00:03:06 - 00:03:28 (22 sec),I also want to thank a very special group of people who always get the job done and get it done right -- the proud members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Thank you very much. Thank you.
00:03:28 - 00:03:38 (9 sec),"And speaking of energy, we are honored to be joined by Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- where's Rick? He's around here. Stand up, Rick. Great job he's doing. Doing a great job."
00:03:38 - 00:04:02 (25 sec),"And Alex Acosta, as you know, Secretary of Labor. Alex. Thank you, Alex. He just developed two incredible healthcare plans that really work and they're really popular. Thank you very much, Alex."
00:04:02 - 00:04:24 (21 sec),"As well as two tremendous leaders from Pennsylvania, Congressmen G.T. Thompson and the great Lou Barletta -- going to be your next senator I hope. Thank you. Thank you, G.T. Thank you, G.T. And thank you, Lou. What a job you're doing."
00:04:24 - 00:04:37 (13 sec),"I'll tell you what, if he's your next senator, you're going to have no more problems. He is a doer. So, I'm very proud of you, man. Great job. And I hear you're doing well, and I'm proud."
00:04:37 - 00:04:46 (9 sec),"Also here with us are members of the Mississippi congressional delegation. In fact, I'm going there with the delegation. I'll be there tonight."
00:04:46 - 00:04:59 (13 sec),"People say, ""Where do you get this energy?"" You know where I get it? I love doing it, actually. If you love doing it, it's easy. Right, David? If you don't like doing it, not so good."
00:04:59 - 00:05:30 (31 sec),"Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith -- where's Cindy? Cindy. Thank you, Cindy. I hear you're doing really well. A man who always does well, Senator Roger Wicker. Roger. Been a great friend of mine from the beginning. Thank you, Roger. And Representative Gregg Harper. Thanks, Gregg. Thank you, Gregg."
00:05:30 - 00:05:44 (14 sec),"This is really an incredible time for our nation. We are respected again. We are respected again, like we haven't been respected in many, many decades."
00:05:44 - 00:06:17 (33 sec),"We have the best economy in our history. Stock market today just hit another record high. That's the hundred -- I think its 103 times since I'm President that we've hit a new high. And hopefully, next year at this time we'll hit many more. But that's not a bad number, right? I think we're up to 103. And if I'm off just by a little bit -â like if it's 102 -- it'll be headlines. ""Trump exaggerated."" [Laughter] That's why I always say ""I think it's around..."""
00:06:17 - 00:06:29 (12 sec),"With a Republican Congress, we've added more than 4 million new jobs since Election Day, and lifted 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Those are tremendous numbers."
00:06:29 - 00:07:00 (32 sec),"Jobless claims are at a 50-year low. And the stock market, as I just said, is at an all-time high today. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have all recently achieved their lowest levels ever recorded. That's pretty good."
00:07:00 - 00:07:24 (23 sec),"That's a very hard soundbite to beat, right, if you're the opponent of Trump? When you say ""highest and best numbers we've ever had."" And we have created over 50,000 new jobs in electrical contracting. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Nobody thought that was going to be happening. And it's going way up. It's going up very fast."
00:07:24 - 00:07:44 (21 sec),America's â- and just remember this â- America's economic revival would not be possible without the men and women in this room. Would not be possible. I've built so much. I've done so much business with you. I've watched the things you've done and it's incredible.
00:07:44 - 00:08:06 (21 sec),"We are truly grateful to our electricians, our wiremen, linemen, engineers, technicians, journeymen, contractors, and apprentices â- oh, I love that word. That was a great -- I love the word ""apprentice."" I love that word."
00:08:06 - 00:08:16 (10 sec),"You know, I did that show 14 seasons, and then I left. They wanted to sign me for three more seasons. I said, ""No, I'm going to run for President."" [Laughter] It's true."
00:08:16 - 00:08:28 (12 sec),"So they replaced me with a big, big movie star. And it didn't last too well. It was gone like â- quickly. But I love that name. ""The Apprentice."""
00:08:28 - 00:08:53 (24 sec),"Who keep the engine of American prosperity running full speed ahead. We're also fixing decades of disastrous trade deals that have plundered our factories and stolen our wealth and our jobs. What's happened here over the last 20, 25 years, and more is horrible."
00:08:53 - 00:09:11 (18 sec),"But we're changing it all. We've added 400,000 new manufacturing jobs since the election. And that number, very shortly, will be up, David, to 640,000. Big things are happening currently."
00:09:11 - 00:09:25 (14 sec),"And if you remember, the past administration said those are jobs that you're not going to be adding. ""You're going to need a magic wand."" Do you remember that? Magic wand. There was no magic wand; it's good policy and other things."
00:09:25 - 00:09:37 (13 sec),We are in the midst of a manufacturing renaissance â- something which nobody thought you'd hear â- which means more jobs for our great electrical contractors.
00:09:37 - 00:10:05 (27 sec),"Yesterday, we made history by announcing an incredible, brand new trade deal to replace the horrible NAFTA deal that drained our country of jobs and companies. As I have said many times -- NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made in any country at any time."
00:10:05 - 00:10:19 (14 sec),And now we have a great trade deal. And we have deal that is also good for Mexico and good for Canada. And we have a good partnership with the three. And it worked out. It all worked out.
00:10:19 - 00:10:33 (15 sec),"As you probably noticed, and read, and saw, there were a little tough negotiations. But you know what? It all worked out. And we're now on the right track. And we did a great deal with South Korea. It's all working out."
00:10:33 - 00:10:52 (19 sec),"Now, as you probably have heard, we're looking at China and other countries, and we're straightening out some of these horrible deals that stole our wealth, stole our jobs, stole so much from us. Actually, in many ways, stole our dignity as a country."
00:10:52 - 00:11:33 (40 sec),"Our landmark new trade agreement is called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Like YMCA; or United States Marine Corps, with an ""A"" at the end. [Laughter] I liked the way it sounded. I didn't want to use the name ""NAFTA,"" because NAFTA has been so bad for us. I would watch 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago -- you look at New England where the factories were devastated. People forget. People forget. You still have empty buildings all over the country from NAFTA, so I didn't want to use the name ""NAFTA."""
00:11:33 - 00:11:54 (21 sec),"â USMCA is the most advanced, modern, and balanced trade agreement ever negotiated. It is also the largest trade deal the United States has ever made. And we think it's the largest trade deal ever made in the world -- $1.2 trillion in commerce a year."
00:11:54 - 00:12:30 (36 sec),"The USMCA will protect American workers, substantially increase exports of American agriculture. Our farmers are so happy. I spoke with Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa this morning. She was so happy. And the farmers and agricultural people are thrilled. They didn't know if we'd ever be able to make a deal or certainly a fair deal for them. They're thrilled. And this deal will revitalize, also, the American auto industry."
00:12:30 - 00:13:02 (32 sec),"One thing I wanted was, I don't want any incentives to get companies to leave our country; fire everybody; move to Mexico, or Canada, or someplace, and build cars and send them in -- no tax, no nothing; and, in the meantime, we end up with nothing except unemployed people. Not going to happen anymore. That's what I wanted in this deal. It was so important. It was so important."
00:13:02 - 00:13:16 (14 sec),"Do you remember those days? You all remember those days? When everybody was leaving the country? Going to make a product, send it in, and we end up with unemployed. That's about all we got out of it -- no nothing. So those days are over, folks."
00:13:16 - 00:13:39 (23 sec),"Last week, I also stood beside President Moon and announced a new trade deal with South Korea that will increase exports of American-made cars very, very substantially; increase exports of agriculture; and also medicine, which is very big and very important business."
00:13:39 - 00:13:53 (14 sec),"We're preparing to start negotiations, right now, with Japan. And we have taken the toughest-ever actions in our history against China's very abusive trading policies and trade practices."
00:13:53 - 00:14:17 (24 sec),"China has been taking out of our country $500 billion a year and it was time to stop. Nobody ever did it. It's crazy. Nobody ever did it -- $500 billion a year. And we're going to have a great relationship with China, but we have to be fair to ourselves, also."
00:14:17 - 00:14:38 (21 sec),"After years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, and we are doing it with -- American aluminum, American steel, and with our great electrical contractors. It's true. But we're rebuilding our country. Yep."
00:14:38 - 00:14:56 (18 sec),We're committed to revitalizing our infrastructure and strengthening our electrical grid. It's so important.
00:14:56 - 00:15:30 (34 sec),"Last week, I proudly signed legislation to completely rebuild the United States military. We're purchasing the finest equipment on Earth, and it will be all made right here in the USA. We make the best equipment in the world. We make the greatest military equipment in the world -- greatest missiles, greatest rockets, greatest planes, best rifles, best ships. We make the best military equipment, by far, in the world."
00:15:30 - 00:15:50 (20 sec),"And it's made also -- much less importantly, in this case, David -- but it's also made with American jobs, which is very good. Normally jobs is number one. When it comes to military, we'll put jobs at number two. We need the equipment, right? Probably seldom so much as these times."
00:15:50 - 00:16:14 (24 sec),"And interestingly -- I hope we never have to use it -- but you know what assures that, or at least almost assures that? Having the most powerful military, by far, that we've ever had means we'l probably never have to use it. It's very simple. We learned that -- we learned that a long time ago, right? We learned that a long time ago."
00:16:14 - 00:16:48 (34 sec),"Another critical element of national security is energy security. And, Rick Perry, you're doing a great job. I'm proud of you. Very proud of you. He was the governor of Texas for 12 years. He was not only a great governor; he was a great cheerleader. And he ran for President -- he was nasty against me, wasn't he, though? Wow. [Laughter] He was tough. And you're doing great, Rick. We appreciate it very much."
00:16:48 - 00:17:12 (24 sec),We are now the single largest producer of oil and gas anywhere in the world. This was very recent. Took a lot of regulations off. We have plenty left. But we took regulations off which allowed us to do things that we would never have been able to do. Think of it: We're the single-largest producer of energy in the world. Did you ever think you were going to hear that? This all happened very quickly.
00:17:12 - 00:17:32 (20 sec),"We've ended the war on clean, beautiful, Pennsylvenle [Pennsylvania] -- hey -- your clean, beautiful, Pennsylvania coal. Right? It's beautiful. It's clean. What they can do with coal today is incredible. And we have more of it than anybody in the world and we're producing energy-rich Pennsylvania shale."
00:17:32 - 00:18:00 (28 sec),"To get you more contracts and more jobs, we've slashed a record number of regulations. And we've approved immediately -- like first day, first week -- the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipelines. That's 48,000 jobs in one day. Boom, boom. Had to sign something."
00:18:00 - 00:18:21 (21 sec),"Those companies have never had it so good. That was dead. Both of them were dead. And I came along. I think it could've been my first day, Rick. Right? But close. And we signed it -- 48,000 jobs immediately. And better than riding it on top, on the railroads. Better environmentally. You know, they talk about the environment."
00:18:21 - 00:18:38 (17 sec),"And right now, our air is record clean. And our water is crystal clear. And that's what we want. But we don't want stopping jobs. We don't want to do what some people wanted us to do -- mostly, our foreign competitors."
00:18:38 - 00:18:58 (20 sec),"And I've ordered federal agencies to dramatically speed up the federal permitting process so that you can get approvals much more quickly. We have the time down to one half of one half already. It used to take 20 years to get a highway approved; we're close to two years, and I'd like to get it down to one."
00:18:58 - 00:19:16 (18 sec),"And that doesn't mean they're going to approve it. But if they're not going to approve it, somebody doesn't have to give up their entire life going through an approval process only to have a 3 to 2 vote -- ""we're not going to approve it."" So, we're going to be close to one year, from twenty."
00:19:16 - 00:19:48 (32 sec),"My administration has also taken historic action to make healthcare more affordable. Through Association Health Plans -- that's Alex -- we are allowing businesses to band together and to buy much more affordable insurance for their employees, including across state lines -- meaning you have tremendous competition. You have to see these insurance companies. They're going crazy -- sort of like the fake news media. They're going crazy. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:19:48 - 00:19:56 (8 sec),"I used the term last night ""loco"" -- in order to get the business -- meaning you're getting good deals. They're getting great deals."
00:19:56 - 00:20:10 (13 sec),"We opened up short-term, limited-duration plans so that individuals can buy the plan they want and the plan that they need at tremendously reduced costs. We've done great with that."
00:20:10 - 00:20:39 (29 sec),"And we've eliminated much of Obamacare. And most importantly, we've eliminated the individual mandate. It's gone. That was the thing in Obamacare that was just no good, where you paid a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay a fortune to have bad health care. Right? You know, guys are paying thousands of dollars so they don't have to buy healthcare. We've gotten rid of it. Gone. That was a big one."
00:20:39 - 00:21:01 (22 sec),"Thanks to our actions, I am pleased to announce that, for the first time since Obamacare was passed, premiums are not going to go up next year. We have done everything in the book. They are actually going to go down somewhat. And if we weren't here, if you had another administration -- they were going up another 122 percent, 153 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent."
00:21:01 - 00:21:17 (15 sec),"And you look at what we've done, just through management of healthcare, and it's not good stuff but we've keep the premiums down to the lowest number that they've been. So we're very happy with that. A lot of people are very happy with that. Thank you."
00:21:17 - 00:21:55 (39 sec),"And we're strongly protecting your Medicare. We oppose efforts from Democrats to raid Medicare to fund socialism, robbing seniors of their benefits. Medicare belongs to the seniors who have earned it and paid into it for their entire lives. They want to take it away -- the Democrats. And we will always protect Americans with preexisting conditions. That's a major part of what I'm all about."
00:21:55 - 00:22:33 (38 sec),"At the heart of our economic revival are the massive tax cuts passed by Republicans in Congress. We didn't get one Democrat vote. And those tax cuts are one of the reasons the economy is doing so well. But you're talking about a lot of money in the pockets of everybody in this room. A typical family of four earning $75,000, as an example, will see an income tax cut of more than $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half, and, in many cases, much more than that. Big difference."
00:22:33 - 00:22:44 (11 sec),And small businesses can now deduct 20 percent of their business income -- one of the most significant small business tax cuts in the history of our country. Very big cut. Big incentive.
00:22:44 - 00:23:07 (22 sec),"Capital investments are soaring because you can now immediately deduct every penny spent on new equipment. You can do one-year expensing. Nobody thought that was ever going to happen. In fact, I should leave and go back into business maybe. If you would have told me that when I was a private businessman, maybe I wouldn't have run for President."
00:23:07 - 00:23:35 (28 sec),"One-year -- think of it -- one-year expensing. Normally, you write it off over 30, 40 years. One-year expensing. That's an incentive to go out and do what you have to do. And I always said that was going to be one of the most important things in the package. That was a small clause that a lot of people didn't talk about. And I said, ""That's going to be one of the most important."""
00:23:35 - 00:24:12 (37 sec),"And bringing back trillions of dollars from overseas -- money that was going to be spent in other parts of the world. Apple is bringing back $230 billion. They're building plants all over the United States, and a great -- from what I hear, a great campus, they call it. So many things are happening. But billions and billions of dollars is being brought back into our country -- money that could never have been brought back under the old system."
00:24:12 - 00:24:21 (10 sec),"And from now on, small business owners will be spared from the deeply unfair estate tax, also known as the ""death tax."""
00:24:21 - 00:24:40 (19 sec),"So if you have a small business or a farm or something -- and you love your kids -- now, if you don't love your kids, it doesn't help you. [Laughter] Because if your kids don't treat you good, don't leave it to them. Give it to somebody else. [Laughter] So it doesn't help."
00:24:40 - 00:25:11 (31 sec),"But if you love your kids, which probably 82 percent of you do -- according to most [Inaudible] -- [Laughter] -- you can now leave your small business or your beautiful little farm or whatever it is that you're so proud of -- you leave it to your kids, and they don't have to go out to the bank and borrow to pay the tax and end up losing it in a foreclosure. It's such a big thing. A lot of people don't talk about it, but we were able to get it."
00:25:11 - 00:25:22 (11 sec),"So the estate tax -- and the death tax, which is sort of the same thing -- but gone -- essentially gone for small business. So that's great. A very big thing."
00:25:22 - 00:26:04 (42 sec),"One of the millions of small businesses that is thriving thanks to tax cuts is Wilson Construction Company in Canby, Oregon. Stacy Wilson runs the business with her family, and she joins us today. Stacy, please come up and tell us about the incredible growth that you've seen since the institution of our tax cuts. Where is Stacy? Go ahead, Stacy. Come on up. From Oregon."
00:26:04 - 00:26:07 (3 sec),"Thank you, Stacy."
00:26:07 - 00:26:09 (2 sec),Thank you. Wow.
00:26:09 - 00:26:09 (0 sec),[Inaudible]
00:26:09 - 00:26:11 (2 sec),Thank you very much. Wow.
00:26:11 - 00:26:14 (3 sec),I'll put that down.
00:26:14 - 00:26:22 (8 sec),"Thank you. Wow. Truly an honor. Thank you so much, Mr. President."
00:26:22 - 00:26:23 (1 sec),It's my honor.
00:26:23 - 00:26:57 (34 sec),"As Mr. President said, my name is Stacy Wilson. We own an electrical contracting company out of Canby, Oregon. We are a midsize company that is family-owned. My grandfather started the company 65 years ago in Oregon and Washington. And my father, Don Wilson, has really made it what it is today -- a nationwide company that specializes in transmission, distribution, and substation projects nationwide."
00:26:57 - 00:27:43 (45 sec),"We employ about 500 employees. And thanks to Mr. Trump and the tax reforms and the general confidence in the economy, I guess, we have really been able to invest more in our employees and grow our company in the last year. We're investing more in employee wages and benefits and bonuses. We're spending millions on equipment and assets. And, in general, we're just seeing a huge increase in work that is coming out because utilities are spending more to update this aging infrastructure."
00:27:43 - 00:27:44 (2 sec),So thank you very much.
00:27:44 - 00:27:47 (2 sec),"Well, thank you so much."
00:27:47 - 00:28:25 (38 sec),"It's made a huge impact. And -- so we are looking to grow about 20 to 30 percent more in employees just in the next few months. We have a lot of large projects that are starting. And this will make, I think, a big difference in -- really, these incentives that are good for businesses are really important for our employees but also the communities we work in. And we've really been thankful and have seen this since President Trump has been in office."
00:28:25 - 00:28:38 (13 sec),"So, thank you so much for this opportunity and this great acknowledgement. I never thought I would be up here, so thank you. [Laughs]"
00:28:38 - 00:28:39 (2 sec),"Thank you, Stacy."
00:28:39 - 00:28:58 (19 sec),"I see that, you know, Stacy comes up -- no notes, no nothing, nothing to read -- and gives a speech better than the politicians, folks. [Laughter] The politicians, they walk up with papers; everything is scripted. They read it. They stutter. Look at her, she's, like, great."
00:28:58 - 00:29:31 (33 sec),"Okay, now she's famous too, so she'll probably become a governor of Oregon. She'll become a governor, or a senator. Great job. Very impressive. That's very impressive."
00:29:31 - 00:29:48 (17 sec),"Another success story in this world, in this great land of ours, is Arcadia Electric in Ridgewood, New York. That's right where I grew up -- right near where I grew up. Company president Steve Gianotti is with us. And, Steve, could you come up and tell us about that great success that you're experiencing, especially recently? Thank you, Steve."
00:29:48 - 00:29:49 (1 sec),"Good afternoon, everyone."
00:29:49 - 00:30:01 (12 sec),"First, I'd like to thank President Trump for his perseverance in helping us with his fiscal policy, which have enabled my company, Arcadia Electric, to bid on more work, and take on more jobs that we're able to do now because we have more coming that's available to us, more than ever before."
00:30:01 - 00:30:30 (29 sec),"And as a result of that, we have been able to keep our 120 people employed. But next year, we anticipate hiring 25 percent more hardworking union workers, middle-class workforce that will -- bring our company to approximately 150 employees, which we're very proud of. They work hard. They're the safest, hardest, union workers. And their professional abilities is what makes us successful."
00:30:30 - 00:31:02 (33 sec),"And for that I have to, again, thank the President of the United States for his perseverance and for enabling us to get this work and to change the regulatory policies that he's been doing -- that he spoke of earlier. This is all helpful to us. So, President Trump, thank you very much."
00:31:02 - 00:31:04 (2 sec),"Thanks. Thank you, Steve. Great job."
00:31:04 - 00:31:30 (26 sec),"We want to give every citizen the opportunity to achieve their American Dream. That's why we're committed to expanding apprenticeships, and on-the-job-training, and vocational education -- you know, a word that you don't hear that much. I'm bringing it back. Because when I was growing up -- I had so many vocational schools, and you don't hear that anymore."
00:31:30 - 00:31:58 (28 sec),"You hear ""junior college."" You hear all sorts of names, but the vocational is what I understood and that's what I like. And I had people that went to school with me, and, in some cases, they weren't great students. But they could take apart an engine blindfolded, put it back together 15 different ways. They were so much more talented than the ""A"" student. We would have been ""D"" students. And that's what they want to do, and that's what they love, and it's called ""vocational."" So we're bringing that word back a lot."
00:31:58 - 00:32:22 (24 sec),"But you have tremendously talented people that are, frankly, making a tremendous living -- making a lot of money. And we love those people. They're very special, so we're bringing back the word ""vocational."" And we're bringing it back strong."
00:32:22 - 00:32:41 (19 sec),"My administration is making a historic investment in workforce development. We established the National Council on the American Worker, and I recently signed a bill to provide more than $1 billion annually for vocational education."
00:32:41 - 00:33:08 (27 sec),"Employers all across the country are signing our Pledge to America's Workers, expanding job opportunities for more than 4.2 million Americans. And that number is soon going to reach 10 million Americans, including 60,000 Americans who will have access to apprenticeships and on-the-job training thanks to the National Electrical Contractors Association. Thank you, David. Thank you, David."
00:33:08 - 00:33:48 (40 sec),"And one of the countless Americans who has experienced the tremendous benefits of an apprenticeship is Liam Nickelaides -- a proud Air Force veteran, a National Guardsman, and a member of Philadelphia's own Local 98. Liam, please come up. Tell us your great story, please."
00:33:48 - 00:33:52 (4 sec),Yes. How is everybody doing today? [Laughter]
00:33:52 - 00:34:08 (16 sec),"So, as an apprentice, it's a pretty easy schedule. Mondays, you wake up at 4:20 in the morning. Tuesdays, you wake up at the same time, you give a speech in front of a couple thousand people and the President of the United States. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:34:08 - 00:34:08 (0 sec),That's great.
00:34:08 - 00:34:53 (44 sec),"For me, my apprenticeship experience has been a pretty good one. When I went to get a job with Local 98, as a member of the Air Force National Guard, I told them that there'd be a good chance that I'd be deploying pretty often. And I told them that during my interview. And I really thank God for the opportunity that they still gave me to get a job and to train me in their union."
00:34:53 - 00:35:21 (28 sec),"So, I thought that maybe it would be just words that I'd get from Local 98. That, yeah, they support the military, but I didn't really know if I could believe it. But I was able to deploy for three months -- short little deployment. And upon my return, I was able to get pushed right back into the education program with the Local 98. And I'm back working -- upon arrival, back in the United States. And tomorrow, I'm waking up at 4:20, and going back to work again. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:35:21 - 00:35:22 (1 sec),"So, thank you."
00:35:22 - 00:36:11 (49 sec),"Is he a natural? Huh? [Laughter, Applause] Thank you, Liam. Good luck with everything. Wow. That's so great. That's so great. They don't even seem nervous, you know? [Laughter] They come up here -- no notes, no nothing. I think it's great. Thank you very much."
00:36:11 - 00:36:40 (29 sec),"And I want to thank you to everyone here today for your investment in America's future, and for your devotion to the American worker. So important. Hardworking citizens like you who have always been the backbone of our nation will always be the most important factor in our nation. You make it grow, you make it work."
00:36:40 - 00:37:03 (23 sec),"You power our homes, you light up our skylines, and you make the glory of America shine for all the world to see. You take pride in your work, and America takes pride in all of you in this big, beautiful room."
00:37:03 - 00:37:30 (27 sec),"You pour out your hearts to earn a living, you create loving homes for your family, and you teach your children to cherish our values and to cherish our great American flag. Always."
00:37:30 - 00:37:50 (19 sec),"In a house not far from where we are today, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, and forever changed the course of human history. Today, we reaffirm our nation's founding truth: In America, the people govern."
00:37:50 - 00:38:03 (14 sec),"The men and women who go to work each day are not only powering our economy, they are powering our nation and they are powering our freedom."
00:38:03 - 00:38:33 (29 sec),"America will always be a nation of great builders. Because in America, we honor work. We honor grit. We honor craftsmanship. We honor the men and women who turn dreams into reality with their own two, beautiful hands. In America, we honor all of you."
00:38:33 - 00:39:01 (28 sec),"With cable, copper, wire, and steel, you are the ones lighting America's path forward. So important. So important. You may not even understand how important it is, what you do. You are the ones rebuilding this land that we love. You are the ones who are making America greater than ever before."
00:39:01 - 00:39:11 (10 sec),Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
00:00:00 - 00:01:08 (68 sec),"Hello, Iowa. It is great to be back in beautiful Council Bluffs with thousands of hard-working, great, great American patriots. Thank you.  This is truly a historic week for America.  And you know what I'm talking about. Of course, yesterday at the White House, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh."
00:01:08 - 00:01:38 (31 sec),"And today, Justice Kavanaugh took his seat alongside of Justice Gorsuch to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom.  And I want to thank our incredible Republican senators for refusing to back down in the face of the Democrats' shameful campaign of political and personal destruction."
00:01:38 - 00:02:30 (52 sec),"I especially want to thank an Iowa legend, whose backbone and leadership made this great victory possible, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a very tough cookie, Chuck Grassley. Thank you, Chuck.  Thank you. Great man. Great person. From the very first minute Brett Kavanaugh was nominated, radical Democrats were on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy -- they wanted to destroy that man, because they want to destroy me, too, but that's OK.  Me, we understand."
00:02:30 - 00:02:56 (26 sec),"Him, how can you do that? They want to destroy everything. That's all they're good at, resisting. Their whole campaign is to resist. Ours is to create.  What the Democrats did to Brett and his beautiful family is a national embarrassment, a national disgrace. You see what's happening and you see where they're coming from."
00:02:56 - 00:03:26 (30 sec),"You see. Including the phony protestors that got paid...  ... and now they want to protest because they didn't get paid yet, and they want their money.  So now they're going to really protest.  You see, that's a real protest. But in just four weeks, you will have the chance to render your verdict on the Democrats' outrageous conduct."
00:03:26 - 00:03:56 (29 sec),"On November 6th -- and you can do early voting in Iowa. Go. Just vote. Get it over with.  Vote. Go vote. Early voting started today. Right? Today. Early vote. Go do it immediately. Then you don't have to listen to me any more tonight.  In fact, if you did early voting already, go home. Have a good time. Thank you."
00:03:56 - 00:04:47 (51 sec),"We'll let some additional people from outside in, right? Nah, that's not going to happen. Got a lot of people outside. Look at this place. You believe it?  It never changes. Could I ask the cameras to just take a swoop of this room, please? Do you mind? Come on.  They don't like to do that. They don't like to -- they like to keep that camera dead set on me and about six people in the background."
00:04:47 - 00:05:10 (23 sec),"All wearing hats saying ""Make Farmers Great Again.""  And we're doing it. I shouldn't -- we're a little bit early. I shouldn't say it now, but we're going with E15 year round, OK?  I made that promise to you during the campaign. I made that promise to you during the primaries. Remember? I made that promise."
00:05:10 - 00:05:43 (34 sec),"Promises made, promises kept.  Right? On November 6th, you have the chance to stop the radical Democrats by electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate. So, we need the votes.  We have a majority that if one person has a cold, we have to hold the vote. I mean, can you -- we don't have -- it's like we hardly have a majority."
00:05:43 - 00:06:06 (23 sec),"We need votes.  Early voting is now underway. And you know that. You got to get out. Early voting, go out now and vote. Leave here now immediately. Is it still open? Yes, get the hell out of here. Early voting.  And in their lust for power, the Democrats have become totally unhinged. They've gone -- they've gone crazy."
00:06:06 - 00:06:49 (43 sec),"No, they've gone crazy. Now the Democrats -- or as some people would says, the Dims -- the Dims -- who says that? Lou Dobbs, the great Lou Dobbs. He says that, right? Sean Hannity says that. The Dims. Sean Hannity.  Judge Jeanine says that, doesn't she?  Laura -- Laura, how good has Laura been, right?  We got a lot of good people."
00:06:49 - 00:07:21 (32 sec),"Do we like -- do we like Tucker? I like Tucker.  He says that a lot. How about Steve Doocy? How about Ainsley, Brian? We got a lot of great friends.  The Democrats are even talking about doing really bad things now to Justice Kavanaugh. You know what they're talking about? And packing the courts with radical judges to overrule the will of the American people."
00:07:21 - 00:08:00 (39 sec),"It's not going to happen, folks. Not going to happen.  Last week, they're saying we'll impeach him. Impeach him for what? For what?  Besides that, I have to go first, right? Don't I have to go...  Even though we've done nothing wrong, other than create one of the greatest economies in the history of our country...  That will be interesting."
00:08:00 - 00:08:42 (42 sec),"You get impeached for having created the greatest economy in the history of our country. The best job numbers in the history of our country, just about, right? The greatest trade deals, which we've just finished, in the history of our country.  The biggest regulatory cuts by far already in less than two years, bigger than any other president during their entire term or terms...  The biggest tax cuts and reforms -- you got a lot of money back -- in the history of our country."
00:08:42 - 00:09:15 (33 sec),"But the Democrats have become too extreme. And they've become, frankly, too dangerous to govern. They've gone wacko.  They've gone so far left that they consider Pocahontas to be a rational person. No, it's crazy. Elizabeth Warren.  Oh, I hope she runs. I hope she runs. Then we can finally get down to the fact as to whether or not she has Indian blood."
00:09:15 - 00:09:41 (27 sec),"So far, she's not doing too well. Her mother says she has high cheekbones. That's why.  And she's gotten a lot of advantages by falsely claiming what she's claiming. So I hope she's one of the finalists. But I don't want to knock too many of them, because maybe by doing I'll knock them all out early and I'll actually end up somebody that's -- like, that's got some talent."
00:09:41 - 00:10:12 (31 sec),"That wouldn't be good. So we have to be nice and quiet.  I should be really quiet, really, really, quite on the bad ones. On the bad ones.  Like, we won't talk about Cory Booker, who ran Newark into the ground.  We won't talk about Da Nang Dick...  ... who tried to convince people for 15 years that he was a great war hero."
00:10:12 - 00:10:33 (21 sec),"They were going down left. They were going down right.  Right, you know who that is? Blumenthal. He said they were going on my left, they were going down -- he was in Da Nang Province. Except the one problem. It's hard to be there, because he was never in Vietnam, but these are minor details.  And then he gets up. He goes, I demand total honesty and transparency."
00:10:33 - 00:10:50 (18 sec),"I'm saying, what's -- he wants honesty. Great war hero. He's a great hero.  Yeah. Right, how about -- how about Senator Feinstein? That's another beauty.  That's a beauty. Did you leak the documents? Well, what, what? No, I didn't do it. Did we leak? Did we leak?  No. No. No, we didn't -- did you ever see -- no, she goes no. He just said, no, we didn't leak."
00:10:50 - 00:11:52 (62 sec),"[Audience chants Lock her up]  And I think they're talking about Feinstein. Can you believe that? Now, was that the worst body language, honestly? In other words, did she leak it? A hundred percent.  No, no, I don't want to get sued. Ninety-nine percent. See, now I can't get sued. Now I can't get sued.  You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob."
00:11:52 - 00:12:26 (33 sec),"And that's what the Democrats are becoming.  They would turn our country so fast into Venezuelan -- and Venezuelan is not doing too well, folks. If you want to drain the swamp, you must defeat the Democrats, so you're going to have one hell of a swamp.  Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving."
00:12:26 - 00:12:52 (26 sec),"And America is winning again like never before, because we are finally putting America first.  The national unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent. You believe that one?  3.7 percent, the lowest in 50 years, five-oh, 50. And it's going better. It's going better. Iowa's unemployment rate is 2.5 percent, among the lowest in its history that we can find."
00:12:52 - 00:13:01 (9 sec),"And by the way, we need people helping you. We need people coming in. We need people to run the farms. We're going to have people coming in. But they're going to come in legally, and they're going to come in through merit, through merit. It's called the merit system. [Audience chants Build the wall]  And we've built the wall -- we're building the wall."
00:13:01 - 00:13:51 (50 sec),"We've started. A lot of it's getting done right now. We got $1.6 billion. Another $1.6 billion. And another $1.6 billion. I want 'em to give us the money so I can build it -- we can build it in a year. But we've done a lot of it. It's going up right now.  But, you know, the Democrats feel that that's one thing we really want, we got our money for the military, $700 billion."
00:13:51 - 00:14:11 (20 sec),"We got our money to help us out with the opioid crisis, $6 billion.  But when it comes to the wall, they feel we want it so badly, but we keep getting big chunks and we keep building that wall. And it's under construction. And we're going to get it finished sooner than anyone would believe. And if you could get me some Republicans, we'll get it done quickly."
00:14:11 - 00:14:34 (24 sec),"Quickly.  I mean, when I have to ask Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters...  ... Maxine Waters, can we build a wall, Maxine? No, I don't want that wall built. She doesn't want a wall built. Can we build it? How about -- how about Pelosi? We want to build a wall. No, I don't want that wall built.  Look, Iowa manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest rate in more than 20 years."
00:14:34 - 00:15:09 (35 sec),"And if you remember...  ... the last administration, without mentioning names, the last administration said manufacturing jobs, they're dead. They're gone. We have 600,000 have come back since the election.  Six hundred thousand. More Americans are now working than ever before. Think of that. At this point today, this day, we have more Americans by far working -- right now working than have ever worked in our country before."
00:15:09 - 00:15:33 (24 sec),"Isn't that great? That's a big number. That's a big number.  Today I kept another major promise, as I said, to the people of Iowa and Nebraska and other countries.  Wait. Hey, wait a minute. I got to do that again. I got to do that again. I love Nebraska. You know we won Iowa, we won Nebraska...  But they said, sir, you're speaking in Iowa, but we'll have some people from Nebraska there."
00:15:33 - 00:15:56 (23 sec),"What the...  Like I said, Nebraska...  OK, so -- and we have both. By the way, we have both great governors here.  And I did that just in case. So, ready? I'm going to go Iowa first, then I'm going to go Nebraska. I just want to see who the hell I'm speaking to.  OK? Because that was a little shocking what I just heard."
00:15:56 - 00:17:09 (73 sec),"So I'm going to go -- I'm just curious, OK? Iowa.  Nebraska.  Unbelievable. So they said, sir, you're speaking in Iowa, there may be a few people coming in from Nebraska. I don't think that's right. Great going, fellas. Great going. I'll tell my staff, great going, fellas.  Doesn't matter. We love both. Who cares, right?"
00:17:09 - 00:17:31 (23 sec),"Who cares? We love 'em.  All I know is you've got a lot of farmers in both, right?  And my administration is protecting ethanol, all right? That's what you want to hear.  Today, we are unleashing the power of E15 to fuel our country all year long. Not eight months. All year long.  The Dems will end ethanol."
00:17:31 - 00:18:33 (61 sec),"You know that. They're not going to approve ethanol. They will take it away as -- we'll try and make it, like, so they can't do it to -- but they will find a way to take it away if you give them rights. You better get out there and vote for Republicans.  We've also achieved another historic victory for Iowa farmers and ranchers, by replacing the job-killing NAFTA with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA."
00:18:33 - 00:19:15 (42 sec),"But if Democrats take control, they will try to reverse our amazing progress and plunge our country into gridlock, frankly, into poverty, ultimately into chaos. That's what's going to happen.  And we've never had it like it's been now. We've never had it like it is now. Look at all the money you people are making."
00:19:15 - 00:19:45 (30 sec),"What are you going to do with it?  Democrats want to raise your taxes, impose socialism, dismantle law enforcement...  ... eliminate ICE...  ... and get rid of American borders. You want to get rid of the borders, right? You won't have a country.  And I've been saying this, and I mean it. Democrats are the party of crime."
00:19:45 - 00:19:59 (14 sec),"They are. Republicans are the party of safety. We are also the party of jobs, jobs, jobs.  Now, we're thrilled to be joined tonight by a number of terrific Republican leaders. Iowa Congressman Steve King...  Where's Steve? Where is he? Where is Steve? Where is he? I wish he could get a little bit more conservative."
00:19:59 - 00:20:22 (23 sec),"Can you believe this guy? He may be -- we're all -- he may be the world's most conservative human being.  Thank you, Steve.  And I supported him long before I became a politician. Do I have to use that term? Am I a politician?  Thank you, Steve. And another great, great gentleman, so much help to me, Congressman Jeff Fortenberry."
00:20:22 - 00:20:51 (29 sec),"Thanks, Jeff. Great job. Thank you. They're always with us. They are -- those two, always with us.  Another friend of mine, got to know him during the primaries, got to know him during the election. We took this state by storm. He helped. But I did even better than him. You know, you still need a -- you still need a product, right?"
00:20:51 - 00:21:18 (27 sec),"But we did great. And we love the people of Iowa. We took Nebraska equally.  By a lot. By a lot. That wasn't close. Iowa GOP Chair -- friend of mine -- Jeff Kaufmann. Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. Great job, Jeff. Get ready, Jeff. We're coming back soon, Jeff. And from Nebraska...  ... where's Tom Osborne, huh?"
00:21:18 - 00:22:04 (46 sec),"Where is he? Where's Tom Osborne?  And I don't know Tom Osborne. All I know -- it's ""Tom Osborne,"" right? All I know is for years all he knew how to do is win, win, just win.  I mean, how good a coach was that guy? You know, there's a guy -- again, I don't know him, never met him. But it's called no talk, all action."
00:22:04 - 00:22:27 (24 sec),"Isn't that nice?  Now, what you did every year, you won. Better get going, Nebraska.  But we have a governor who's done a fantastic job. He's so into so many different things, including cutting your taxes, and we have him with us, Governor Pete Ricketts. Pete?  Great guy. Great. I think they like you, Pete."
00:22:27 - 00:22:43 (16 sec),"Vote for Ricketts. That's November. Right? Vote for Ricketts. He's got an opponent that doesn't have what you need, but still you never know. You got to get out there and vote, right, Pete? You have a vote. Great job, Pete.  And Congressman Don Bacon...  Incredible guy. Great job, Don. He's always there."
00:22:43 - 00:23:07 (24 sec),"He's always there, Don Bacon. He's always there. Thank you, Don. Great job. Appreciate it. Every time we needed him, he's there. Thank you.  And Nebraska GOP Chair Dan Welch. Thank you, Dan. Thanks, Dan. What a great group. And I am especially thrilled to introduce a person just to come up for a second to say a couple of words, because she has become a real star in the Republican Party and in politics."
00:23:07 - 00:23:37 (30 sec),"Kim Reynolds, she fights every day for the people of Iowa. And she always delivers and -- wow, does she have my endorsement. She's incredible. Kim, please come up. Kim Reynolds.  Kim Reynolds."
00:23:37 - 00:24:15 (37 sec),"Thank you so much. Oh, my gosh! This is amazing! Thank you all for being here! This is incredible! Welcome back, Mr. President, to the great state of Iowa. And on behalf of all Iowans, I want to say thank you, thank you for cutting taxes for hard-working Iowans, for eliminating senseless regulations that stifled innovation and jobs, for standing strong with Justice Kavanaugh and appointing conservative judges to the court!"
00:24:15 - 00:24:50 (35 sec),"Thank you. Thank you for USMCA and for KORUS. And, Mr. President, thank you for year-round E15! Our farmers thank you. Iowans thank you. And we are grateful. Promises made, promises kept. The Midwest has a partner in the White House with President Donald Trump. Woo! It is an incredible honor to serve as the 43rd governor of this great state."
00:24:50 - 00:25:14 (24 sec),"And my story is the Iowa story. It's a reflection of the opportunities that exist here, where a small-town girl, daughter of a factory worker and farmer, who waited tables, checked groceries, never gave up on her dream of getting a college degree, is standing before you today as the first female governor of the state of Iowa."
00:25:14 - 00:25:37 (22 sec),"I understand the challenges that everyday Iowans have faced because I've faced them myself. And that's why I'm proud that we focused on cutting taxes, expanding and growing jobs and wages and opportunities, addressing Iowa's health care needs and creating strong and safe communities. Iowa is working. The Midwest is working."
00:25:37 - 00:26:24 (48 sec),"And we're getting things done. We're recognized as the number-one state in the country, second lowest unemployment, third best managed, wages are going up, taxes are going down. Our budget is balanced. And we're going to keep Iowa moving. We need your help. We need -- Republicans need your help. We need your support."
00:26:24 - 00:26:56 (31 sec),"And to do that, we have to show up. We have to go vote. And if you do that, I promise you, Republicans up and down this ticket are going to be a partner for our great president, to keep the Midwest and moving forward and to keep the United States of America number one! God bless you! God bless the great state of Iowa and the United States of America!"
00:26:56 - 00:27:18 (22 sec),"Wow. Good energy. That's what you need, good energy. Thank you, Kim. Great. By the way, Kim's opponent this November is a radical Dem named Fred Hubbell. He's got some problems. He's weak on crime, weak on borders, doesn't want any. Only wants to massively raise your taxes. He wants to take away your ethanol."
00:27:18 - 00:27:46 (28 sec),"What I'm giving you, he will take, very quickly. Wants to devastate your farms and businesses with an avalanche of job-killing regulations that we just got rid of. Everybody get out and vote for Governor Reynolds on Election Day. Finally, I want to introduce another great Iowa Republican, Congressman David Young."
00:27:46 - 00:28:15 (29 sec),"When you said, David -- he's a great guy -- he's another one, fellas, he's with us, he's with us all the way -- when you said, David, to Congress you voted to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, tax care of our veterans -- our veterans, we love 'em. Veterans' choice. We got veterans' choice. After 44 years, we got veterans' choice."
00:28:15 - 00:28:33 (18 sec),"He voted -- thank you very much. He voted to secure our borders, stop the visa lottery horror show. Can you imagine it? This is legislation. They put names in a bin. We picked names. Do you think we're -- they're putting their finest? We get these people -- a lottery, can you believe? We want a merit system."
00:28:33 - 00:29:03 (31 sec),"We don't want a lottery system. We want a merit system. And we're going to get it. And we're on our way to getting it. Need a few more votes. We got to get some Republicans. And he voted -- and he -- believe this is somebody -- he's not into the American military, but we are. We are really into the American rebuilt military."
00:29:03 - 00:29:40 (37 sec),"But David is a true champion of the military. He loves our military. He loves our vets. David, get on up here, David. Come up. Come here. Remember this. A vote for David is a vote for me and our agenda to make America great again. David, come up."
00:29:40 - 00:30:06 (25 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Wow. This is incredible. Thank you for showing up tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. It's such a pleasure to have you in Iowa. For years, presidents have made promises about E15 year round. We've got a president who delivered, and he did it. Thank you for keeping your promise, Mr. President."
00:30:06 - 00:30:45 (39 sec),"Yeah! Look at the economy, 4.2 percent growth, 3.7 percent unemployment rate across the country, 2.5 percent unemployment rate here. Incredible things are happening, folks. Allowing hard-working Iowans to keep their hard-earned dollars. Opportunity, the American dream. Thank you, Mr. President. Rebuilding our military and signing into law the largest pay increase for our military in almost 10 years."
00:30:45 - 00:31:26 (41 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Securing our border, Mr. President. Thank you. And thank you for getting us out of that bogus Iran deal. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Mr. President, for finally moving our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in Israel. And, Mr. President, you are looking out for veterans."
00:31:26 - 00:32:26 (60 sec),"Thank you for that. Hey, folks. Elections are about choices, right? We can keep moving forward, or we can allow Nancy Pelosi and her hand... and her hand-picked candidates to take us backwards. We cannot go backwards to higher taxes, more government, a weaker military, and the failed policies of the past."
00:32:26 - 00:32:47 (21 sec),"I need your support. We need your support. Talk to your friends. November 6th. Vote. Go to davidyoungforiowa.com to volunteer. Thank you, Mr. President. God bless you. God bless this great country. God bless Iowa. God bless you."
00:32:47 - 00:33:13 (26 sec),"Thank you, David. A vote for David's far-left opponent, Cindy ""Tax Me""... Remember that name, Cindy ""Tax Me"". It's a very good name, actually, for her. I guess it's actually Axne. But we call her ""Tax Ne"". That was so easy. I didn't hear that one, but I don't know if anyone's thought of it, but that's like a natural."
00:33:13 - 00:33:51 (38 sec),"Is a vote for the radical agenda of Pelosi and Schumer and, of course, Maxine Waters. ""Tax Me"" opposed our massive tax cuts. That's why her name. She was born with the right name. And she wants a socialist takeover of health care, which is going to destroy our entire city. Cindy Axne is totally controlled by Pelosi and the extreme Washington liberals who are bankrolling her campaign, totally bankrolling her campaign."
00:33:51 - 00:34:14 (23 sec),"If you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming -- can you believe this -- the speaker of the House? Then you need to vote for David Young, who is a terrific, terrific guy. Terrific guy. And you also need to vote for a great friend of mine, who really through just force of will got us to put up millions of dollars to build a dam to stop your flooding in a very important part of Iowa, Congressman Rod Blum."
00:34:14 - 00:34:58 (44 sec),"Great guy. And I have to say, Rod is fighting to reform welfare, reduce crime, and continuously cut your taxes. Rod's opponent, Abby Finkenauer -- who the hell is that? Who is that? Is an extreme liberal who supports mass amnesty. Anybody like amnesty? For illegal aliens, wants to raise your taxes through the roof, and wants to take away your health care."
00:34:58 - 00:35:32 (34 sec),"So you got to vote for Rod Blum. Got to vote for David Young. You've got to vote for these two characters over here who have been there. We don't even bring them up, because they're leading by so much, I said, I'm not going to waste your time. But get out and vote anyway, just in case, right? Just in -- you never know."
00:35:32 - 00:35:57 (25 sec),You never know. A majority of House Democrats have already signed up for a socialist health care plan that would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for 20 million seniors. Republicans want to protect Medicare. We're protecting it for our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it all of their lives.
00:35:57 - 00:36:26 (28 sec),"Right? And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We are going to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. The Democrat agenda is radical socialism and open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. What a great idea. You know why? Because the people that work for ICE, they love our country."
00:36:26 - 00:37:06 (41 sec),"But they're very tough people. Guess what? That's what we need to take care of MS-13, all the gangs. You don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. Even you don't want to do it. I don't want to do it, either. They're fantastic people. They love our country. And to them, it's a day in the office. For other people, they want no part of it. They want to turn America, these Democrats -- and that's what they want -- into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and the MS-13 killers... that we're getting out of the country, by the way, by the thousands."
00:37:06 - 00:37:44 (38 sec),"Thousands. They've taken over towns in Long Island. I mean, literally. It could happen to your community. They've taken over towns in Long Island. And we go in, and we, like, liberate the towns. Can you believe -- towns that I grew up right next to. I know every one of them. And they go in and they go in and they have no fear and they take care of the situation, they get them the hell out of there or they put them in jail."
00:37:44 - 00:38:01 (17 sec),"They either send them back where they came from or they put them in jail. And they liberate -- literally, can you imagine we're saying this about places in our country? They liberate towns and small cities in different places of Long Island and others. They liberate them, like we're taking over a war and we get liberated."
00:38:01 - 00:38:31 (29 sec),"How sad. How pathetic. And if we didn't have ICE, it wouldn't happen. It wouldn't happen. So we have to cherish our law enforcement. We have to protect our law enforcement. The Democrat immigration policies aren't just wrong, they're lethal. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens that sneak into our country."
00:38:31 - 00:39:13 (42 sec),"And Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE and Border Patrol and our great law enforcement, including your great local law enforcement. If you want to have safe communities, if you want to have a border, then you must organize. Remember this. You don't have a border, you don't have a country, folks, OK, let's face it. Let's face it. You know, we're doing things that are incredible outside, but things are happening you won't even -- you'll see."
00:39:13 - 00:39:45 (32 sec),"You'll see what happens. You take a look at what's going on with North Korea. They were ready to go to war with North Korea. Now we're getting along very nicely. It's working out very well. Look at Iran. Before I got there, Iran was going to take over the Middle East in like 12 minutes, right? Now they're trying to survive."
00:39:45 - 00:40:09 (24 sec),"You got riots in every city. So if you want to really just keep up what we're doing and keep this country -- we have tremendous potential. You know, we're doing well. But we have tremendous potential to grow incredibly. When we get rid of these horrible, disgusting trade deals, with China, over the last five, six years, we've been losing $300 billion to $500 billion a year, billion."
00:40:09 - 00:40:34 (25 sec),"Nobody even knows what the hell it is, it's so much. It's ending. It's ending. It's ending. And it's not just China. It's not just China. And what we do is we protect wealthy countries for nothing. For nothing. Would you say Saudi Arabia is wealthy? Yeah. Right? And I said to the king, you've got to pay."
00:40:34 - 00:41:07 (32 sec),"I'm sorry. You've got to pay. We're going to protect, you've got to pay. Get the money. You've got to pay. You've got to pay! I have friends in the audience, they're good businessmen. They're looking like, absolutely. They -- but you're not a politician. A politician doesn't -- you got to pay. Japan is an immensely wealthy country."
00:41:07 - 00:41:37 (30 sec),"Great people. Prime Minister Abe just had a big election, won by a landslide. He's a friend of mine. But I said, look, we're protecting Japan. They're making a fortune. They're sending us millions of cars. We're not allowed to send them -- they have barriers. We can't send them cars. But they send millions of cars into here."
00:41:37 - 00:42:18 (41 sec),"They pay essentially no tax. And we subsidize their military. When I say subsidize, I'm not talking about like for 2 percent. We pay for 70 percent of their military. Nobody knows this! And I said to the prime minister, who's a great guy, I said, how come? And he honestly says, nobody ever asked. When we straighten out this, we have so much potential."
00:42:18 - 00:42:40 (22 sec),"And there are many countries like that. I'm not looking at just those two. There are many, many countries like that. And you know what? We should protect people that can't protect themselves and they're getting slaughtered. It's OK. It's OK. That's OK. And we're now building by far the strongest military that we've ever had."
00:42:40 - 00:43:17 (38 sec),"And the reason is... And the reason is that when you have the strongest military ever in the history of this world, nobody's going to mess with you. These big guys know it over here. These people know it. I don't want to use our military. But this is a very dangerous world. This is a sick world, in many ways, OK? It's a very, very -- I mean, I see things as president that you don't want to know about."
00:43:17 - 00:43:39 (22 sec),"The things that I see, you don't want to know about. We have to be on guard for some really treacherous people that are running some places -- and we are so prepared you have no idea. We are so prepared. We are so prepared. Because this election is about security. And it's also about prosperity. Since the election... [Audience member calls out Seal Team Six] SEAL Team is right."
00:43:39 - 00:44:08 (29 sec),"Who's SEAL team? The good-looking guy over there, that's good. SEAL Team, they're great. But since the election, we've created -- nobody believes this. If I would have said this when I came to Iowa many times or when I came to Nebraska many times... With your governor, with your governor, if I would have said that we would create 4.2 million new jobs, the fake news media -- look at this, it's like the Academy Awards back there... Look."
00:44:08 - 00:44:32 (24 sec),"The fake news would have said, oh, what he's saying, oh, it's -- oh -- well, guess what? We created 4.2 million jobs just since the election. And... We lifted over 4 million people off of food stamps. How good is that? We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:44:32 - 00:45:07 (35 sec),"And African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. And Kanye West, who gets it... And Big Jim Brown, how do you think he'd do in the NFL today? Bum, the greatest. But they're coming over to the White House very shortly. We're going to have a little lunch and talk about it. But they get it! How do you -- how do you win when you hear those numbers?"
00:45:07 - 00:45:37 (30 sec),"Because the Democrats for 100 years have been promising African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asians. They've been promising everything, nothing happens. Here we are, less than two years, the best employment numbers, the best numbers they've ever had in virtually every category. Every category. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment rates have also reached all-time lows."
00:45:37 - 00:46:05 (28 sec),"How do you -- how do you beat us in 2020? Governor, do you have any idea? What would you say? What would you say? We're going to do a great job. But, yeah, but we have the best numbers ever recorded. Those debates I look forward to. See, I said we were going to do that. Remember? What the hell do you have to lose?"
00:46:05 - 00:46:36 (32 sec),Remember that? Right? I said we were going to do it. But now we've done it. So how's somebody going to do better? But we're going to do much better than even that. Women's unemployment rate just fell to 3.6 percent. Which is the lowest in more than 65 years. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning.
00:46:36 - 00:47:28 (51 sec),"We have finalized a new fair trade deal for South Korea. They don't even talk about -- that's a big deal. We just did a deal, manufacturers, farmers. The deal was so bad. That was a Hillary Clinton deal. She said -- no, no. She was secretary of state. [Audience chants Lock her up] She made a statement today, they're doing a tour, her and her husband or something."
00:47:28 - 00:47:51 (23 sec),"And she made a statement, some ridiculous -- I said, well, that's why she lost the election. She just doesn't get it. She's never gotten it. But she never got it -- so she said, we will create 250,000 jobs. And everybody was excited. Unfortunately, she was right, but it was created in South Korea, not in our country."
00:47:51 - 00:48:35 (44 sec),"Just another deal, check it off. Just another horrible deal. We will create 250,000 for -- you know if she said for South Korea, at least it would have been honest, right? But we've totally renegotiated that. Under the guise of massive tariffs -- I said, if you're not going to do it, we're just going to put tariffs in, that's it. And they said, let's do it. Come on. Let's do it. Let's make a decent deal."
00:48:35 - 00:49:13 (38 sec),"And we've opened it up for your farmers, for your manufacturers. We've taken a horrible deal and made it a good deal. Made it a good deal. And now we're opening up or we're going to do something where we do even better, but we're going to open up Japan for trade and the European Union, which is brutal. They are brutal."
00:49:13 - 00:50:08 (55 sec),"Sounds so nice. So nice. The European Union. Sounds so nice, right? They are brutal. But that's because they've had their way. They formed in order to take advantage of us on trade. Now, we protect most of those countries. European Union, NATO. We protect most. So Germany is paying 1 percent. We are paying 4.3 percent to protect Europe."
00:50:08 - 00:50:32 (24 sec),"Explain that one to me, OK, please? The numbers are horrific. But I've gotten $44 billion last year, more paid into NATO by other countries. And this year will be more than that. That's why I say, our country has such incredible potential. There's so many -- I mean, I could go through deal -- I could go through so many things, just the same thing."
00:50:32 - 00:51:08 (36 sec),"They were going to build the embassy in Israel. As you know, we got approved, right? On my desk was a document to get ready to spend over $1 billion to build a building. I said, how do you spend $1 billion to build a building? I didn't look, but probably like one story, it's an embassy, right, two stories, a billion dollars."
00:51:08 - 00:52:00 (52 sec),"And I said, maybe we can get a building and renovate it and fix it up real fast, and who knows? And our great -- our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, called. He said, you know, we have the best site in Jerusalem. And there's a beautiful building on it. And we can take just a big corner of that building, fix it up, and instead of waiting 20 or 25 years, by the time this thing got worked out, we could have it in about four months, sir."
00:52:00 - 00:52:29 (29 sec),"I said, what do you mean the site's the best? He said, well, we were there early. We've had the site for many years. The building is good, but, you know, we have to renovate. So we're going to spend a billion and probably never get it open, right? And, by the way, had we spent a billion, it would end up costing $3 billion or $4 billion for -- you know, people would look at it, probably one-third the size of this room."
00:52:29 - 00:53:03 (34 sec),"They'll spend $2 billion. So I said, David, how much is it going to cost to do that? And how good is the site? Site's great. And, sir, the building is set way back, which is good for purposes of security. They like that. They don't want it right on the sidewalk. I can't imagine why. Set way back. He said, sir, it's beautiful."
00:53:03 - 00:53:42 (39 sec),"And it's a big site. We can do other things later. I said, how much is it going to cost? He said, sir, it's going to cost about $180,000. I told him, we'll think about it. True, $180,000. First time in my life I've ever done this. First time. Don't get angry at me. I said, David, it's too cheap. It doesn't sound good."
00:53:42 - 00:54:03 (21 sec),"I never did that before. I never did it before. Like, I like to say, like Air Force One, we gave out the contract. They were going to give it out for $1.6 billion more than I gave it out for. They'll tell you. I said to Boeing, I'm not going to pay that price. And I said, I'm not paying it. Cancel the contract."
00:54:03 - 00:54:33 (29 sec),"I'm not paying it. And I held a line. I said, you got to take off $1.8 billion. They called back a day later. Supposing we took off $1.6 billion? I said you have a deal, OK. I actually did that. I actually said cut it in half, OK? But we don't have to go through the whole deal. But with the -- with the -- with the embassy, I said, David, David, $180,000, it's too cheap."
00:54:33 - 00:54:55 (22 sec),"We've got to spend more than that. It doesn't sound good. But, sir, I can do a really -- I said, I know you can, but it's not going to play well. You mean we took it from $1 billion to $180,000? I said, David, I said, you know what, David, make it $400,000. And use Jerusalem stone. Did anybody ever see it? It's the most beautiful stone."
00:54:55 - 00:55:13 (18 sec),"And you're in Jerusalem, right? I mean, what's -- probably inexpensive. Most expensive stone when you bring it here. But you're in Jerusalem. They should have plenty of it, right? I said, David, use beautiful Jerusalem stone and let's do it. We opened it up four months later for $400,000. Can you believe it? Open."
00:55:13 - 00:55:41 (28 sec),"It's open. I could tell you many of these stories. I could tell you many. I could tell you so many of these stories. There's that story, and I got 30 more we could take about. The way we spend -- he says I want to hear more. Should I give you one more of those stories? All right. All right, one story. So we like South Korea."
00:55:41 - 00:56:21 (40 sec),"We've got 32,000 soldiers over there. Thank you very much, United States. They don't pay. They don't pay us, but that's OK. They're very successful. And the Obama administration gave this incredible -- it's all right. Don't worry. It's being mostly dismantled. Mostly dismantled. So my first week in office, I get there, and I notice there's this incredible THAAD system, THAAD system to knock down rockets."
00:56:21 - 00:56:49 (28 sec),"Shoots down rockets, shoots down missiles, most incredible thing you've ever seen. I think they got like a 97 percent shot at it. And the company likes to say, but if you send up two missiles, you get it 100 percent. But that's expensive. I said, do it with one, right? So I get there, and brand new, they put in. I said, just out of curiosity, who pays for it? I said to a certain general, good guy, but, you know, he's not into business."
00:56:49 - 00:57:11 (21 sec),"He's into winning wars, but they're not into business. They don't care. OK. He's into winning, but not into business. He's got a little business, too. So I said, so, let me ask you something. How much does that system cost? Sir, I don't know. As a businessman, you, by the way, a good businessman, you know what I'm talking about."
00:57:11 - 00:57:29 (18 sec),"How much does that cost? Sir, I don't know. Who pays for it? Sir, I don't know. Now, you got to understand, the purpose of this -- it's on the border. This is in the time when we were having a little problem, you know, at the beginning. A lot of people thought we were going to war, but we're doing nicely now."
00:57:29 - 00:57:51 (22 sec),"But I said, so let me get this -- we have a system that's very expensive. And we shoot down rockets that are shot from North Korea to South Korea to shoot down -- OK, so we're protecting South Korea, right? Why aren't they paying? Well, I don't know. I don't -- I said, General, immediately go and find out who's paying for it and how much."
00:57:51 - 00:58:39 (48 sec),"So he goes, next morning, he comes into my office. Sir, we are an ally of South Korea. And therefore, we are paying for the system, sir. I said, I thought so. Then I said, all right, give me the bad news. Raytheon. Give me the bad news. How much is it going to cost? Sir, $1 billion. I said, whoa, whoa! So we're putting in a system that we pay for and it's going to cost $1 billion in order to protect an immensely wealthy country that makes all of your television sets, right?"
00:58:39 - 00:59:22 (42 sec),"Samsung, LG, I order a lot of them, South Korea. And I'm trying to figure that out, Steve King, as a true conservative, but I'm trying to figure it out. So we do this, and I said, do me a favor. Go back to the country. Renegotiate that deal. That's not a good deal. But, sir, the Obama administration has already agreed to it. I said I don't care if they agreed to it. I couldn't care less if they agreed to it. I don't care."
00:59:22 - 00:59:57 (35 sec),"So that's the second or third story. I could go on all night, but I want to get the hell out of here, OK? Because I thought I was coming to Iowa, and there's more people from Nebraska. Right, Pete Ricketts? Pete Ricketts. Governor Ricketts. We love you both. We love you both. After years of rebuilding other nations, I could give you 30 stories."
00:59:57 - 01:00:26 (29 sec),"I -- I could give you 100 stories like that -- we're finally rebuilding our nation. That's what we're doing. America is not being taken advantage of anymore. America is being respected again. With Republicans in Congress, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. Big numbers."
01:00:26 - 01:01:02 (36 sec),"So important for the farmers and small business. To save your family farms and ranches, we've virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. So now if you like your children or love your children, you can leave your beautiful farm to your children and they won't have to pay any taxes. They won't have to go to your local banker, borrow money, and end up losing the farm, which was happening."
01:01:02 - 01:01:22 (20 sec),"Now you won't have any -- you guys know that, that's a big deal -- that's a big deal, Jeff and Steve and everybody. That's a big deal, because people were leaving their farms, they go out, they mortgage their farms, then they end up -- the kids end up going through hell and losing their farms. So now you won't have to go to the bank, borrow money, put a mortgage on. But here's the thing."
01:01:22 - 01:01:46 (24 sec),"If you don't like your kids, or if you don't love your kids, it doesn't have any impact on you. Sell the farm. Enjoy yourselves and relax. Don't give them anything. Don't give them anything if you don't like them. Don't give them anything! We're reducing the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients access life-saving treatment we passed."
01:01:46 - 01:02:10 (24 sec),"And right to try. Right to try. We all know what it is. We have right to try now. For years, people wanted to access some of these cures that worked, but they can't get approved, because it's a long process which we've cut way down. Right to try. They were terminally ill and they couldn't get treatment of something that may work."
01:02:10 - 01:02:33 (23 sec),"We just signed right to try. And these guys helped a lot, right? Steve, Jeff, everybody. They helped a lot. David was great, David Young. So now you get the right to try. People used to travel all over the world if they had money. If they didn't have money, they'd go home. They had no hope. Now they can get treatment."
01:02:33 - 01:03:05 (32 sec),"They sign a document, they can get treatment. They tried for 40 years to get that passed. We got it passed. Right to try. I love it. We also passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. Big thing. Forty-four years. Forty-four years, they've tried to get it passed. People are waiting on line for 12 days, for 20 days, for 28 days."
01:03:05 - 01:03:32 (27 sec),"People aren't that sick. By the time they see the doctor, seriously, they're terminally ill. They couldn't see a doctor. Now we have the right to let them go see a private doctor. We pay for the bills. It's great for them. It actually is saving for us. Forty-four years. Forty-four years. Forty-four years."
01:03:32 - 01:03:53 (20 sec),"I thought it was my idea, but then I came back and I said -- what a great idea. They said, we've been trying to get it passed for 44 years. I mean, how simple? Right? Forty-four years. But because of guys like this, right, Steve, Jeff, everybody, Governor, you were incredible, Pete Ricketts. You helped so much."
01:03:53 - 01:04:19 (27 sec),"All of you guys. And the landmark V.A. accountability law. You couldn't fire anybody. There were -- literally, there were sadists working for the V.A. There were bad people. There were thieves. Horrible people. You couldn't fire them. We passed -- I think it's 46, 47 years. Look, I hate to say it. Union problems."
01:04:19 - 01:04:38 (19 sec),"All sorts of problems. Civil service problems. Pretty strong lobby, right? We got it passed, 44, 46 years. And now when we catch people that aren't taking care of our veterans, we look at them, we say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here! It's true. It's true. [Audience chants Trump] Now, you know, they don't spin the cameras."
01:04:38 - 01:05:09 (30 sec),"Tell this -- I said in the beginning to spin. Nobody does it. Because they don't want to show how big these crowds are. They -- no, I'm telling you. They don't want to show it. They don't want to show it. Look, they're not spinning. Do you see one camera turning? No, they don't want to show all these people."
01:05:09 - 01:05:49 (40 sec),"They don't want to show it. I don't see -- look, I don't see one camera turning. They don't want to show them. Our great first lady -- I come home, I said, did they show the crowd? No, but it sounded massive. Right? It sounded -- sounded -- looks like an Iowa -- Iowa state or Nebraska football game. That's what it sounds like."
01:05:49 - 01:06:16 (28 sec),"That's what it sounds like. Right? That's what it sounds like. So my wife would say, they didn't show the crowd, but it sure as hell sounded big. You know, when you have crowds like this, you can't cheat on the sound. I mean, it's a lot of people. But they cheat, because they -- they never show the crowd."
01:06:16 - 01:06:51 (35 sec),"We secured... $716 billion to fully rebuild our great American military. And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Air Force, the Space Force. Very important. Very important. We got to get that done, Congressman. Everybody wants that. So important. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
01:06:51 - 01:07:18 (27 sec),"They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Iowa and Nebraska. And we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. [Audience chants USA] And, by the way, speaking of the NFL... No, it's OK. But you know, for years, the NFL had a big problem with Canada and the Super Bowl and rights."
01:07:18 - 01:08:13 (55 sec),"It's a complicated thing, but it doesn't matter. And I heard about the problem. And we were dealing with them on a much, much, much bigger issue. And the NFL is a great American company. And I told my people, give the damn NFL problem solved. It took them about two minutes. And I got a call from the commissioner."
01:08:13 - 01:08:36 (23 sec),"I thought he was calling about the flag. I thought he was calling to say we have fully agreed that we are all going to stand at attention with our hand on our heart, helmet on the ground, and salute -- he didn't. But a good guy. He called me to thank me. You know why I did that? I did that -- nobody told me to do it. I did that because I knew they had a problem."
01:08:36 - 01:08:53 (17 sec),"And it's a great American company. Whether we like it, don't like it, doesn't matter. It's a great American company. And so I got it done. I got it done. Took us like two minutes. And you know what? Now the players will be paid more money and they'll still hate me. Isn't that terrible? They'll still hate Trump."
01:08:53 - 01:09:24 (31 sec),"And they get more money. But that's OK. That's why -- that's why guys like Jim Brown and Kanye and so many others like me. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote or early voting. Get out and vote or early voting."
01:09:24 - 01:09:56 (32 sec),"Vote for Governor Kim Reynolds. Vote -- I thought you were coming here as my guest. Pete, I thought you were coming here -- just today -- come on over, Pete. Vote for Pete Ricketts. I didn't know you were bringing half of Nebraska, Pete. Vote for Congressman Rod Blum and Congressman David Young. Don't bother with these two guys."
01:09:56 - 01:10:31 (35 sec),"They're going to win by -- vote for them, too, please. Vote for them, too. That's right, Steve. They're going to vote for you guys. Thank you. And thank you. Vote for Republicans. You're doing the right thing, because a vote for us is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products that are made right here in the USA."
01:10:31 - 01:11:07 (36 sec),"That's what we're doing. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division, and destruction. And you know what else? You know what else? And weakness, because it's weakness."
01:11:07 - 01:11:32 (25 sec),"And to reclaim our magnificent destiny as Americans. To everyone in this great room tonight, to every citizen watching across our land -- and there are a lot of them -- this is your time to choose. So important. Got to get out. You've got to vote. It will all be taken away if they get control, including -- they'll start appointing Supreme Court judges that you will not want."
01:11:32 - 01:12:04 (32 sec),"We'll have justices that you will say, how did this happen? You got to get out and vote. It's time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. Never forget that in 2016 we had the greatest movement in the history of our country."
01:12:04 - 01:12:40 (36 sec),"And they won't challenge that. They even admit that. They're not happy about it. They're not happy. But that was the greatest movement in the history of our country. It is not up to the media or the fake news or the pundits to decide your fate. It is up to you. You have the power. With your vote, you can do so much, but you can defend your family, defend your community, defend your country, defend your rights, your faith, and your dignity."
01:12:40 - 01:13:22 (42 sec),"Loyal citizens like you, Iowa and Nebraska, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power back to the American patriots, which is you. These states were settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women. The women actually were stronger than men, but I don't want to get into that."
01:13:22 - 01:13:44 (22 sec),"I don't want to get into that! The women are stronger than the men. I've said it for a long time. Sorry, men. Sorry, you guys. You know what I'm talking about, right? They're all nodding. You're right. Who have braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home right here. They didn't have a lot of money."
01:13:44 - 01:14:19 (35 sec),"They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They loved their families. They loved their country. And they loved their God. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage."
01:14:19 - 01:14:54 (35 sec),"For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory."
01:14:54 - 01:15:48 (54 sec),"Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you, Nebraska. Thank you. Get out and vote."
00:00:00 - 00:00:53 (54 sec),"Hello, Pennsylvania. Hello, Pennsylvania. Great people. Incredible people. And I'm thrilled to be here tonight in Erie, Pennsylvania, with thousands of loyal, hard-working, and beautiful American patriots. That's what you are. Before we begin, I want to send our thoughts and prayers of our entire nation to everyone in the path of Hurricane Michael, especially in the Florida panhandle, where it's hitting and hitting hard."
00:00:53 - 00:01:29 (35 sec),"It's a big one, one of the biggest we've ever seen. All of Pennsylvania, all of America sends its unwavering love and support. My administration is working closely with Florida Governor Rick Scott and the governors of North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, anybody else affected, to provide the full resources and steadfast support of our federal government."
00:01:29 - 00:02:00 (31 sec),"We are... We're all set to go. We're going to follow it right in. We have massive amounts of water and food. And we have the electric companies, thousands and thousands of electrical workers, they're going to follow it as it leaves. We're going to follow right behind. Help the situation. Everyone's working in close coordination with local officials."
00:02:00 - 00:02:32 (32 sec),"And I'll be traveling to Florida very, very shortly, so we just want to wish them all the best. And Godspeed. Godspeed. God bless you all. And you know -- and I speak because so many of my friends are here with us in Pennsylvania, we will spare no effort, no expense, no resource to help these great fellow citizens of ours that are going through a tough time right now."
00:02:32 - 00:03:15 (42 sec),"We know when Americans face hardship, we support each other, we stand with each other, we care for each other, and we will always pull through. It will be successful. We will always be successful at what we do. Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, again, two weeks ago, and now they're going to get a lot more water coming in. That's what they don't need is water right now."
00:03:15 - 00:03:49 (35 sec),"These are great people. Tonight we are going to discuss the extraordinary achievements we've made for our fellow citizens in less than two years' time. You know, it's been less than two years. All those beautiful red hats, Make America Great Again... And we will discuss the next steps we must take to protect this amazing progress and to continue building an even greater future for all Americans."
00:03:49 - 00:04:32 (43 sec),"That's what's happening. You look at what's going on. It's been incredible. I said the other night -- and you know that these folks will dispute us if we're wrong. But this has been the greatest revolution ever to take place in our country. Here we are. The greatest ever. I remember, during the primaries and prior to the election, they were saying, wow, this is -- this is something not -- there's been nothing like this since Ronald Reagan."
00:04:32 - 00:04:54 (22 sec),"Then it kept going and going and going, and then we actually won. In Tennessee, I remember a great Congressmen Duncan, they said, he said, sir, early voting. He said, sir, they're coming from the hills, the valleys, people that haven't voted for a long time because they didn't want to vote for the people that were running for office."
00:04:54 - 00:05:33 (39 sec),"And they've got Trump banners and Trump hats and Trump tattoos. I've never seen anything like it. All about you. And he was right. [Audience Chants USA] And then after that, they said, well, we have to go back further than Ronald Reagan, so they talk about Andrew Jackson and said, let's see, the 1830s, that's a long time."
00:05:33 - 00:06:04 (32 sec),"And then they said on election night that this superseded even Andrew Jackson. So you won it. It's yours. And we're doing well. We're doing well. We are producing and doing even better than we said we would. It's been amazing. This election is about your families, your values, and what kind of country you want to leave for your children."
00:06:04 - 00:06:54 (50 sec),"This election is about keeping America safe, keeping America strong, keeping America proud, keeping America free. And this has been a historic week for our nation. And you know what I'm talking about. You know, all my life I've heard that a president's most important decision is who he or she picks for the United States Supreme Court."
00:06:54 - 00:07:41 (47 sec),"And as you know, on Monday night, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh now sits alongside Justice Gorsuch... to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom. Two great men. They will go down as great, great justices of the Supreme Court."
00:07:41 - 00:08:25 (44 sec),"You watch. What the radical Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh and his beautiful family is a national disgrace. It's a disgrace. What they did was a disgrace. You look at Cory Booker, the way he talked, and then you look at what he did. You look at Senator Dianne Feinstein, what she did. The disgraceful behavior."
00:08:25 - 00:09:19 (54 sec),"The disgraceful leaking of documents. You look at what they did. You look at the false charges. You look at the false accusations. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace! And people were saying, thank you, sir, for sticking and thank you for not giving up. You know what? I never even thought of it, folks. I never even thought of it. Never even thought of it. But on November 6th, you can vote to reject the Democrats' shameful conduct by electing Republican House and, really, we need it badly, we need these votes, a Republican Senate."
00:09:19 - 00:10:03 (44 sec),"Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first. Just two days ago, the unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level in 50 years. It was just announced that manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high."
00:10:03 - 00:10:21 (18 sec),"Historic. Big thing, confidence. You remember the previous administration? They said, oh, you can't bring back manufacturing jobs. Really? You can't bring back... That was wrong. Remember they said you'd need a magic wand. Well, we've got -- I guess we have, right -- we have a magic wand. And those are our great jobs."
00:10:21 - 00:11:04 (43 sec),"And we are unleashing the power of Pennsylvania shale and clean, beautiful Pennsylvania coal, beautiful, beautiful, clean coal. We are putting our miners back to work. We are putting our steelworkers back to work. And by the way, I don't know how many people are in the steel industry, but one of the hottest industries -- and this was dying."
00:11:04 - 00:11:33 (29 sec),"The steel industry was dead and dying. One of the hottest industries right now in our country is American steel. U.S. Steel is opening and expanding seven different plants and spending a tremendous -- billions of dollars doing it. And what does it mean for you? Jobs, jobs, very simple. What does it mean for our country?"
00:11:33 - 00:12:05 (32 sec),"What does it mean for our country? We can't lose the steel industry. The steel industry was on its last legs, and now, after four months of really intensely doing what I do... it's thriving. It is thriving. It's amazing, actually. It's amazing. You got to have steel. You know, you need steel for defense."
00:12:05 - 00:12:35 (30 sec),"You got to have steel. Supposing you don't have steel and we do have a problem defense-wise. You going to call China, please send us some steel? And aluminum is doing great again. These are things we have to have. But beyond that, it's tremendous numbers of jobs already taking place. The head of U.S. Steel said he's never seen anything like it. And what did we do? We essentially stopped the dumping."
00:12:35 - 00:13:00 (25 sec),"They were dumping garbage all over our country. It wasn't even good. It was sand steel. It was rotted steel. It was garbage. They're dumping it all over our country. So now we can take our own metallurgic ore out of our mines that we can bring it here and to other places, and we can actually have our industry."
00:13:00 - 00:13:24 (23 sec),"We don't need this product coming in untested from other countries. We don't need it, folks. We've got it here. We don't need it. And you watch what's going to happen with jobs, and you watch what's going to happen with price. Very proud of that industry. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation."
00:13:24 - 00:14:09 (46 sec),"But if Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats... take over Congress, they will try to raise your taxes -- we've lowered them tremendously -- impose socialism, which is where they're coming from... and take over and destroy American health care. And you see how well we're doing with health care. You see it. Democrats want to abolish America's borders and allow drugs and gangs to pour into our country unabated."
00:14:09 - 00:14:51 (42 sec),"And I say this, and I mean this. The Democrats are the party of crime. That's what's happening. They are the party of crime. Republicans are the party of law, order, and justice. And we are also the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. You see that. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by several really terrific friends of mine, Pennsylvania Republicans, including a man that's helped me so much in Washington, like tax cuts, like regulation cuts, like many other things, Congressman GT Thompson."
00:14:51 - 00:15:20 (29 sec),"A man who's really doing well, if you believe in polls. I believe in polls. Only the ones that have us up, because they're the only honest ones. [Laughter] Other than that, they're the fake news poll. Fake news. Fake news. You know they take these polls, they show them, I said, that can't be right. What they want to do is keep you out of the voting booth."
00:15:20 - 00:15:56 (36 sec),"Take your wife, take your husband, go to a movie, come back, watch the results. You say, you know, I love so and so, but the polls say he can't win. Darling, let's go to a movie tonight. We'll go home and we'll watch -- and that's what happens. They talk you out of it. They're dishonest. just like their reporting is dishonest, their polls are dishonest."
00:15:56 - 00:16:18 (22 sec),"Not all of them. Not all of them. No, not all of them. But many of them, and I saw it. I saw it. And yet there were some that got us very right on that great, great evening. Was that the most exciting evening of our lives? Remember, we won Florida? And remember John King, nice guy at CNN, fake news, CNN... Remember, early -- it was early, and we won by a lot."
00:16:18 - 00:16:53 (34 sec),"We won Florida by a lot. Remember the red, right, the red, beautiful red. I never liked red so much. [Laughter] Against the blue, I didn't like blue. [Laughter] And the whole map is like red. And he's going crazy. But early, Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Oh, my gosh. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida."
00:16:53 - 00:17:27 (35 sec),"Oh, that was upsetting to him. Remember when they said that Texas would be long, it would be a long call, go late into the night, because they said it's just going to be too close to call? So the polls closed at 8 o'clock, and they never call them early unless you win by a landslide, right? So the polls closed."
00:17:27 - 00:18:13 (46 sec),"The polls have closed in the state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. Right? Which other one? Utah, remember it was so -- it was so close, Utah. They had a guy that I never saw before. I don't know. There's this guy. Do you know who I'm talking about? And they had crooked Hillary, the three of us. And this guy was supposed to come in second, but I was going to be -- it's going to be very close."
00:18:13 - 00:18:36 (23 sec),"Maybe I could edge, but this guy was going to come either first or second, and crooked Hillary was supposed to be third. So, the Utah, great people. We just gave over millions of acres of great space, public space to Utah. So what happens? What happens? So they say, oh, for weeks I'm hearing how close Utah is. So the polls close at 8 o'clock."
00:18:36 - 00:19:23 (47 sec),"Eight o'clock and three seconds, Donald Trump has won... the state of Utah. We won it by... And on top of that, this guy came in third. He didn't even come in second. Crooked Hillary came in second. A long ways away. Long ways. Remember? Anyway. But was that the most exciting night? Was that the greatest?"
00:19:23 - 00:19:44 (21 sec),"Well, if you look at it, when you think of it, there was collusion between Hillary, the Democrats, and Russia. There was collusion. There's no question about it. There was a lot of collusion with them and Russia and lots of other people, by the way. But so you remember -- so we win Florida, then we had a -- you know, to win the Electoral College is very tough."
00:19:44 - 00:20:04 (20 sec),"The other is easier. You go to three or four states and you work, and you do -- but to win, got to be smart. You're right. You got to be smart. Got to be smart. You got to -- and you have to have great support. This is our support. But you got to run the whole East Coast. If you're a Republican, it's very, very hard."
00:20:04 - 00:20:27 (23 sec),"Electoral College is much harder than anything. Remember, they said, there is no path. I heard this so many times. I said to my wife, oh -- our first lady, how's she doing? Good? I said to Melania, I said, I've heard there is no path, there is no path to 270. Right? How many times have you heard that? Thousands?"
00:20:27 - 00:20:49 (22 sec),"I've been hearing it for months. There is no path. And I kept going -- I love this state -- I kept going to Maine, for one, because they had -- maybe, if I have a great night, 269. Of course they could never say I could get to -- so I kept going to Maine five times, because I wanted to get one, and I ended up getting the one in Maine, but I also got Michigan, and Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania."
00:20:49 - 00:21:20 (31 sec),"Remember that? Remember that? And what angered me, because I love this state, and I went to school in this state, right? I went to school in this state. I love Pennsylvania. I went to school in this state. Great place. Great people. What angered me is Pennsylvania hasn't been won for many years by Republicans, but every Republican thinks they're going to win Pennsylvania."
00:21:20 - 00:21:43 (23 sec),"They didn't quite get it. But I got it. The workers, I got it. Every Republican -- I used an expression. You know, there's an expression, but under the rules of ""Me, Too,"" I'm not allowed to use that expression anymore. Can't do it. [Laughter] It's the person that got away. See, in the old days, it was a little different."
00:21:43 - 00:22:04 (21 sec),"Pennsylvania -- I'll just do it anyway. I would do it, except for these people up there. They would say, did you hear what President Trump said? Did you hear what he said? So there is expression, but we'll change the expression. Pennsylvania was always the person that got away. That's pretty good, right?"
00:22:04 - 00:22:31 (27 sec),"The person that got -- and for many years, nobody -- no Republican won Pennsylvania. And -- but they always thought they were going to. Pennsylvania, great. And then they lost it by a lot. I said I know we're going to win Pennsylvania, but all night long, they had one point. But if I lost every single vote in Pennsylvania, I was 99 percent of the vote cast, and I said, will you please project Pennsylvania?"
00:22:31 - 00:22:56 (25 sec),"Let Pennsylvania be the state where I win this election? I was winning North Carolina, South Carolina. We won Florida. We were doing -- we were running the East Coast. And I kept saying, why aren't they -- and ask them. Ask them. Why aren't they announcing Pennsylvania? One point left, 99 percent of the vote cast, right?"
00:22:56 - 00:23:21 (24 sec),"Ninety-nine percent of the vote cast. One point left. If I lost every single vote, I won Pennsylvania by a lot. I kept saying, why aren't they announcing Pennsylvania? I thought it must be some kind of a technical malfunction. [Laughter] So they didn't do it until late in the evening. It stayed forever. I kept going, why aren't they announcing?"
00:23:21 - 00:24:10 (50 sec),"I'd love to win with Pennsylvania. But honestly, then what happened? Out of the blue, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. And then out of the blue, first time in decades, Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. And then finally they announced, late in the morning, which we knew they just couldn't do it. They couldn't do it. They just couldn't. Donald Trump has won the great state of Pennsylvania."
00:24:10 - 00:24:28 (18 sec),"They didn't do it that way. They didn't do it that way. They didn't do it that way. They did it with tears flowing down their face. This can't be happening. Can this -- did you see some of them crying? And we were all crying, too, out of happiness, right? Because there has never been anything like what we all did."
00:24:28 - 00:24:55 (26 sec),"OK? We did it together. And now we're doing great trade deals. We're fixing our military. We're taking care of our vets. We are doing so much. We're cutting regulations. So you have a congressional candidate running, taking the place of a fantastic person. You know who that is. But you have a man named John Joyce who's running, and he's way up in the polls, but don't let that fool you."
00:24:55 - 00:25:35 (41 sec),"Get out and vote. Get out and vote. John Joyce. Where is John? Thank you, John. State Senators Dan Laughlin and Michele Brooks, and your next governor of the state of Pennsylvania -- I'll tell you, this guy is working hard, folks. He said he did 631 events. I said that's a lot. [Laughter] I'll tell you, he's a really good man and he's a hard-worker, and I know it's a tough race."
00:25:35 - 00:26:10 (35 sec),"But based on competence, based on everything, very successful guy. Successful businessman, which we like. Scott Wagner. Scott? And maybe the best thing I can say about Scott Wagner is that Judge Jeanine thinks he's fantastic, OK? That might be the greatest endorsement. And I -- you have my full endorsement."
00:26:10 - 00:26:37 (27 sec),"That might be the greatest endorsement I can give you, Scott. Judge Jeanine. I'm especially thrilled to introduce a terrific Pennsylvania congressmen. He's been a friend of mine for a long time, long before I did this whole political thing. A congressmen came up to me the other day, he said, sir, I've been winning for many years and I'm a proud congressmen."
00:26:37 - 00:26:58 (20 sec),"I've won many races, 10 to be exact. I've only lost three. I said, you lost three? Yes, a long time ago, when I was young. And I'm very proud, I'm a real professional. I said, you know, I've never thought of it that way, but I've only ran one time, one... It was for the presidency. And we won the presidency, right?"
00:26:58 - 00:27:38 (40 sec),"We won the president. Now, I had to do it, because he was bragging about his political career. This wasn't Mike Kelly, by the way. Somebody else. And I had to do it. I said, I never thought of it that way, but I ran one time, and we won. OK. And it's also the presidency, right? So, you know. But a man that's been a friend of mine for a long time, he's a tremendous man, and his name is Congressmen Mike Kelly."
00:27:38 - 00:28:20 (42 sec),"He loves you people. And just like your other congressmen, and John Joyce, just like your other congressmen, Mike is strong on crime, tough as hell on borders, powerful on trade, and he is really great on jobs. You see what he's doing. Mike was leading the fight, along with JT and the others, in Congress to cut your taxes, which we did at a level that they haven't seen before, cut regulations, and to protect American workers and American steelworkers."
00:28:20 - 00:28:55 (35 sec),"We're going to dredge the channel to Lake Erie. And we're going to replenish the sand to Presque Isle. Do you know what Presque Isle is? Presque Isle. They've been talking about that for a long time. Mike keeps calling, sir, we want to fix up Presque Isle. I said, Mike, what the hell is Presque Isle? [Laughter] He said, sir, it's a beautiful beach."
00:28:55 - 00:29:32 (37 sec),"I had a picture sent to me. There's no sand. That's what he wants. He wants sand. And we're going to get him the sand, OK? We're going to get him the sand. So, he's a great guy. You got to go vote for him. Let me just invite just for a couple of seconds, Mike, please, come on up. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:29:32 - 00:30:09 (37 sec),"Oh, OK, you know what? Listen, listen, President Trump and I have so much in common. First of all, he loves Pennsylvania... and he -- and he made a commitment tonight. He said, what can we do to make it even better in Erie than it is now? What can we do to take the greatest of the Great Lakes and make it better?"
00:30:09 - 00:30:38 (29 sec),"I said, Mr. President, we need to get sand replenishment. He said, how much do you need? I said, I'm not sure. He said, let me know. You're knowing to get that sand. Yeah! And then he said, so what else? What else? I said, you know what, we need to get some dredging done in the channel so that we don't have to light load any more, our ships can come in and out and get out to the world and bring goods in at a much cheaper price."
00:30:38 - 00:31:30 (52 sec),"He said, you know what, we're going to do that, too! And then I said to the president, you know what, Mr. President, you and I have a lot more in common than probably most people understand. And he goes, what would that be? I said, well, sir, we both married up. [Laughter] We both married up! So this beautiful girl standing beside me tonight, mother of four, grandmother of 10, and five of them are over there right now with my son, George, retired Army captain, and they're here because they love this president."
00:31:30 - 00:32:02 (32 sec),"Look, you know that in 2016, candidate Donald Trump came here to this same arena, to a crowd that was almost as big as this. My god, we got thousands of people outside that just want to get in. There's just not enough room for all the love. The president as a candidate said, this will not be my first trip to Erie, Pennsylvania."
00:32:02 - 00:32:34 (32 sec),"This will not be my first time to stand on the shores of the Great Lake Erie. He said, I will be back. But you know what he also did? He made promises to us in 2016. And people said, no, no, no, there's no way he can do that. There's no way we can get there. My gosh, we just spent eight years of somebody telling us in the White House that America's best days have left her."
00:32:34 - 00:33:30 (56 sec),"And you foolish, foolish people. You Americans actually still seem to think that you're exceptional. You are not exceptional! I want to tell you something. Promises made, promises kept. The strongest personality, the strongest president we have seen in our lifetime! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! [Audience Chants USA] Listen, I got to tell you, the last 21 months of my life, I have seen something happen in America that I had never seen before."
00:33:30 - 00:33:57 (27 sec),"I have seen the resurrection of the greatest nation the world has ever known. It knows no boundaries. It doesn't differentiate because of the color of your skin, the shape of your eye, what your gender is, where you worship. Every single American and at every single way every single day is stronger because of this man."
00:33:57 - 00:34:28 (31 sec),"You're the best. You are the best! Now, let me let you in on a little secret. You know, all of us deplorables are here tonight. Yeah, we're all here! But you know there's another group out there that says, you know what, we've got to win these midterms. We've got to knock this president off his perch. We've got to knock America down a notch or two."
00:34:28 - 00:35:12 (44 sec),"Well, I'll tell you, the president said, we're going to win, and we're going to keep on winning, and you're going to get tired of winning. I'll tell you, in Erie, Pennsylvania, we never get tired of winning. That's who we are! I'm going to ask you all -- I'm going to ask you all to do one thing tonight. As you look at this gentleman, who left a life that was so comfortable, who left a life that was so luxurious, to be torn apart every day, to have our first lady attacked every day, to have the first family attacked every day... that is not who we are."
00:35:12 - 00:35:53 (42 sec),"Now, you know how you're going to change that? You're going to take the enthusiasm you have tonight, you're going to take the love that you have in your heart for the greatest country in the greatest nation in the history of mankind, and you're going to get out and vote. You're going to show up in numbers that nobody ever thought would turn out."
00:35:53 - 00:37:09 (75 sec),"Now, listen. There's an old saying. You've got to play it through the whistle. Right? You got to play it through the whistle. You know what this man's saying is? You've got to play it through the echo of the whistle. Listen, I am so grateful and so thankful that an American citizen came out of nowhere to take the reins and reform and recommit this country to the greatest, greatest nation the world's ever known."
00:37:09 - 00:37:15 (7 sec),"I got to tell you, I'm with you, we're all together. Let's go win! Let's go win! Let's go win! [Audience Chants USA]"
00:37:15 - 00:37:35 (19 sec),"What do you think of that, folks? And, truly, look, he's in good shape. You see that. How would you like to be his opponent? [Laughter] But still, you never know. A vote for Mike is a vote to make America great again. It's very simple. I want to introduce another congressmen who has been a friend of mine, also, for a long time."
00:37:35 - 00:37:59 (25 sec),"And he had a very sad day yesterday. He lost his brother. He lost his brother. And he loved his brother like crazy. I said, how close? He said the closest. And a very, very strange, horrible thing happened. And he doesn't want to talk about it. But I will tell you it's a hard thing for him. And he loves this state, he loves the people."
00:37:59 - 00:38:23 (24 sec),"He's been an incredible congressman. He was a politician and various things. He went on to become a great congressman. He is so respected in Washington. And the only bad thing when he said he's going to do this, at my suggestion, I said, Lou, I'm telling you, you can win. And he said, well, if you think it's important."
00:38:23 - 00:38:56 (33 sec),"It was really at my suggestion. In other words, I got him into this. [Laughter] It could have been for the rest of his life. He could have been a congressman. But he's a special man. He's a total winner. And he had a rough time the last few days. And something else happened on top of that. But I'm honored to introduce the next United States senator from the state of Pennsylvania, my good friend, Lou Barletta. [Audience Chants Lou]"
00:38:56 - 00:39:31 (35 sec),"Thank you. Thank you very much. You know, Mr. President, I happen how much you love Pennsylvania. This is like the 9th or 10th time that you've been here. And each time that you come, the list of promises made, promises kept gets longer and longer. And that's OK with us, because now you're overseeing the greatest economy in American history right now."
00:39:31 - 00:40:01 (29 sec),"This economy is soaring. GDP last month was 4.2 percent. Unemployment, 3.7 percent. Four million new jobs were created. And this is the stat I love the most: Four million Americans came off of food stamps. Four million Americans came off of food stamps. Black unemployment at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment at an all-time low."
00:40:01 - 00:40:27 (27 sec),"Women's unemployment at a 64-year low. There are more jobs than people who are unemployed. And I'll tell you how good the economy is: This economy is so good that even Colin Kaepernick found a job. Now, who would want to stop that? Who would want to stop what's happening to the American people right now?"
00:40:27 - 00:40:54 (27 sec),"I'll tell you who wants to stop it: Bob Casey wants to stop it. Senator Bob Casey went to Washington and he forgot about Pennsylvania. He became -- in Washington, he became -- it's no surprise -- he became one of the most liberal senators in Washington. He no longer represents Pennsylvania values. I'll tell you how radical -- I'll tell you how radical he has become."
00:40:54 - 00:41:22 (28 sec),"He is so radical that he said he will vote no, no matter who the president nominates for the next Supreme Court pick. No matter who. Now, he started this craziness. He started this craziness by saying he'd be the first senator to vote no, no matter what. If you don't like the way that Justice Kavanaugh has been treated, then you can't reward Bob Casey by sending him back to Washington ever again."
00:41:22 - 00:41:51 (29 sec),"Listen, it's pretty clear -- it's pretty clear why I'm running for Senate. I'm running for Senate because the president did call and he said, I need you in the Senate. I'm running there because I want to help him because we want to show respect for our law enforcement in America once again. We want to take care of our veterans."
00:41:51 - 00:42:09 (17 sec),"No veterans should ever and will ever die waiting in line for health care in this country ever again. And we're going to support our military, those men and women who travel all over this world to make sure that we have the freedoms that we have and enjoy today and that our children and grandchildren will have that same freedom."
00:42:09 - 00:42:53 (45 sec),"We're going -- we're going to take care of our seniors. We're going to protect the unborn. We're going to put an end to illegal immigration. We're going to -- we're going to build the wall. We're going to build the way. And we are going to kneel when we pray and stand for the flag. No, Mr. President. No, Mr. President, we're not tired of winning in Pennsylvania. We're going to win again in November. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States. Thank you. [Audience Calls Out Lou]"
00:42:53 - 00:43:37 (43 sec),"That's great, Lou. Thank you very much. He's a great man. He's really -- he'll be a fantastic representative for you in Washington, D.C. Got to get out and vote. [Audience Calls Out Lou] So while Lou is fighting for you, Bob Casey is fighting to protect violent criminal aliens. That's what he's doing. Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country."
00:43:37 - 00:44:03 (27 sec),"He'll do it. For example, the sanctuary city of Philadelphia, can you believe this? Could you believe that one? That one I didn't expect to be hearing -- released a criminal alien who was recently convicted of raping and battering a very young child. Bob Casey defends criminals while attacking our brave ICE agents."
00:44:03 - 00:44:46 (43 sec),"He wants to get rid of ICE. Let me tell you about ICE. These are tough, brave people that love our country. These are people that MS-13, they're afraid of ICE. They don't like seeing ICE. And if we don't have ICE, you'll pay a big price. These are great people. These are great people. Lou Barletta and the Republican Party will always stand for the heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and our great, great law enforcement."
00:44:46 - 00:45:19 (33 sec),"These are great people. Bob Casey even voted against Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was gunned down by a five-time deported illegal alien, should have never been in our country. Bob Casey puts criminal aliens before American citizens, always has. By the way, how do you have such a liberal guy in the state of Pennsylvania?"
00:45:19 - 00:46:16 (57 sec),"I'm trying to figure that out. Oh, he's banking on the name of his father. That's no good. Which is why he needs to be voted out of office. He has to be voted out of office. Casey also voted against tax cuts, against Pennsylvania coal. He joined the left-wing mob by voting against Brett Kavanaugh. If you want to save American lives, and save American jobs, and keep things going like they're going now, which is better economically than any time in the history of our country... then you need to vote for a pro-American patriot, and he really is a patriot -- he loves this country -- named Lou Barletta."
00:46:16 - 00:46:43 (27 sec),Get out and vote please. [Audience Calls Out Lou] Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats support a socialist takeover of health care that would totally obliterate Medicare. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and who have paid for it all their lives.
00:46:43 - 00:47:23 (39 sec),"And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We're going to protect people that need help, people with pre-existing conditions. If you want security for your family, for yourself, if you want to continue our great economic boom like we've never seen before, but it's all very fragile, it can end, they want to end it, then you must go out and vote Republican."
00:47:23 - 00:47:59 (37 sec),"We need those votes in D.C. Since the election, as Lou has said, we've created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million people off of food stamps. We've added almost 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. They were supposed to be gone forever. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history."
00:47:59 - 00:48:57 (57 sec),"History. That's in history. Think of that. In history. It's got its best level on unemployment. Think of that. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in poverty. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment has always reached historic lows, lowest in history. And as I always say -- I'm sure you've heard it, I hate to say it again because I know the number is going to be changing very soon, it's going to be even better, women's unemployment has just fallen to 3.6 percent, which is only the lowest rate in 65 years."
00:48:57 - 00:49:22 (25 sec),"I'm sorry. I keep saying it. I keep waiting for that number. I'm sorry, I'd like to apologize to the women, please. Sixty-five years, best in 65 years. I keep waiting for the new number to come out, because that will be history, too, just like African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American. Women, it's only the best number in 65 years."
00:49:22 - 00:49:55 (34 sec),"I'd like to apologize. But it's very true. Women. Women for Trump. Women for Trump. Remember how badly I was going to do with women? I said, am I so bad? Remember how badly? And then I got 52 percent of the vote! And everybody said he beat crooked Hillary. What happened? What -- remember that? Remember they put up these phony numbers?"
00:49:55 - 00:50:26 (31 sec),"But you remember that? We did very well. Thank you to the women. We did very well. She never got it. The truth is she never got it. And she still doesn't get it. She's going around on a tour. Did you know this? Did you know that? I said, you should have saved it for the election. After years of being let down by Washington politicians, you now have a champion fighting for you in the White House."
00:50:26 - 00:50:58 (32 sec),"But I need your help this Election Day, November 6th, to stop the radical Democrat mob from trying to take it away. And they're going to try and take it away. They're going to try and take it away. I need you to show up at the polls to continue this incredible movement, like the country has never seen before, like probably very few countries, frankly, have ever seen before."
00:50:58 - 00:51:37 (38 sec),"The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. Then you should vote Democrat. For many years, our country was being pillaged and plundered by unfair trade deals. Pennsylvania lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs -- you know it well -- I spent lots of time with you folks up here. You know it well -- following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance, pushed by us, into the WTO, World Trade Organization, perhaps the only deal worse than NAFTA."
00:51:37 - 00:52:13 (36 sec),"We got 'em both. They were both beauties, weren't they? But the era of economic surrender is over. America is not being taken advantage of any more. Sorry. America is respected again. America is respected again. Last week, I announced that we are replacing NAFTA with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement called USMCA."
00:52:13 - 00:52:55 (43 sec),"I didn't want to use the word NAFTA. To create jobs that boost incomes, Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We've taken historic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. Did you see -- did you see four weeks ago when Pfizer and Novartis and other drug companies raised the prices of their drugs very, very substantially?"
00:52:55 - 00:53:22 (26 sec),"And I didn't like it. And I called them. I said, you can't do that. You can't do that. And the first time -- and I give them credit. And I really thank them, too, honestly. But first time in history, they rescinded their price increase and they kept it the same, and they promised no increase for a substantial time."
00:53:22 - 00:53:49 (27 sec),"But we're going to get them down. And when I called them up and they agreed to immediately rescind, perhaps that's the first time I realized how powerful it is to be the president of the United States. That was pretty -- that was pretty good. But I give them a lot of credit, and I appreciate it. We're going to get the prescription prices down, though."
00:53:49 - 00:54:12 (23 sec),"We just signed new legislation today, and there's more coming, because you are being ripped off. You know, for the same pill, for the same drug, for the same company that makes it, the same package, you go to other countries, and you'll pay half and you'll pay less than half. It's a rigged system. You remember what else I called rigged?"
00:54:12 - 00:54:44 (32 sec),"I call plenty of things in this country rigged, but we're straightening it out. But it was a rigged system. Plenty of things rigged. And to help critically ill patients access life-saving treatments, we passed something called right to try. People that are terminally ill were given no chance, no hope. We have incredible drugs in the pipeline that can cure really horrible, horrific disease."
00:54:44 - 00:55:16 (32 sec),"We wouldn't let anyone use these drugs because they didn't want to hurt them, but they're going to die. They're terminally ill! I said, what are we doing? And two months ago, I signed right to try. Somebody's terminally ill, we can try. And we've had great success. We've had great success. And by the way, in all fairness, you also find out whether or not it works."
00:55:16 - 00:55:33 (18 sec),"Not so bad. Right to try. You know what it did? These people, if they had money, they'd travel all over the world looking for a cure. If they didn't have money, they'd go home. There was nothing -- they had no hope. No -- they had no hope. Now they have great hope. We make the greatest products in the world."
00:55:33 - 00:56:00 (27 sec),"We make the greatest medicine, and we'd have hope. And some incredible things have already happened with right to try. They've been trying to pass it for 40 years. We got it passed, and that's because of your congressmen. That's because of your congressmen. That are with us tonight. We also passed veterans' choice."
00:56:00 - 00:56:38 (37 sec),"Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. Right? Our veterans. Forty-four years, they tried to pass it. When I first heard about it, I mean, it's not like I was studying it for my whole life. But I heard about it three-and-a-half years ago. I said, I have an idea. Let's -- when they wait on line for 10 days, 22 days, 38 days, you have to see, months and months, why don't we let them go see a private doctor and we paid the bill?"
00:56:38 - 00:57:05 (27 sec),"It will solve our problem. And I told everybody: I am the most brilliant guy in the world. Who else would think -- who else would think of that? So I go back to my people. I say, listen, I have this great idea. We can get these great vets to see the doctors. It's taken -- like 10 days was good. But some of them were ill, but not terribly ill."
00:57:05 - 00:57:25 (20 sec),"It took them so long, they would literally become terminally ill. It took them weeks and weeks to see a doctor. So I went to my people and I said, what an idea this is! They said, actually, sir, we've been trying to get that idea passed for 44 years. I'm good at getting things passed. We signed it three months ago."
00:57:25 - 00:57:58 (33 sec),"For our vets. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our great veterans can be held accountable. In other words, they're immediately fired. Not easy to get passed. They've been trying that one for about 46 years. We got that one passed, too. You think that was easy, getting that by -- I know you have a lot of union guys here."
00:57:58 - 00:58:26 (29 sec),"But do you think that was easy getting that by the unions? Do you think that was easy getting that passed by civil service? Not too easy. We got it passed. Somebody does something bad to our veterans, we fire them on the spot. And we secured $716 billion to fully rebuild the American military. And we gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in almost a decade."
00:58:26 - 00:59:07 (41 sec),"At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force. Very important. It's where it's at. That's where it's going. We want to always be the best. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. And I've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem."
00:59:07 - 00:59:40 (33 sec),"Many, many presidents talked about they were going to do it, and they never had whatever it takes to do it. [Laughter] And I understand why, because there was a lot of pressure on that one. There were a lot of forces saying don't do it. I say, excuse me, get lost. But we did it. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
00:59:40 - 01:00:17 (37 sec),"Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Pennsylvania. We are standing proudly for our national anthem. I need you to get your friends, get your families, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican. Vote for Lou."
01:00:17 - 01:00:59 (42 sec),"Vote for Mike. Vote for all of these great people here. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products made right here in the USA. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is the vote for safety, opportunity, prosperity, and justice."
01:00:59 - 01:01:59 (60 sec),"It is not up to the media or the pundits to decide your fate. It is up to you. It is up to the people of Pennsylvania. It is up to the people of our country. You have the power with your vote to defend your family, your country, your values, your faith, and, indeed, to defend your dignity. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power back to the American people where it belongs."
01:01:59 - 01:02:31 (32 sec),"Pennsylvania is the state that rang the Liberty Bell, forged the railroads, and put steel into the spine of our country. Generations of Pennsylvania workers manned the furnaces, farmed the fields, and fought the battles that made America into the most powerful and prosperous nation in the history of the world."
01:02:31 - 01:03:20 (50 sec),"Unfortunately, years ago, they lost their way, but we have gotten that way back. These courageous Pennsylvania patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our great and proud American heritage. For the sake of freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win."
01:03:20 - 01:04:05 (44 sec),"We will not bend, we will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, and we will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
01:04:05 - 01:04:30 (25 sec),"And always remember, together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:48 (48 sec),"Hello, Johnson City. It is great to be with you. I am thrilled to be back. I look forward to being back in the great state of Tennessee, with thousands of hard-working American patriots. That's what you are. In less than two years, we've achieved the biggest comeback in American history. You look at what's happened."
00:00:48 - 00:01:19 (31 sec),"And our country is respected again. We're respected again. Jobless claims are at a 50-year low. And the stock market is at an all-time high. The economy is booming, wages are rising, and more Americans are working today than ever before. Ever before. And think of that. Think of that. Such a simple statement."
00:01:19 - 00:01:46 (27 sec),"But such a complex thing to do. Think of it. More Americans are working today than ever before. What a beautiful statement. Get out and vote in November. It can all change around quickly, folks. We are defending our Second Amendment, taking care... But Bredesen will not defend your Second Amendment. We're taking care of our great veterans and rebuilding America's military might."
00:01:46 - 00:02:25 (39 sec),"And just today, we made history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job-killing disaster known as NAFTA... with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada -- we added Canada, worked out great -- trade agreement. And we're calling it USMCA. No more NAFTA. No more NAFTA. It's the largest trade deal the United States has ever negotiated."
00:02:25 - 00:03:23 (58 sec),"And it's also a great deal for our country. It's going to produce jobs. And companies aren't going to be leaving and firing everybody and making product and sending it back into the United States, no tax. It's there. It's modern. And it's balanced. And you know what? We have two wonderful partners now. Now they're partners, Mexico and Canada, and that's a good thing."
00:03:23 - 00:03:59 (37 sec),"That's a good thing. America's winning again, and America is being respected again, because we are finally putting America first. But radical Democrats in Congress are trying very hard to erase everything that we've achieved. They're looking out there right now and they're trying to figure out, how do they take an election because they want to take it back?"
00:03:59 - 00:04:07 (8 sec),"You look at your 401(k)s. You know, we're up from the time of the election 55 percent."
00:04:07 - 00:04:28 (21 sec),"I love you, President Trump!"
00:04:28 - 00:04:54 (26 sec),"I love you, too. He doesn't sound like my type. You know, that voice is very strong. But I love him. Whoever you are, I love you. We're just five weeks from one of the most important congressional elections of our lifetime. They're trying to take what we did in '16, something that nobody has seen maybe in other countries, not alone -- it was the greatest election victory in the history of our country."
00:04:54 - 00:05:31 (37 sec),"And between the Democrats, who are obstructionists, who are people that don't want to see strong military, they don't want borders, they don't mind crime... and their enablers, the fake news media, right back there. We've got to be very careful. We've got to be very careful. A Democrat takeover of Congress will plunge our country into gridlock and chaos and take away all of the wealth that you've earned over the last 20 months."
00:05:31 - 00:05:53 (22 sec),"This -- and think of this. The stock market, which is up at record levels, and now the highest, will drop. Your 401(k)s will be devastated. Your taxes will rise beyond your wildest imagination. And crime will flow in to our country through these open borders. Other than that, we'll be doing very well. It's crazy."
00:05:53 - 00:05:53 (0 sec),[Audience chants Built the wall]
00:05:53 - 00:06:36 (43 sec),"And we are. We want to get more money. We want to -- I could build that thing in one year. I could build it. We got $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and another $1.6 billion. We want to build it fast. I can build it -- so after the election, leadership has said, meaning Republicans, they're going to do something that's going to be very strong."
00:06:36 - 00:06:59 (23 sec),"Let's see what happens. But -- but the wall is under construction. A lot of work has been done. A lot of renovation -- if you look at some of it, some wall was up, falling down, terrible condition, now it's beautiful, brand new, and it works. It does work. We need wall. We need border security. We want -- we got to take care of our people."
00:06:59 - 00:07:30 (31 sec),"Look at what's going on. Look at what's going on in California. You have a man running for governor in California that says we don't want any borders. We don't want ICE. We do want sanctuary cities. And they're going to take care of health care, they're going to take care of education, they're going to care of everything for people that just flow in. You're going to have a billion people living in California."
00:07:30 - 00:07:55 (25 sec),"It's going to be a mess. We have it right. We have it going properly. This country will never be Venezuela, that I can tell you, because that's what they're looking for. That's what they're looking for. The Democrat Party has been completely taken over by the so-called resistance. That's all they do. They campaign on resist."
00:07:55 - 00:08:14 (19 sec),"I'll tell you something. They're only good at one thing. They stick together like glue. That's it. They have bad policy. Frankly, they're bad politicians. Everything's bad. But they stick together. We have to be very careful, they'll take everything, including your Second Amendment. They'll take everything away."
00:08:14 - 00:08:49 (35 sec),"Democrats believe that they're entitled to power, and they have been blind in a blind rage ever since, boy, they lost the 2016 -- they've gone loco. They have gone loco. They have gone crazy. This election is a choice between a Republican Party that is building our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down."
00:08:49 - 00:09:16 (27 sec),"The Democrats only know how to obstruct, demolish, and destroy. As we've seen in recent weeks, Democrats are willing to do anything and to hurt anyone to get their way, like they're doing with Judge Kavanaugh. They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he was announced, because they know that Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written."
00:09:16 - 00:09:49 (33 sec),"That's been his history. And he's a good man. Great student, great intellect. Never had a problem. All of a sudden, oh, let's go back to high school. They maybe should go before high school. And I know so many of them. You have the great Vietnam War hero who didn't go to Vietnam -- you know that, right -- Blumenthal."
00:09:49 - 00:10:16 (27 sec),"How about Blumenthal? How about Blumenthal? Da Nang Blumenthal, we call him Da Nang Blumenthal. For 15 years, as the attorney general of Connecticut, he went around telling war stories. People dying left and right, but my platoon marched forward. He was never in Vietnam. It was a lie. And then he's up there -- then he's up there saying we want the truth from Judge Kavanaugh."
00:10:16 - 00:10:56 (40 sec),"And you're getting the truth from Judge Kavanaugh. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Da Nang. You know Da Nang, right? Great city in Vietnam. And then you have Cory Booker, who destroyed Newark. I mean, the job he did in Newark. And see some of the things he wrote when he was young about women. Take a look, OK? And then they want to take a lot longer with the FBI."
00:10:56 - 00:11:19 (23 sec),"No, the FBI -- they should take -- by the way, if we took 10 years, they'd want more time. But they want to take a lot longer. But Dianne Feinstein, she had this... She had this letter for months, and she didn't reveal it until everything was finished. Then she revealed it. Then she says, oh, we want more time."
00:11:19 - 00:11:44 (25 sec),"Let's see how it all works out. But I'll tell you what, they're trying to destroy a very fine person. And we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. Democrats want activist, left-wing judges who will totally rewrite your laws, erase your borders, and replace your values. You don't want that in Tennessee."
00:11:44 - 00:12:05 (21 sec),Republicans know that a judge's job is to follow the law and to deliver equal justice for all. The Democrats can no longer be trusted with your power and with their power. You can't let it happen. They have moved so far left that Pocahontas is considered a conservative. True. That's right. Elizabeth Warren.
00:12:05 - 00:12:46 (41 sec),"She said she's considering a run for the presidency. Please, please run. How about that group, Biden? Biden. We call him 1 percent Biden. Until Obama took him off the trash heap, he couldn't do anything. Now he's talking about running. Tough guy. He's tough guy. He's -- he's a real genius. I want to challenge him to a fight behind the barn."
00:12:46 - 00:13:18 (32 sec),"Oh, would I love that? Wouldn't that be good? I want to challenge Donald Trump. Remember that? He got a little upset. He's another beauty. They got some real beauties going. This November 6th, you have the chance to reject the outrageous policies of the Democrat Party. Not the Democratic Party. But the Democrat Party."
00:13:18 - 00:13:48 (30 sec),"Sounds worse, right? But that's their real name. It's the Democrat Party. But you can only do it. You got to vote for Republican. We need more Republicans to get the votes. Stop the crime. You know, I said the other night, and I said, you know, I think I'm going to keep it. It's a little harsh, but I think I'll keep it. Democrats are the party of crime."
00:13:48 - 00:14:09 (21 sec),"How does that sound? They're the party of crime. Sounds a little tough, but it's true. Open borders. We're thrilled to be joined by many terrific Republican members of Congress, people that are friends of mine, people that have helped me, people that love your state and they love other states and they love our country."
00:14:09 - 00:14:34 (25 sec),"One of them is a man that everybody knows in this state very well. His name is Phil Roe. And he has really helped. Phil? Thank you, Phil. He's always there for you. Thank you, Phil. Another man said -- this is what I was Mr. Trump, not Mr. President -- I was here, he said, you know, we do early voting in Tennessee."
00:14:34 - 00:15:07 (33 sec),"He said, sir, I want to tell you that people are coming out of the mountains, out of the rivers, out of -- they're coming out of the valleys. They're coming -- they said -- right? They're coming out of everywhere. He said, I've never seen anything. I've been doing this stuff for 30 years more. And he said, this is what before -- you know, I'm waiting like we had, like, 30 days, but you have early voting in Tennessee."
00:15:07 - 00:15:32 (25 sec),"So I've never seen anything like it. People that haven't voted, because they haven't liked anybody. These are great people. These are great, incredible people. But they didn't exactly like what they had to go for. So they have a -- now they're coming out with Trump banners, Trump hats, Trump -- you know, make America great again."
00:15:32 - 00:15:57 (25 sec),"And this man -- he said, I can't speak for the rest of our nation, but if the nation's like Tennessee, you're going to win by a lot. And that's exactly what happened, right? John Duncan, Congressman, thank you, John. Where's John? Good. Thank you, John. He made me feel very good before the election. A friend of mine, a great congressman, somebody who's really worked hard."
00:15:57 - 00:16:22 (26 sec),"Even though he's not from your state, does it matter? He's just a great congressman. I see him here. He has been so strong, so smart. He loves this country so much, Congressman Mark Meadows. Thank you, Mark. And Deborah. Deborah, thank you, Deb. Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, who has been fantastic. Where's Chuck?"
00:16:22 - 00:16:48 (26 sec),"Chuck? Thank you, Chuck. Chuck has been great. Morgan Griffith, Scott DesJarlais -- my favorite name in politics. DesJarlais. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. You guys are great. These are really -- these are great people. You know, we don't have to devote a lot of time. I'm just -- these are great people. These are people that love our country."
00:16:48 - 00:17:17 (29 sec),"They want to do the right thing. You know, there's nothing wrong with having strong borders, strong law enforcement. You want to be safe. There's nothing wrong with paying low taxes. There's really nothing wrong. You want to have a strong military, especially in these times. You know, if you have a strong military, you're never going to have to use it. You're never going to have to use it. And we're going to very shortly have the strongest military we've ever had."
00:17:17 - 00:17:35 (18 sec),"We're also joined -- thank you, all -- we're also joined by future Republican members of Congress, Tim Burchett. Where's Tim? Tim? We got to get Tim in there. Tim? Thank you, Tim. John Rose, John, thank you, John. Mark Green, I hear they're up pretty good, but don't take any chances. Don't take any chances."
00:17:35 - 00:17:50 (15 sec),"You've got to go vote. Don't take any chances. We've got to get them in. But they're up pretty good. This is a hell of a state, I'll tell you that. These people... I also want to thank your great governor. I had dinner with him the other night. We were with a group of people. It was a fascinating dinner."
00:17:50 - 00:18:10 (20 sec),"He loves this state, also, and he's done a great job as governor, Governor Bill Haslam. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. Thank you. And Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally, thank you. Thank you, Randy. Great. Great job. Thank you. Great job. And very importantly, we have Tennessee's next governor, Bill Lee. And a man who did a fantastic job during the election for Trump."
00:18:10 - 00:18:30 (20 sec),"I will tell you, State Party Chairman Scott Golden. Thank you, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks. And, finally, the person we are here tonight to support. We cherish this person. She's a fighter. A true fighter for the people of Tennessee. She loves your state. And she's your next U.S. senator, she's going to be fantastic, Marsha Blackburn, Marsha, come up, please."
00:18:30 - 00:18:51 (21 sec),"There we go. Thank you all so much. [Audience Chants Marsha] Thank you. Mr. President, thank you for coming back to Tennessee. We love the president in Tennessee. And I want to say thank you to each of you for being here tonight. Thank you so much for all you are doing to elect all of these Republican candidates that we've talked about tonight."
00:18:51 - 00:20:03 (72 sec),"And thank you for sending Donald J. Trump to the White House. He has had an amazing 20 months. You've just heard some of those things. Not to even mention the foreign policy that he has achieved. Dealing with China, North Korea, getting us out of the Iran deal. And, Mr. President, we in Tennessee really appreciate that you moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem."
00:20:03 - 00:21:00 (57 sec),"Thank you for that. I know -- I know that the Democrats keep saying that there is a blue wave coming, but let me tell you something... Mr. President, when that blue wave gets to the state line, it is going to run smack dab into the great red wall. And that... And that is every single one of you. So if you want a U.S. senator who is going to stand with the president, build the wall, cut your taxes, and to make certain that we take care of our men and women in uniform, I am asking you to stand with me. Let's -- let's take these Tennessee values to Washington, D.C., and put them to work with President Donald Trump."
00:21:00 - 00:21:01 (1 sec),Thank you all. [Audience chants Marsha]
00:21:01 - 00:21:46 (45 sec),"So I just want to thank Marsha Blackburn. And I will you, she's all about Tennessee values. That's the one. She's got Tennessee values. A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for. It's a vote for make America great again. That's what it is. A vote for Bredesen is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... and the real leader of the Democrats, Maxine Waters."
00:21:46 - 00:22:15 (29 sec),"Phil Bredesen wants to raise your taxes. As governor, remember this -- you've got to remember -- seems like a nice guy, but what good does that do? As governor, he raised taxes and fees in your state by more than $1 billion. He opposes the border wall totally. He supported driver certificates for illegal aliens."
00:22:15 - 00:23:30 (75 sec),"And on his watch, Tennessee unemployment doubled. It doubled in the -- whatever it was. How long was he there? Eight? It doubled. You want him to be running -- I don't think so. I don't think so. He doubled unemployment. In 2010, Phil wrote a book advocating government-run health care. That's what you want?"
00:23:30 - 00:24:17 (47 sec),"You want to wait on line for about six weeks to get taken care of? And called for it to be funded by a 20 percent payroll tax on all of the hard-working Americans, many are in this room right now. Government-run health care. No, I don't think so. That hasn't proven too successful anywhere else. Phil was a major financial supporter of President Obama and of Hillary -- crooked Hillary Clinton."
00:24:17 - 00:24:57 (40 sec),"She's crooked as hell. Now Phil is running to be the 51st Senate Democrat and the 51st -- Democrats are elected in November, then Chuck Schumer will become a majority leader. You put in 51. Even though he said something good about our deal with Canada and Mexico today, but how can you not say good? That's why Schumer is so desperate for Phil to win, because everything that we stand for will never get the votes."
00:24:57 - 00:25:29 (32 sec),"We need votes. It's very important. Number one, Marsha will be a great, great senator, but, number two, we need the votes. We've got to have the vote. And he will never once vote for us. Just remember, he will never vote for us. Not on judges. You know, one of the reasons they say I got elected was that Supreme Court judge -- they always say the single most important thing that the president can do is the selection of a Supreme Court judge."
00:25:29 - 00:26:03 (34 sec),"OK. So we picked Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has been fantastic. And now Judge Brett Kavanaugh is actually doing well. I really believe -- we've got to do it. We cannot allow ourselves... to be pushed around. Phil is only running because Chuck Schumer called him up and begged him. The word is begged him to run because Schumer knows the Democrats' path to power runs right through Tennessee."
00:26:03 - 00:26:22 (18 sec),"Again, Second Amendment, higher taxes, lots of crime, MS-13, get used to them. No ICE. We don't want ICE, they say. If you want to stop Schumer from becoming majority leader, if you want to stop your taxes from going up 50 percent or more -- that's what's going to happen -- then you must vote against Bredesen."
00:26:22 - 00:27:07 (45 sec),"Your vote in this election will decide which party controls the Senate. That's how close it is. You know, I'd like to tell you no, but that's how close it is. A Democrat-controlled Senate will always be raising your taxes. They'll always throw open your border. There's nothing you can do. There's nothing he's going to do to change it. He's going to vote with the Democrats."
00:27:07 - 00:27:41 (34 sec),"There's not going to be -- I mean, you look at health care. We got no votes. Look at -- we gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of this country. We didn't get one Democrat vote. And they don't vote for a reason. They just vote because it's bad for Trump. In other words, they want to stop anything that we do. If it's really good, they still want to stop it. And we don't want to let that happen."
00:27:41 - 00:27:53 (12 sec),"We have unbelievable things planned, and we have to let it happen. Flood your streets. They're going to flood your streets with criminal aliens. That's what's going to happen."
00:27:53 - 00:27:55 (2 sec),We love you!
00:27:55 - 00:28:29 (34 sec),"They're always attacking law enforcement. I'll give you an example. Under the Obama administration, we have tremendous amounts of surplus military equipment. Right? Tremendous equipment. You know, heavy armor, lots of different things, that keep the law enforcement professionals, people that we love, that keeps them safe."
00:28:29 - 00:29:11 (42 sec),"They didn't want to give it them. I have given it to them. I'm sorry. They want to block your great judges. They want to weaken the military. They don't -- it's not even weaken. They don't want to spend any money on the military. You know, the beautiful thing about military -- number one, you need it. Everything's like jobs, jobs is very important to me. When it comes to the military, it's not the jobs."
00:29:11 - 00:29:32 (22 sec),"OK? That's totally secondary. But we will soon have the strongest military that we've ever had. We had fighter jets -- we had fighter jets and we had airplanes in our military where the father flew 'em, the grandfather flew 'em, and the son as a young pilot goes in, flying the same planes. You know what?"
00:29:32 - 00:30:01 (29 sec),"They're all going fast. We've ordered all incredible new, finest jets in the world. But the other thing is, they're made right here in the USA. All of them. Jobs, jobs, jobs. They want to outlaw private health insurance. So you'll get great health insurance, and we're already doing it. We're providing you with tremendous amounts of competition."
00:30:01 - 00:30:25 (24 sec),You're getting great health insurance and it's going to get better when we can get a few more votes so we can do it the way you want it. This is the way you want it. They want to shut down American energy and replace freedom with socialism. They want... They want to turn -- it's true -- the Democrats want to turn America into Venezuela.
00:30:25 - 00:30:49 (23 sec),"That'll be wonderful. That'll be wonderful. We're not going to let it happen. And you know what, even most Democrats -- I can't believe -- when you look at what they're doing with sanctuary cities and everything, I can't believe most of them are going for it. Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats in Washington want to raid Medicare to pay for their socialism."
00:30:49 - 00:31:10 (21 sec),"Democrats are pushing so-called medicine for all, robbing our seniors of all of their Medicare benefits. That's what's happening. Republicans want to protect Medicare and our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it. And we always protect Americans with their pre-existing conditions. We're doing that."
00:31:10 - 00:31:42 (32 sec),"On pre-existing conditions, a lot of people think it's not a very Republican thing. It is now, and it has been for me. I want to take care of people with pre-existing conditions. We're doing well. We can do it. Democrats also want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens. Republicans want to protect public benefits."
00:31:42 - 00:32:09 (27 sec),"And we do. We want to protect benefits and public benefits for truly needy Americans, Americans that need help. Democrats want to abolish ICE. In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. And the Democrat Party supports sanctuary cities that unleash violent predators, like MS-13, into our communities."
00:32:09 - 00:32:31 (22 sec),"And remember what I said. It's the party of crime. Democrats -- they really are. You look at what they're doing. Even look at what they're doing in Congress. Even look at what they're doing with our laws, the way they treat our laws, the way they treat country. What they do in Congress. They are indeed the party of crime."
00:32:31 - 00:32:56 (25 sec),"Every day, innocent lives are stolen because of Democrat-supported immigrant policies. If you just take a look, you have immigration policies that are so bad, so dangerous. Just recently in California, an illegal alien with a sex crime conviction and other convictions had a prior deportation. They wanted to deport this person."
00:32:56 - 00:33:28 (32 sec),"They never did. He was convicted for killing a local football coach who leaves behind a wife and six beautiful kids. A pillar of the community. By the way, this is all over. You could go -- you could do this for days. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens."
00:33:28 - 00:33:54 (26 sec),"And Republicans proudly stand with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol, and we stand with law enforcement. This election in November is about safety, and it's also about prosperity. The prosperity of our country. We are doing things now that nobody believes. We are hitting numbers that nobody believes."
00:33:54 - 00:34:30 (36 sec),"Here are just some of our achievements since Election Day. Thank you. We've created over 4 million new jobs. Nobody thought that was possible, 4 million. And lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. We've added nearly 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. That wasn't supposed to happen. Remember when President Obama said you can't do manufacturing?"
00:34:30 - 00:34:53 (23 sec),"Magic wand, right? You'd need a magic wand. You don't need a magic wand. You need proper policies. You need a lot of things. You don't need a magic wand. Remember this. And you've heard me say it a lot. I'm very proud of it. African-American unemployment -- think of it -- African-American unemployment just reached the lowest level ever recorded."
00:34:53 - 00:35:29 (36 sec),"Right? Right? Right? After years of Democrats failing and abandoning African-Americans, Republicans are delivering for African-Americans like never before. We're doing the job. And you saw that the other night with Kanye West. How good was Kanye West? And Big Jim Brown. And so many others. We're supported by so many great folks."
00:35:29 - 00:36:04 (36 sec),"Jim Brown. Boy, we could use him on some of those teams right now, couldn't we? Couldn't we? Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment also reached all-time lows. Women's unemployment recently reached its lowest level in 65 years. That's going to be coming out soon. I think it'll be in history. And last week, I signed a groundbreaking new trade deal with South Korea that dramatically increases American exports."
00:36:04 - 00:36:29 (24 sec),"You remember that deal? Remember that deal? Hillary Clinton -- that was a Hillary deal -- she said we must have this deal with South Korea. It will create 250,000 jobs. And it did for South Korea, not for us. It created jobs for South Korea. We now have a good thing. Friend or foe? Friend or foe? Friend, OK. You never know."
00:36:29 - 00:36:56 (27 sec),"When you hear little noises like that, you say foe, get them out, right? But they're friends. We only have friends in Tennessee, I think. We're also entering new trade talks with the European Union, which, frankly, has treated us extremely badly, and with Japan. Japan sends us millions and millions of cars."
00:36:56 - 00:37:31 (35 sec),"And we're working on a trade deal. We're working on a trade deal. It will be fine. And we are cracking down on China's unfair and abusive trade practices. Got to do it. We've been losing $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 billion a year to China. No more. No more. Right. No more. Can't do it. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation."
00:37:31 - 00:38:04 (33 sec),"And we're doing it with American aluminum and we're doing it with American steel. And our steel is doing really well. Really well. To put more money in the pockets of Tennessee families, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in the history of our country. And we eliminated the core of Obamacare."
00:38:04 - 00:38:26 (22 sec),"We got rid of the individual mandate. It's gone. The worst part of our (inaudible) And as bad as those premiums are, we've kept the premiums down. We've done a lot of things. But we're trying to keep those premiums from the remnant of Obamacare down. But it will all get taken care of. We just need a few more votes."
00:38:26 - 00:38:53 (27 sec),"This year alone, we have successfully lowered your health insurance premiums in the state of Tennessee by 26 percent. That's not bad. Under the past administration, it was like a rocket ship going up. To help critically ill patients access life-saving treatments, we just passed something they've been trying to pass for 45 years."
00:38:53 - 00:39:18 (25 sec),"Right to try. You know what that is. Right to try. Right? I'm very proud -- Meadows helped with that one. And Phil helped with that one, right, Phil? Phil Roe. You guys all helped with that one. And Greg, right, Greg was good. Did a good job. You know, right to try, so somebody's terminally ill, and we have medicines that have great help, great future."
00:39:18 - 00:39:38 (20 sec),"They look good. They're very promising. But we had no right to give those medicines to somebody that's terminal, is going to die. They had no hope. If they had money, they traveled all over the world to find a cure, but yet we have the greatest doctors and the greatest medicine in the world here. But it would be years, three years, four years."
00:39:38 - 00:40:00 (22 sec),"We've reduced it. It used to be 14, 15 years. I think we have it down to three-and-a-half to four. Scott is doing a great job at the FDA. But... Forty-five years they've been trying to pass -- not as easy as it sounds. Not as easy as -- I will tell you, not that easy, but we got it passed. So now somebody's terminally ill."
00:40:00 - 00:40:24 (25 sec),"And if we have a drug that looks like it's possibly going to help, we can actually give it to those people. And you know what? Already we've had success. Some of these drugs are working. Some of these drugs are working. I'm very proud of it, right to try. Hopefully you don't have to use it, OK? I don't want you to have to use it, but you know what?"
00:40:24 - 00:40:41 (16 sec),"If you do, doesn't it make sense, instead of doing -- I mean, if you don't have the money, you just go home and you sit there and it's -- you lose hope, and if you do have money, you go all over the world trying to find a cure. So right to try, remember it. That was a big deal. We also passed veterans choice."
00:40:41 - 00:41:11 (30 sec),"Any veterans in the room? Yes. We do. Young veteran. Young. We just passed choice. That was 44 years they've been trying to pass choice, so that if you have to wait in line for 9 days, 30 days, 21 days, months, you don't do that anymore. If the line's big, and if you're unhappy with it, you go to a private doctor, they take care of you, and we paid the bill."
00:41:11 - 00:41:30 (19 sec),"It's better. And you save a lot of money. It's better. They've been trying to pass that one for many, many decades. They couldn't do it. We got it passed. We're good at passing things, right? We're good. We're good at passing things, right? Oh, look. Come here. Stand up, Phil Roe. Stand up. That's right."
00:41:30 - 00:42:04 (33 sec),"That's right, Phil. Man, no wonder they love you in Tennessee. Great, right? And another one, we just passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act, right? V.A. accountability. This is where you have employees at the V.A., Veterans Administration, who are terrible, who treat our great, great warriors who are troubled."
00:42:04 - 00:42:30 (26 sec),"They're not well. They're sadist. They steal. They rob. They do a lot of bad things, some of them. Some people are incredible. But we now have the right to go after them. We now have the right to fire them. The V.A. Accountability Act is a big thing. And just last week, I signed a record $716 billion funding bill for our military."
00:42:30 - 00:43:18 (48 sec),"And we are giving our troops the biggest pay raise they've had in over a decade. They deserve it. And I just withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal or disaster. And we've recognize the capital of Israel and opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. We've done -- we've done so much, as point after point."
00:43:18 - 00:43:50 (32 sec),"I will not do this to you, but look at this. Page after page after page after page after page. I mean, look at this. Created jobs, 4 million, created manufacturing, 600,000. I mean, you just go point after point -- each one is a major point. I mean, but we're not going to bore you. But nobody's done -- I'll tell you what."
00:43:50 - 00:44:33 (43 sec),"Nobody has done this much in their first two years or probably in any two years -- nobody has done what we as a -- not me, what we have done with the help of all of these people and all of those people. Nobody. True. Nobody has done what we've done. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:44:33 - 00:44:56 (22 sec),"And we've cut more regulations than any administration, whether it's two years, four years, eight years, 12 years, in one case. We have cut more than any president, any administration, in two years, and it's less than two years, we have cut more regulations. And yet we have crystal clean water. We have pure, beautiful air."
00:44:56 - 00:45:26 (31 sec),"We're into that -- also, folks, but you don't have to turn off all business and send business to foreign countries to get it. Under my administration, we are no longer apologizing for America. We are standing up for America. Standing up. And we're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Tennessee."
00:45:26 - 00:46:07 (41 sec),"And we are standing up very proudly for our flag and our national anthem. We are lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. We're building a future of safety and hope and opportunity. And every city and every community in every part of this great land is prospering like they really have never prospered before."
00:46:07 - 00:46:44 (36 sec),"You see what's happening. It's a beautiful thing to watch. That's why outside right now -- I hope they haven't left -- we put big screens out there for them -- but you have close to 20,000 people standing outside. In the great state of Missouri, you had a big, beautiful arena. I always say Madison Square Garden, less maybe 30 percent, OK? Big, beautiful arena."
00:46:44 - 00:47:08 (24 sec),"It was packed. And in Missouri, they had -- you saw it -- 45,000 people outside. Think of it. So something is happening. And by the way... By the way, Claire McCaskill, who is another disaster, is being soundly beaten, we hope. We hope. Missouri. Audience Member"
00:47:08 - 00:47:47 (40 sec),"Thank you. Thank you, 45,000. So we're fighting for the right of all children to have a safe home, a great school, a loving family and a ladder that raises them up to reach their highest dreams. Wouldn't that be nice? We're unleashing the power of faith. We need more faith in this country. The might of justice and the glory of freedom is what we're about."
00:47:47 - 00:48:15 (28 sec),"But to continue this incredible momentum, momentum like -- I don't know if you've ever had this in this country -- you know, I haven't been corrected. I said the 2016 election may have been the greatest election of all time. There's never been anything like this. And we had to fight the Democrats, but more difficult was fighting a very, very dishonest media."
00:48:15 - 00:48:56 (41 sec),"That was much more difficult. Fighting the media is tougher than fighting the Democrats, but they're equal partners. So you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican and vote for Marsha Blackburn and Bill Lee and all of the great Republicans that are running."
00:48:56 - 00:49:15 (19 sec),"Bill Lee, going to be a great governor. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation -- that's a big factor -- and more products made right here in the good, old USA. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:49:15 - 00:50:05 (50 sec),"Remember the old days we had signs on cars and little decals all over the place? It said made in the USA. Guess what? That's what's happening now. Made in the USA. It's coming back. It's a vote to reduce crime, respect law enforcement, and restore the rule of law. Very simple. It's a vote for strong borders, safe communities, and thriving families, and a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democratic politics of anger, destruction, chaos, and to come together as citizens, as patriots, and as Americans, come together as Americans."
00:50:05 - 00:50:29 (24 sec),"To everyone in this room tonight, to every citizen watching all across the land, and they do have a lot of those cameras rolling, unfortunately -- thank you. It's called -- you know what it's called? Earned media, and I earned it. That I will tell you. Earned media. Thank you very much for the earned media."
00:50:29 - 00:50:54 (25 sec),This is your time to choose. This is your time. It's the time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustration of the past. Look at what we've done. Look at what we've done in far less than two years. Look at what we've done. Nobody believes it. They don't believe it. They don't believe it. And they don't want to report it. So we report it ourselves.
00:50:54 - 00:51:47 (53 sec),"They don't want to report it. By the way, 15 percent of them are OK, 85 percent, no good. And it's also a choice of whether we continue forward into the unlimited promise of our future of this great land, this great country. We were losing our country. I've had so many people come up to me, great people, some of them strong and tough -- and, you know, these aren't emotional people -- they have tears in their eyes, say, Mr. President -- I saw one tonight, came up to me, a man, strong, tough cookie, I wouldn't want to fight him, OK? And he said Mr. President -- he's crying -- he said, thank you for saving our country."
00:51:47 - 00:52:06 (19 sec),"So many people say that. So many people. It is not up to the media to decide our fate. It is not up to the pollsters or the pundits -- although our polls are very good right now. They're going nuts with that one. They don't like it when we have good polls. So usually they make up phony polls, but that's OK. They're called repression."
00:52:06 - 00:52:34 (28 sec),"It's repression. Darling, you know the story. I say it a lot. Darling, I really like Donald Trump, but you know, he can't win because CNN did a poll. Hey, did those polls turn out to be wrong or what? But it's called repression. It's called repression. They're phony polls, just like fake news. They're phony, fake polls."
00:52:34 - 00:52:51 (17 sec),"But they said, darling, I really like that guy, but, you know, the polls say, according to some of the news, the media, because most people think it's legit, although that's changed a very lot. They said, darling, let's go to a movie and then we'll come home and watch our friend, Donald. He'll just -- oh, it's so sad what's happening."
00:52:51 - 00:53:08 (17 sec),"I mean, as an example, I heard, darling, that he's going to lose Texas. I heard that he's going to lose Utah. I heard he's going to lose Georgia. So sad. So sad. Well, you know, when Texas came out at 8 o'clock, they said, ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in Texas and the winner is Donald Trump."
00:53:08 - 00:53:47 (39 sec),"Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the great state of Utah and the winner is Donald Trump. Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the great state of Georgia and the winner is Donald Trump. You see, if it's close, they take hours and hours and days. But when you win a landslide, they do it -- that's when I kept hearing he could be in trouble in Texas."
00:53:47 - 00:54:09 (22 sec),"Yeah, I'd like -- I'd like to have trouble like that all the time. We love Texas. And Ted Cruz is starting to do really well in Texas now. And he is a friend of mine. He's doing really well. He's going to win by a lot. He's going to win by a lot. But we had a -- was that the greatest evening? Tell me. Go back two years, almost two years."
00:54:09 - 00:54:37 (28 sec),"Was that the greatest evening, like, ever? Was that, like, the greatest evening? Remember the board? And, boy, that center, that whole thing -- outside a little blue here, a little blue here -- did you see the red -- the whole thing is red? And by the end of the evening, nice guy, John King, his hand was trembling."
00:54:37 - 00:55:03 (26 sec),"He said, oh, oh, Wisconsin, that's been decades. Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. His hand was shaking. What does this mean? What does this mean? Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan, and you hear the people behind him, oh, no, oh, no, don't. Remember that? Remember Pennsylvania? Pennsylvania hadn't been won for many years by a Republican."
00:55:03 - 00:55:21 (18 sec),"It's a great state, great people. I thought we're going to do well there, I thought we were going to -- but all Republicans think they're going to do well in Pennsylvania and then they lose. So I thought we're going to do great in Pennsylvania. Do you remember? There was 1 percent of the vote left. If we lost every single vote, we win by a lot."
00:55:21 - 00:55:45 (24 sec),"They refused to announce it. They refused. They waited until, like, what time, 1 o'clock in the morning? I said, wait a minute, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot. Announce it. They wouldn't announce it. But they had to announce Wisconsin, Michigan. So nothing mattered. But that was one of the great evenings -- you know, that was one of the greatest rating evenings in the history of television, all because of you."
00:55:45 - 00:56:05 (21 sec),"That was a great evening for all of us. And hopefully, we're going to have another great evening in November and you're going to get Marsha in there, because that's so important, Marsha Blackburn. It's up to you to choose our future. It's up to you to choose prosperity and pride over socialism and decay."
00:56:05 - 00:56:51 (45 sec),"It's up to you on November 6th, right, November 6th, November 6th, 2018, loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We're returning power to the American people. That's what we campaigned on. This great state, the state of Tennessee, was forged through the sweat and sacrifice of tough pioneer men and women, tough people, good genes you have, good genes."
00:56:51 - 00:57:23 (32 sec),"This is the state of Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson, who continues to be on the $20 dollar bill. You know that? Andrew Jackson -- they actually -- you know, they were comparing what we did a year-and-a-half ago -- thank you -- I think it was good what he said -- we were comparing -- they were always comparing it to Ronald Reagan."
00:57:23 - 00:57:42 (18 sec),"Then as we went along, they were going -- then they actually started saying, no, the only one that we compare this one is Andrew Jackson. He had one wild election. And then they say, toward the end, and then with the big victory, they said, no, this was actually greater than even Andrew Jackson. And I'm a big Andrew Jackson fan."
00:57:42 - 00:58:09 (27 sec),"And I went to Andrew Jackson's home in Tennessee. And it was great. And it was special. And he was a tough cookie, and he was a great president, too. This state is the home to generations of proud Americans who defy dangers and brave the elements to defend their families, their country, and always to defend their values."
00:58:09 - 00:58:35 (26 sec),"This is what they do. They defend their values. They defend their families. What else do they defend? They defend our great American flag. Don't they defend that? They defend our flag. Just like the pioneers and patriots who came before us, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win."
00:58:35 - 00:59:16 (41 sec),"We're winning. We're winning. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never, ever back down like these people over here. They'll never back down. Like him. Like him. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory, victory, victory. Because, as you know, we are American."
00:59:16 - 01:00:00 (43 sec),"And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Tennessee. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:56 (57 sec),"Whoa, whoa. [Audience Chants USA] I love Ohio. It's great to be back in Ohio. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. This is a truly great state with thousands of hard-working, wonderful, beautiful American patriots. Beautiful. Under Republican leadership, America is being respected again. And all of those thousands of people that aren't under the shell that is standing out there, look at you."
00:00:56 - 00:01:40 (44 sec),"Look at you. They're getting very wet. Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you. There are thousands of people that can't see a thing. In other words, you're better at real estate than they are, but that's OK. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I'm really proud to report that earlier today we secured the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey."
00:01:40 - 00:02:09 (29 sec),"He is now free from jail and he is in the air, heading to Germany, where he'll get off for a brief check, and I think he's going to be in great shape. And then he's coming to Washington, D.C., tomorrow, and we'll say hello to him. Went through a lot, you know? All about Pastor Brunson. He went through a lot, but he's on his way back."
00:02:09 - 00:02:36 (28 sec),"We've done that with a lot, right? We've had a lot of success. North Korea, Egypt, remember? We bring a lot of people back, and that's good. They want to come back to our country, and they're coming back to our country. Tonight, every American heart is with our fellow citizens affected by Hurricane Michael."
00:02:36 - 00:03:00 (24 sec),"Sounds like a very nice name. That was a vicious hurricane. Whether it's in Florida or Georgia or Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, a lot of areas affected, but we just want to give everybody our love. That was a devastating power that hit -- among the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit our country."
00:03:00 - 00:03:33 (33 sec),"It was devastating. But they'll rebuild. They're strong. They're great people. And just God bless you all. Thank you. My administration has been in constant communication with the state and local authorities all over the various states. When we're in trouble, we pull together, we pull together like nobody."
00:03:33 - 00:04:09 (35 sec),"We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary achievements that we've made together in -- can you believe it -- less than two years? It's been Republican leadership and we are here to make sure that our amazing progress continues full speed ahead. Because America is booming. America is thriving. And America is winning, really winning again."
00:04:09 - 00:04:51 (42 sec),And we are viewing now for the first time in many decades a phenomenon called so simply America first. And it's about time. It's about time. Right? About time. It's about time. The unemployment rate has just fallen to the lowest level in more than 50 years. Manufacturing confidence just announced has reached an all-time high.
00:04:51 - 00:05:33 (43 sec),"Think what that matters. Think what that is, confidence, confidence. The people of Ohio have confidence. Can tell you that. No, but think of it. If you remember the previous administration said manufacturing jobs... Other than that, you like them very much, right? But remember, they said manufacturing jobs, they're gone, they're dead."
00:05:33 - 00:06:02 (29 sec),"Remember the expression, you'd need a magic wand to bring them -- bring them back? We're bringing them back. I guess we have the magic wand. They're coming back. And they're coming back from Mexico, they're coming back from Canada, they're coming back from everywhere, because they all want to be where the action is. They all want to be in the USA."
00:06:02 - 00:06:59 (57 sec),"That's where we want to be. That's where the jobs are. We are now the hottest country anywhere in the world. All across... [Audience Chants USA] By the way, I wish the cameras would get this crowd. This crowd is incredible. Look at the cameras back there. It's like the Academy Awards. Look at this. How would you like to have to do this every night?"
00:06:59 - 00:07:43 (43 sec),"No, no, how would you like to have to do this every night? And one little mistake, one little mistake and they try to destroy your entire career. Boy. No, I mean, look at this. Seriously, look at -- look at the magnitude of it. Look at the number of the media back there. Look at that. Fake news. Fake news."
00:07:43 - 00:08:13 (30 sec),"Fake. You go back and they'll say, did he say -- did he say this? Or that? Or this? That's OK. You know what, we've learned how to live with them. We've learned how to live with them. We don't like it, but we've learned. All across Ohio, steel mills are reopening, and we are putting our coal miners back to work."
00:08:13 - 00:08:40 (27 sec),"One of the things we're most proud of - look, steel was dead. Steel was dead. I came into office, steel was a dead business. Now they're opening up plans, U.S. Steel, Nucor. They're opening up plants all over the country, big ones, new ones. We're taxing the hell out of the dumpers. You know, you had the dumpers that were hurting your steel industry?"
00:08:40 - 00:09:07 (27 sec),"And you know what happens? After the industry dies -- would have died within two years. After it dies, they would come in and they would charge you three times more money. Nobody says it, but that's what happens. So we're going to have beautiful new American-made steel... It's not going to be mud or it's not going to be sand steel."
00:09:07 - 00:09:35 (27 sec),"You know they put garbage in this stuff they were dumping. We don't even know what's in it. It's going to be U.S. steel. It's going to be American steel. We're going to get the iron ore from our mines, right, beautiful. They're opening up again. Our mines are opening up again. Metallurgic coal, but our miners are back to work."
00:09:35 - 00:10:16 (42 sec),"We don't need outsiders telling us about our steel industry. It's incredible. Seriously, it's incredible what's happened. It's hot as a pistol. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation, which is what we want. And this has been... [Audience Chants USA] So this has been a really historic week for America."
00:10:16 - 00:10:53 (37 sec),"Really historic. And by the way, our magnificent first lady, Melania... just returned from an incredibly successful trip to Africa. It was an incredible trip. And she came back, and she told me so beautiful, so beautiful, and yet such incredible in some cases poverty. They need help. They definitely need help."
00:10:53 - 00:11:21 (28 sec),"It's both beautiful and sad. It's got every kind of emotion. But you probably saw her travels. They were really incredible. And it opens your eyes to what's going on around the world. You're all very lucky in Ohio. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. Thank you. And on Monday night in the East Room of the White House, we achieved a tremendous victory for our nation, our freedom, and our Constitution."
00:11:21 - 00:12:09 (48 sec),"America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Did he get treated badly and unfairly or what? Horrible. And I'll tell you what. He's done us a tremendous service, what -- the way they treated him, I've never seen anybody treated like that."
00:12:09 - 00:12:38 (29 sec),"But he's done us a great service, because we are more energized as Republicans that ever -- I think ever before. I think ever before. We just got poll numbers for some of the Senate races. And you look at some of these Senate races where we weren't even going to contest. It's a Democrat that's in. We were figuring in -- you know, we're winning with candidates that are -- we're winning."
00:12:38 - 00:13:22 (44 sec),"We're beating people that we weren't going to contest. So it's been amazing. Because people realize how important the Supreme Court is. And we could have two, three, maybe even four more choices, and we have to be able to get the votes to put them through. Go out and vote November 6th. From the moment Brett Kavanaugh was announced, an angry Democrat mob was on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy him."
00:13:22 - 00:13:51 (29 sec),"And before they even know -- I'll tell you, you saw it. Before they knew his name, they were saying horrible things. They didn't even know who was going to be the pick. He wasn't picked. I didn't know who was going to be the pick. And they were saying horrible, horrible things. These are bad people. We can't let this happen to our country."
00:13:51 - 00:14:24 (33 sec),"Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob. That's what it is. It's a mob. The people of Ohio can save America from radical Democrats. They've become radicalized. I mean, Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, seriously... No, no, seriously, she's becoming mainstream. You believe that one? We have to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate."
00:14:24 - 00:14:58 (34 sec),"We need the votes. We need the votes. And, by the way, for the people of Ohio, early voting starts right now. You got to get out. Vote early. And then anybody that votes early, you can leave. The hell with you. That's -- you know, I worked in Cincinnati, Ohio, two summers. I loved Ohio. I loved Ohio. I shouldn't tell you this, but I used to travel a lot to Kentucky."
00:14:58 - 00:15:36 (38 sec),"Does anybody travel to Kentucky? Right? No, I -- I like Kentucky. But I traveled to Kentucky when I spent a lot of time in the Queen City. I love the Queen City. We had a job, Swifton Village, Swifton. Does anyone ever hear of Swifton? And it was a great experience. It was a successful experience. I did it with my father, one of my earliest things that I've done, and I guess it's sort of like if you get your first up as a hit, you're a hitter, you hit, you sink the 10-foot putt on the first hole."
00:15:36 - 00:16:10 (34 sec),"But we had a great success in Ohio, and I've never forgotten it. And then they said -- remember, for months before the election, you cannot win without getting the great state of Ohio. Right? And I got the great state of Ohio. And I love the great state of Ohio. We got it. We got it. Remember? They used to say that every time."
00:16:10 - 00:16:36 (26 sec),"I used to hear it. I have fantastic people in Ohio that did a job for me. Bob Paduchik, where's Bob? I had just a great group of people. They did incredible work. But they constantly would say on these phony networks, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio. And then they started doing polls, and I was way up. And I think we won it by 9 or 10 points."
00:16:36 - 00:17:12 (36 sec),"A lot. We won it by a lot. In fact, you know the way, if it's close, they have to take hours and hours and hours, right? So with Ohio, I'll never forget, they said the polls have closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. Crazy. We won Ohio by so much that it took one second before they called it, OK? We won by a lot."
00:17:12 - 00:17:46 (34 sec),"It's a great place. And by the way, have I produced? Look at what's coming into Ohio now. Have we produced? I produced and you produced. If Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats... take control, they will try to raise your taxes, impose socialism on this country, take away your health care, and take away your jobs."
00:17:46 - 00:18:13 (27 sec),"We have more people working now than ever before. They want to take away -- that's what will happen. The Democrats want to erase America's borders and let drugs, gangs and crime pour into our country. In fact, I've been going around lately saying the Democrats are the party of crime. And nobody even challenges me, not even the fake news media."
00:18:13 - 00:18:48 (35 sec),"They don't even challenge me. Republicans are the party of safety and Republicans are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. And that's what's happened. And we're honored to be joined tonight by many terrific Ohio Republicans, including Republican Party Chair -- I have to say, this woman is incredible, because, you know, I got dropped just before the election by the head of the Republican Party."
00:18:48 - 00:19:31 (42 sec),"I've never been dropped in my life. And a woman came in who is a very successful person with a great family. And she took that thing over. What a job she's done. Her name is Jane Timken, and she is very special. Where's Jane? She's incredible. Thank you very much. And a man who said, oh, you're going to win, you're going to win, and I said, well, how do you know?"
00:19:31 - 00:19:56 (26 sec),"So I had five people to choose from to head up my campaign in Ohio. And one name, I don't know, I liked the name, I liked the sound of it, his name was Bob Paduchik. Why do I like that name? Why? It's not outstanding. But he came in and he did a job, and I had the support of the people, but not the support of a lot of others."
00:19:56 - 00:20:16 (20 sec),"And he just said, you're going to win. And every time I called him up and say, you know, this happened, that happened, he said, that's OK, you're going to win by more. This guy's the most positive guy. So I want to thank Bob Paduchik. So good that we moved him over to the RNC, but, Bob, in about a year from now, get ready."
00:20:16 - 00:20:50 (34 sec),"You're coming back here. Thank you, Bob. And we have a friend of mine who's an incredibly respected man in the United States Senate. When he speaks, we all listen, including the president. He really is. He's a great, great guy. He's loved in Ohio. Senator Rob Portman. Where is he? Thank you. He's a respected guy."
00:20:50 - 00:21:15 (25 sec),"Thank you, Rob. Congressman Warren Davidson and Congressman Brad Wenstrup, thank you. Thank you, fellas. Great job. So many things we passed in Congress. Those two guys were there with us. Thank you very much. What a job they've done. We're also joined by your next lieutenant governor Jon Husted. Jon, thank you."
00:21:15 - 00:22:01 (46 sec),"Thank you, Jon. And I hear you're up a little bit, Jon. We've got to get that over, because you're going against a very bad guy. I'll tell you, he's a bad guy. And everybody -- I'll tell you, Jon is with a friend of mine, and they decided to get together, which is very smart. Instead of going like this to each other, they got together, and Jon is running with your next governor, Mike DeWine... And Mike and Jon are running against Elizabeth Warren's far-left disciple, Richard Cordray."
00:22:01 - 00:22:33 (32 sec),"Jon, am I allowed to say some bad things about Cordray? Because let me tell you, he did such a bad job at the agency that he ran. It was terrible. He was hurting people. And I think he enjoyed it. No, really. I really believe he enjoyed it. He was putting people out of business. They weren't loaning money to the people that they were supposed to. It was terrible."
00:22:33 - 00:23:09 (36 sec),"Cordray spent $250 million federal dollars trying to renovate a headquarters, his agency, that they didn't even own, more than twice what the entire building was worth. They didn't own it. And then it became a big scandal. But because it was a Democrat, the fake news didn't want to write about it. Then after spending like $50 million on some elevators, it turned out that they didn't work."
00:23:09 - 00:23:30 (22 sec),"If Cordray were ever -- and I'll tell you what, this is a Pocahontas dream to get this guy elected. [Audience Laughs] I can't believe -- you know, I know Ohio pretty well, right? I've done a lot for the steel industry. More than anybody's done in many, many -- I mean, you speak to U.S. Steel, they'll tell you."
00:23:30 - 00:23:57 (27 sec),"A lot for the miners, a lot for everybody. This guy does not belong in the state, folks. OK? First of all, he's a super liberal. Why do you do that? Why do you do that -- is he -- OK, go with DeWine, please. And Jon. Cordray would be an absolute disaster for Ohio. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing."
00:23:57 - 00:24:36 (39 sec),"I couldn't wait to get him out. We tried so hard. You know, you had one of these deals that you couldn't get him out. But we tried so hard. And they've done such a great job since we got him out. He was bad. You don't need him in Ohio. Now, I'm thrilled to introduce the next United States senator from Ohio, Jim Renacci, who's a great guy and a great friend of mine."
00:24:36 - 00:24:47 (11 sec),"Jim, come up. Come up. Come. This is a good man. Nothing's easy about politics, but I'll tell you what, he's in there fighting, and just get out and vote for him. He is a good, good friend of mine and a good man."
00:24:47 - 00:25:27 (40 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. It's an honor to stand here with you tonight, like I stood with you 31 months ago when you were candidate Trump, and I told you I am with you. I told you I voted for you. I told you my wife voted for you, my family voted for you, my friends voted for you. Because we needed you to change Washington, and you haven't let me down."
00:25:27 - 00:26:13 (47 sec),"Look, this crowd loves you. Ohio loves you. And we love what you're doing! You've got the Ohio economy growing. Unemployment is down. Wages are up. The tax cut and jobs bill is working in Ohio. You have two Supreme Court judges confirmed and more circuit judges confirmed than any other president. You've repealed the individual mandate that was hurting so many individuals here in Ohio, renegotiated NAFTA, helping Ohio business, passed right to try."
00:26:13 - 00:27:06 (53 sec),"ISIS is on the run. And you have given our coal miners here in Ohio hope by reversing those devastating policies of the prior administration that had vowed to bankrupt that industry. Promises kept -- promises made, promises kept. Look, Mr. President, we are not tired of winning here in Ohio. And yet you've been able to do all that with no help from Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown."
00:27:06 - 00:27:39 (33 sec),"He has fought you every turn, voting against the tax bill, voting against coal miners, voting against your judges' confirmations. You asked for help, and that's why I jumped in this race seven months ago. And I am here to help, just like Ohio, everyone here is here to help. Sherrod Brown votes 96 percent of the time with Chuck Schumer and 94 percent of the time with Elizabeth Warren."
00:27:39 - 00:28:35 (56 sec),"Yet he voted 100 percent of the time with President Obama's judge appointments. He supported Hillary Clinton for president. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up] And -- and even though -- and even though you are ripping up those trade agreements that aren't working for Ohio, Senator Brown had the gall just a month ago to say the only thing President Trump has done for trade policy is run his mouth and line his pockets."
00:28:35 - 00:29:09 (34 sec),"That's the type of guy who is not helping this president. Sherrod Brown is the fourth most liberal senator in the country. That's not Ohio. That's not even close to the average American. He votes like a Hollywood liberal, and he has received the most lobbyist money in the Senate, more than any other senator, he has received the most lobbyist dollars."
00:29:09 - 00:29:54 (45 sec),"Look, it's time we send Sherrod Brown packing. And it's time we send me to Washington. Someone that's willing to help this president... [Audience Chants Drain the Swamp] In 25 days... In 25 days, in just 25 days, we need to retire Sherrod Brown. We need a red wave. We need a red -- not only a red wave -- and I said this earlier."
00:29:54 - 00:30:08 (14 sec),"Mr. President, Ohio is going to deliver a red tsunami. Thank you for what you're doing, Mr. President. And thank you for what you've done for Ohio. Thank you."
00:30:08 - 00:30:41 (32 sec),"Thank you. Thanks, Jim. It is true. Sherrod Brown's never voting for us. He didn't vote for anything that we want. Yet I hear he goes around -- he does the best commercials. In fact, I just want to think, is he a Republican? He's doing these commercials that he likes Donald Trump. He'll never vote for us. He didn't vote for Justice Kavanaugh."
00:30:41 - 00:31:36 (55 sec),"He didn't vote for tax cuts. He doesn't vote for us, folks. I mean, it might be nice for him to say he agrees with my economic policy when he's never going to vote for it. So you're just kidding yourself. He voted yes on amnesty for illegal aliens. He voted yes on deadly sanctuary cities. We started building the wall, and we've made progress, but he voted against it. [Audience Chants Build the Wall] So illegal immigration takes American lives, American jobs, and American taxpayer dollars."
00:31:36 - 00:32:02 (26 sec),"A border wall, which is moving faster than anybody would believe... is truly a life-saving barrier against deadly floods of drugs, crime, smugglers, traffickers, cartels. Our brave border agents want a wall. They need a wall. It's happening. It's moving. We have made so much progress. We will finish the wall."
00:32:02 - 00:32:39 (37 sec),"If you want more jobs and less crime, if you want to stop Schumer from running the Senate... we need the vote of Jim Renacci. We do. Jim is a good person. He's a great guy. We need his vote! You know they say we have a majority. But if somebody has a cold, they can't come in, we don't have a majority anymore."
00:32:39 - 00:33:00 (21 sec),"We got to get people. We've got to get some Republicans so we can vote. Finally, it's my privilege to introduce a tremendous Ohio Republican. We're here for him tonight. A great friend of mine, he's fought so hard for everything we've done. He's a true fighter for the state, Congressman Steve Chabot. Great guy."
00:33:00 - 00:33:00 (1 sec),"Come up, Steve. Come up, Steve."
00:33:00 - 00:33:58 (57 sec),"Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President. And God bless Warren County! All right, yeah, all right. And God bless Hamilton County, too. I have Hamilton County. And Butler County, as well, and the Kentuckians. Oh, God bless you all. And God bless President Trump! Thank you. And I never knew I'd say this."
00:33:58 - 00:34:26 (28 sec),"But God bless Kanye West! Hey, you know -- you know how many liberals it takes to screw in a light bulb? None, because they'd prefer to stay in the dark, so... [Audience Laughs] Let me just -- let me just say, I got like a -- I got about a six-page speech here. I decided the more Steve Chabot you get, the less President Trump you're going to get, so I'm not going to give this speech."
00:34:26 - 00:34:43 (17 sec),"God bless you all, and God bless the President Trump!"
00:34:43 - 00:35:19 (37 sec),"Thank you, Steve. So just remember, a vote for Steve Chabot is a vote to protect your family, your jobs, and your country. Now, Steve's winning. Nice poll numbers. But don't take any chances. Get out and vote, please, OK? No chances. We don't want to hear about any upsets. He's a great, great guy. If you want to stop the radical Democrats, if you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker -- can you believe it -- and you have to get out and vote for Steve."
00:35:19 - 00:35:56 (37 sec),"Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats have signed up for a socialist takeover of American health care that would utterly destroy Medicare and Rob our seniors of the benefits they paid into their entire lives. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and they've paid for it. And the Democrats want radical socialism, and they want open borders where everybody pours into our country."
00:35:56 - 00:36:25 (29 sec),"It's what they want. I don't get it, but that's what they want. Does anybody want that? Open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. Think of that. I'll tell you what, the incredible men and women of ICE are not treated properly. They're not treated properly. They do an incredible job."
00:36:25 - 00:36:59 (34 sec),"The Democrats want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens, MS-13 killers, and anybody else that wants to come in. We're not going to have it. We're not going to have it. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. This election is about safety and is about prosperity."
00:36:59 - 00:37:24 (25 sec),"Since the election, which is incredible. If I would have said this, I've been to Ohio so many times, been to every part of Ohio. The people are great. But if I would have said this, the fake news would have said, how dare he say that. Since the election, we've created over 4.2 million new jobs... and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps."
00:37:24 - 00:37:58 (33 sec),"Big deal. That's a big deal. We've added nearly 600,000 brand-new beautiful manufacturing jobs. Right? African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in the history of our country. And African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever, lowest rate ever. My -- that's a big number, right?"
00:37:58 - 00:38:24 (26 sec),"How do they beat that number? How does anybody beat that number? We're going to have these people come in. For over 100 years, they've claimed and they've wanted and they've said -- they've lied to African-Americans. Remember my statement, what do you have to lose? Guess what? They all believe it now. What do you have to lose?"
00:38:24 - 00:38:52 (28 sec),"They're doing -- we are doing great as a country. But I'm so proud -- I am so proud of the kind of numbers you're hearing. My administration is fighting every day to deliver safety, opportunity, and justice for everybody, for everybody. We're asking as an example all African-American voters to honor us with their support this November."
00:38:52 - 00:39:27 (35 sec),"Get away from the Democrats. Get away from the Democrats. They've done nothing. They've done nothing. Think of it. We have the best numbers in history on employment and unemployment and median income and many other things. And I think we're going to get the African-American vote. And it's true. Kanye West, what he did was pretty amazing yesterday."
00:39:27 - 00:40:04 (37 sec),"Pretty amazing. And you know who else was with him? A guy you know well, big Jim Brown. Big Jim. What do you think Big Jim would be making today in the NFL? He was unstoppable, right? Unstoppable Jim Brown. He was a great football player and is an even greater man. He's great. Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans likewise have the lowest unemployment in the history of our country."
00:40:04 - 00:40:50 (46 sec),"And women unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is soon to be changed to historic levels, but right now, I'm sorry, it's the lowest in 65 years, OK? Sorry! Sorry, women! I let the women down. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning, right? Tired of winning. Last week, I announced that we are replacing the horrendous NAFTA -- NAFTA was a disaster, folks -- NAFTA was a disaster -- with the incredible, brand-new, U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, the USMCA."
00:40:50 - 00:41:27 (37 sec),"It's opening up Canada, opening up Mexico for our farmers, our -- everybody. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's unfair trade actions and trade abuses. And thanks to our tariff, and especially on steel that's been dumped all over this country, the Ohio steel industry and the U.S. steel industry is roaring back to life and soon will be hitting its most successful years ever."
00:41:27 - 00:41:59 (32 sec),"Very serious. And you see it. You see it all over this state. Under Republican leadership, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. And by the way, Sherrod Brown voted against them. We reduced high-dose opioid prescriptions by 16 percent during my first year and now they're dropping much lower than that."
00:41:59 - 00:42:57 (57 sec),"And I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress -- thanks to Rob Portman and a lot of others -- thank you, Rob -- but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support. We also passed veterans' choice, the V.A. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor and the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans, who we couldn't fire, we couldn't do anything about it, we now look at them and say, Jim, you're fired."
00:42:57 - 00:43:42 (45 sec),"Out. Get out. True. True. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion for the second year to fully rebuild the American military, which had to happen. We needed it. And much less importantly, when it comes to the military, every bit of equipment is being built in the USA. That's the only place where jobs are secondary."
00:43:42 - 00:44:15 (33 sec),"Number one, we needed the equipment. But it's all being built here. We make the greatest military equipment in the world. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force. Very important. Very important. That's very important. Hate to say it, but very soon, that's where it's going to be at. It's going to be space, everything, defense, offense, everything."
00:44:15 - 00:44:41 (26 sec),"And we have tremendous support from Rob and the Senate. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal, and look what happened to Iran. You know, when I took office, Iran was all over the place. They were taking over Syria. They were taking over Yemen. They were taking over everything."
00:44:41 - 00:45:07 (26 sec),"I actually said, this is going to be a problem, and we've got to do something. And about four months ago, we withdrew from that horrible, ridiculous deal. And you take a look what's happening to Iran. There's riots all over the streets, all over the cities. It's a whole different ballgame. It's a whole different country."
00:45:07 - 00:45:52 (45 sec),"And it's looking real good. Looking real good. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and reopened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together, we've made unbelievable progress, and we're just getting started. We have so many other things. If you vote to elect Republican House, Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes very, very substantially."
00:45:52 - 00:46:43 (51 sec),"We will protect Medicare and we will protect your Social Security. The Democrats cannot do it. We will continue to confirm judges who interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass case law, crack down on sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery and chain migration, defend the ballot box for American citizens, and throw vicious MS-13 gangs the hell out of our country, like we're doing right now."
00:46:43 - 00:47:04 (21 sec),"You know, I say it to people, MS-13 gang, vicious, horrible people. We're throwing them out of here by the thousands. But you know who's doing it? Do we love law enforcement or what? But you know who's... But ICE, in Long Island, where I sort of grew up -- I was right next to these areas. I know them so well."
00:47:04 - 00:47:27 (22 sec),"You had towns that were practically taken over by MS-13. And ICE goes in like it's a day in the office. And they're tougher and smarter that these wise guys. And they start throwing them in the paddy wagon, throwing them in, get the hell out of here. And you know what? The towns are liberated. The people are clapping from windows."
00:47:27 - 00:47:55 (28 sec),"The people are clapping all over the streets. These towns, like a country that was invaded and taken over and then was liberated. These towns are being liberated of the MS-13 garbage that came into our country. Under the previous administration, by the way. And they came in by the tens of thousands -- well, we have set every record on getting them out."
00:47:55 - 00:48:20 (25 sec),"And I want to tell you, there's nothing that gives me more pleasure. And for all of the companies that are moving back in to the United States, we will finally have a merit-based system of immigration. Not just lump -- not a lottery, pick them out of a hat. Who the hell are they? Who is he? Pick them out of a hat."
00:48:20 - 00:48:40 (20 sec),"We're letting people come in on merit, where they can help you, where they can help these companies grow. Right now, we have a system, lottery, a lottery. Think of it, lottery. Oh, pick 'em, I wonder? What people do you think these countries are putting in? Do you think they're putting in their finest? I don't think so. I don't think so. So we're going to end it. We're going to have a merit-based system."
00:48:40 - 00:49:02 (22 sec),"Bring them in through merit. We're lifting millions of people from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. And you see that happening. But to achieve this, you have to get out November 6th or vote early and vote Republican. We need the votes. We have to have those votes. For years and years, you've watched as your leaders apologized for America."
00:49:02 - 00:49:23 (21 sec),"They apologized for America. Now you finally have a president who is standing up for America. [Audience Chants USA] I have to tell you, I wish these fakers back there, the fake news, I wish they'd turn the cameras and show behind them, show outside these walls. Look at the people out there. It's amazing."
00:49:23 - 00:50:48 (84 sec),"Look, they never turn the cameras. I go home, I say to my wife, how did the crowd look? They only show your face. They never move the camera. But you know what? She can tell by the sound, because... True. She can tell by the sound, because, you know, if you have, like, let's say, one of the normal presidents walk in. We've had a lot of normals."
00:50:48 - 00:51:22 (35 sec),"And some great ones. You'd have, what, 300 people show up. But you can tell by the sound, because 300 people cannot make the sound of thousands and thousands and tens of thousands like that. They can't do it. So even though they refuse -- you know, normally I'd like it, but I don't. They don't want to move the camera."
00:51:22 - 00:51:43 (21 sec),"The only ones that become famous are about six people right behind me. [Audience Laughs] They don't have the best seat in the house, but they're going to become the famous ones. No, but, honestly, you know, I know what stadiums sound like, and this sounds like on television we're in the middle of an Ohio State football game."
00:51:43 - 00:52:42 (59 sec),"It's what it sounds like. It's what it sounds like. And speaking of Ohio State -- they're not doing too badly, are they, huh? Great coach. You have a great coach, great guy. Great guy. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Ohio. And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. But to continue our momentum, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and vote Republican, vote early or on November 6th, vote Republican."
00:52:42 - 00:53:18 (35 sec),"Vote for Steve Chabot, Jim Renacci. Vote for DeWine. We need DeWine. We got to have DeWine. Where the hell is Jon? Are you over there, Jon? He's still here. He'll never leave. You got to vote. We need a governor here -- you cannot let this happen to Ohio. This Democrat is a disaster. A proven disaster. Vote DeWine."
00:53:18 - 00:53:48 (30 sec),"He's a good man, and a good man, too. You've got two good men. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, more products made right now in the USA, which is what we're all about. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement."
00:53:48 - 00:54:17 (29 sec),"Thank you, law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division. You've seen that. You just saw it with a high-quality, highest quality, this incredible man. You saw it. Brett Kavanaugh, you saw it, what they did to him and his family. And his young, beautiful daughters."
00:54:17 - 00:55:00 (43 sec),"Right? Da Nang Dick, Da Nang Dick, how about Da Nang? Da Nang Dick. Cory Booker, he ran Newark into the ground. Senator Dianne Feinstein, how about that? How about that? Seriously. [Audience Chants Lock her up] Who think that Dianne Feinstein leaked the papers? Who thinks... She was very unprepared for that question."
00:55:00 - 00:55:35 (36 sec),"No, I didn't -- she was very unprepared, right? Very unprepared. Dianne Feinstein. You know, what they did to this man, he will go down along with Justice Gorsuch -- and, by the way, how good is Clarence Thomas? How good? How good? He's going to go down as one of your greats. It's up to the people in this incredible -- I don't know if you call it a room."
00:55:35 - 00:56:05 (30 sec),"I don't know what the hell it is. All I know -- is this a room or a roof? I think it's a roof. Whatever it is, there are a lot of people. But it's up to you, folks. You have the power with your vote to defend your family, your country, your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity. So we had the greatest movement in the history of our country."
00:56:05 - 00:56:35 (30 sec),"We really did. We really did. You know, they can say what they want, but nobody even challenges it. You know, I'll say that a lot. And usually, if there's, like, a 2 percent variation, the fake news will hit me the next day. Trump exaggerated or something. Actually, we've under-exaggerated, because we've produced more than I ever promised during the campaign."
00:56:35 - 00:56:57 (21 sec),"More. But we had the greatest -- but look at the -- look at this. Look at this group. We had the greatest -- and we never -- by the way, I hate to disappoint you, but we went to Mississippi, we went to Missouri, we went to Nevada, we went to -- every place, and we have crowds, we have tens of thousands of people outside of every arena."
00:56:57 - 00:57:19 (22 sec),"They have to start building larger arenas in this country, right? Something is happening. And I saw this in the election. We'd go -- I'll never forget -- we went to Michigan, final stop. I got there 1 o'clock in the morning. There was actually Election Day, 1 o'clock in the morning. There were 32,000 people."
00:57:19 - 00:57:45 (26 sec),"I see some people there, they were there. It was unbelievable, 32,000 people. I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning. I got home at 4 o'clock in the morning. And I said, you know, we had 32,000. Crooked Hillary had, like, 500. And I said, why aren't we going to win the great state of Michigan? And guess what?"
00:57:45 - 00:58:18 (33 sec),"We did. We did. And it hadn't been won in decades by a Republican. And now they like me even more. You know why? Because car companies are moving plants back in. And just so you don't feel too lonely, they're moving the plants back into Ohio also. A lot of them. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country."
00:58:18 - 00:58:57 (39 sec),"And together we are taking back our country. We're returning the power back to the incredible American people. Ohio is the state that gave us a great president who hasn't been properly recognized, OK? William McKinley has not been properly recognized. What he did in terms of trade, in terms of war, but in terms of trade -- and I hate to say, in terms of being smart in tariffs, William McKinley has not been properly recognized."
00:58:57 - 00:59:27 (30 sec),"But maybe someday he will. It also gave you a general, who was incredible. He drank a little bit too much. You know who I'm talking about, right? So Robert E. Lee was a great general. And Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia. He couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. He was going crazy. I don't know if you know this story."
00:59:27 - 00:59:48 (21 sec),"But Robert E. Lee was winning battle after battle after battle. And Abraham Lincoln came home, he said, I can't beat Robert E. Lee. And he had all of these generals. They look great. They were the top of their class at West Point. They were the greatest people. There was only one problem. They didn't how the hell to win."
00:59:48 - 01:00:14 (27 sec),"They didn't know how to fight. They didn't know how. And one day, it was looking really bad. And Lincoln just said, you -- hardly knew his name -- and they said, don't take him. He's got a drinking problem. And Lincoln said, I don't care what problem he has, you guys aren't winning. And his name was Grant."
01:00:14 - 01:00:51 (37 sec),"General Grant. And he went in and he knocked the hell out of everyone. And you know the story. They said to Lincoln, you can't use him anymore. He's an alcoholic. And Lincoln said, I don't care if he's an alcoholic. Frankly, give me six or seven more just like him. He started to win. Grant really did. He had a serious problem."
01:00:51 - 01:01:13 (22 sec),"Serious drinking problem. But, man, was he a good general. And he's finally being recognized as a great general. But Lincoln had almost developed a phobia, because he was having a hard time with a true great fighter and a great general, Robert E. Lee. But Grant figured it out, and Grant is a great general, and Grant came from right here."
01:01:13 - 01:01:46 (33 sec),"Ulysses S. Grant. Ohio is the state that gave us the Wright Brothers. It gave us Neil Armstrong. He's the man that planted the flag -- think of that -- on the face of the moon. Who's that? Who are they -- a relative of -- oh, that's nice. They weren't worried about not planting a flag, right? You know them."
01:01:46 - 01:02:38 (51 sec),"He planted that flag, that American flag right on the face of the moon. There was no kneeling. There was no nothing. There was no games. There was no games. Boom. Wrong, right? Right, fellas? My military guys up here. Of course, my -- excuse me. Excuse me. My military folks all over this arena. And how do you like the fact that the V.A. now has choice, right?"
01:02:38 - 01:03:02 (24 sec),"I said it. But, you know, I skip over it. For 44 years, they've been trying to get choice, and we got it done. That means instead of waiting for 10 days or 5 days or 22 days or 33 days, or 2 months, our great veterans, some of them would be fine, just not feeling so good by the time they saw the doctor. It took so long, they would have a terminal illness."
01:03:02 - 01:03:31 (29 sec),"That's how bad it was. And I got done what they'd been trying to do for 44 years, I think. Forty-four years. Now when they have to wait, they go out, they get the services of a good private doctor, we pay the bill, and they're all better, and that's nice. Forty-four years. It took 44 years to get that done."
01:03:31 - 01:03:56 (25 sec),"I'm just saying that because I see these great military guys. That's pretty much appreciated, fellas, right? That's a big difference. It's a big difference. Made a lot of people very happy. Probably cost us less money. I don't care about that in this case. I care about taking care of our veterans. It's about time."
01:03:56 - 01:04:41 (45 sec),"Generations of Ohio workers farm the fields, poured the incredible steel, fought the battles that made America into the most powerful and prosperous nation in the history of the world. We lost our way. But now we've gained our way back again, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. These courageous Ohio patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage."
01:04:41 - 01:05:14 (33 sec),"We didn't do that. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. That's all we're going to do is win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down."
01:05:14 - 01:05:43 (28 sec),"We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
01:05:43 - 01:06:13 (30 sec),"And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:23 (24 sec),Please. Thank you very much. You can sit. [Laughter] It's great to be with you. And I want to thank Chief Dekmar for that wonderful introduction and for your lifetime of distinguished service. A very special friend of mine.
00:00:23 - 00:00:52 (29 sec),"I'm thrilled to be here in the great state of Florida, with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. On behalf of all Americans, I want to express our eternal gratitude for what you do every single day to protect our families, defend our streets, and take down criminals. And what you do is keep America safe, and nobody does it better than you. Thank you very much. Thank you."
00:00:52 - 00:01:12 (20 sec),"And I also want to thank your amazing families. Because you know that, without them, you couldn't do it. And they're here. And they are indeed fantastic people. So thank you to the families. Appreciate it very much."
00:01:12 - 00:01:43 (31 sec),"We are thrilled to be joined today by a true friend of law enforcement, Governor Rick Scott. And I will tell you that Rick has been incredible when it comes to law enforcement. Anytime you need funds from the federal government, he's on the phone. ""Mr. President, we need more funds."" ""What's it for this time, Rick?"" [Laughter] ""It's for law enforcement."" And I say, ""You got them."""
00:01:43 - 00:01:57 (14 sec),"And speaking of that -- oh, you got them. You got them. When law enforcement wants it -- and they always -- they're reasonable. They want it. And what you do is so incredible."
00:01:57 - 00:02:04 (8 sec),"So I just want to say, Rick is a tremendous governor, and he is your biggest fan. So thank you very much."
00:02:04 - 00:02:19 (15 sec),"And also, another one of your big fans, I will tell you that, is Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is with us today. And thank you, Pam. Thank you very much, wherever you may be. She's in this big room someplace. Thank you. Incredible woman."
00:02:19 - 00:02:40 (21 sec),"Thank you as well to our Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for being here. Flew down together. The press wants to know, ""What did you talk about?"" [Laughter] But we had a very good talk, I will say it. That became a very big story, actually, folks. [Laughter] We had a good talk."
00:02:40 - 00:03:18 (37 sec),"As Hurricane Michael nears landfall, we are working with state and local officials in Florida to take all necessary precautions. And we urge all residents to be prepared and to heed local officials. I told Rick Scott that we are ready for you. We have already briefed FEMA, and FEMA is getting prepared. And it looks like a big one. Can you believe it? It looks like another big one. But we've handled them well. We have handled them very well. And that includes the one that just left us in Florida. It never ends."
00:03:18 - 00:03:31 (14 sec),"But we're all prepared, and hopefully it won't be as bad as it's looking. It looked, to me -- looked, a couple of days ago, like it was not going to be much. And now, it's looking like it could be a very big one. So we're prepared. And good luck."
00:03:31 - 00:03:55 (23 sec),"Today, I also want to extend my very special thanks to Orlando Chief John Mina and the entire Orlando Police Department for hosting us in this great city. John. Where is John? Thank you, John. Great job. Great city. Safe city, too, John. Thank you very much. Great job."
00:03:55 - 00:04:26 (32 sec),"I also want to thank the board of IACP, and congratulations to your incoming President, Chief Paul Cell. Where is Chief? Chief. Good, Chief. I have a lot of respect for the Chief; I know the Chief. That means I guess I have to be here next year, Chief. Is that right? [Laughter] Looking like that, right? That's okay. For you guys, anything I can do, I'll do."
00:04:26 - 00:04:54 (28 sec),"Very importantly -- I want to recognize our law enforcement partners from around the world who have traveled here to share their experiences and to strengthen the vital cooperation that we all practice together. We have great, great cooperation all over the world. We deeply value your friendship and your partnership, and thank you very much for being here. Thank you."
00:04:54 - 00:05:11 (16 sec),"This year, we proudly celebrate the 125th anniversary of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. It's a great group."
00:05:11 - 00:05:35 (25 sec),"Today, I stand before you, as the President of the United States, to tell you that my administration will always honor, cherish, and support the men and women in blue. And we are proud to do it."
00:05:35 - 00:05:48 (13 sec),"Working together, we have achieved extraordinary progress in the fight against violent crime. We understand that reducing crime begins with respecting law enforcement."
00:05:48 - 00:06:01 (13 sec),"For too many years, we have watched politicians escalate political attacks on our courageous police officers. And I've never seen it more than over the last few years. It's disgraceful."
00:06:01 - 00:06:29 (28 sec),"Politicians who spread this dangerous anti-police sentiment make life easier for criminals and more dangerous for law-abiding citizens. And they also make it more dangerous for police. And it must stop, and it must stop now."
00:06:29 - 00:07:07 (39 sec),"Before I took office less than two years ago, our nation was experiencing a historic surge in violent crime. In 2015, 2016, an additional 128,000 violent crimes were committed nationwide compared to the two previous years. That's a tremendous number of additional crime. Over the same period, we witnessed the steepest two-year consecutive increase in murders in nearly half a century."
00:07:07 - 00:07:32 (24 sec),"But we are turning that tide around very rapidly, as you all know in this room. We are taking back our streets from drug lords, gangs, and crimes. We are being tough. We're being smart. By the end of this year, murders in major cities are estimated to drop by close to 10 percent from their levels in 2016."
00:07:32 - 00:07:53 (21 sec),And I have directed the Attorney General's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave. We want to straighten it out. We want to straighten it out fast. There's no reason for what's going on there.
00:07:53 - 00:08:21 (29 sec),"I've told them to work with local authorities to try to change the terrible deal the city of Chicago entered into with ACLU, which ties law enforcement's hands; and to strongly consider stop-and-frisk. It works, and it was meant for problems like Chicago. It was meant for it. Stop-and-frisk."
00:08:21 - 00:08:47 (25 sec),"And Rudy Giuliani, when he was mayor of New York City, had a very strong program of stop-and-frisk. And it went from an unacceptably dangerous city to one of the safest cities in the country -- and, I think, the safest big city in the country. So it works. It's got to be properly applied, but stop-and-frisk works."
00:08:47 - 00:09:20 (34 sec),"The crime spree is a terrible blight on that city, and we'll do everything possible to get it done. I know the law enforcement people in Chicago, and I know how good they are. They could solve the problem if they were simply allowed to do their job and do their job properly. And that's what they want to do. So, Chicago, we're going to start working with you, as of today. Thank you."
00:09:20 - 00:09:32 (11 sec),"In the Fiscal Year 2018, my administration brought charges against more federal firearm defendants and more violent criminals than ever before in the history of our country."
00:09:32 - 00:09:43 (11 sec),"And to help former inmates become law-abiding and productive members of society, we are also working on a prison reform bill -- a very, very big and comprehensive one."
00:09:43 - 00:10:02 (18 sec),"And the best thing that could happen, I think we've already done: We have record numbers of jobs right now in the United States. There has never been a time when more people are working in our country than right now."
00:10:02 - 00:10:21 (20 sec),And our unemployment numbers in almost every category are at record lows. They are record lows. African American -- best in history. Asian American -- best in history. Hispanic American -- best in history. We are doing incredibly well as a -- as an economy.
00:10:21 - 00:10:40 (19 sec),"And that's a great thing when you talk about people coming out of prison -- unable to get a job, totally unable to get a job; it's a hopeless situation. Now, they're getting jobs -- to a certain extent and to a large extent because we're doing so well, and employers are forced to take people that they maybe wouldn't have done."
00:10:40 - 00:11:02 (21 sec),"And some of those employers call me and get back to me. And they say, ""Mr. President, it's amazing how good these people are."" And not all of them -- not all of anybody or any category is going to be great. But tremendous response. And these people have been given a second or even, in some cases, a third shot at it. And they're doing really well."
00:11:02 - 00:11:22 (20 sec),"So the economy being so great, and the jobs picture being so strong -- people are getting an opportunity, and they're doing an incredible job. So I just want to thank everybody in law enforcement. I know you agree with me on this. It's a great thing."
00:11:22 - 00:11:36 (14 sec),"And in particular, I have to thank the IACP for working with us on this effort and for endorsing important prison reform legislation all over the country. And we're doing federal legislation, but all over the country. You folks have been fantastic."
00:11:36 - 00:12:01 (25 sec),"Every single day of my administration, we will stand for law, order, and justice. Just two days ago, the Senate confirmed a supremely qualified nominee who will be a faithful defender of the rule of law -- and will defend the United States Constitution -- the newest Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh."
00:12:01 - 00:12:37 (35 sec),"And I will tell you, when I decided on Brett -- and we have tremendous talent in our legal system. But I decided on Brett. I said, ""He's flawless. He's a flawless person."" The best student. The best scholar. The great intellect. Incredible record over many years. And yet, he's a young man."
00:12:37 - 00:13:06 (29 sec),"I said, ""Brett, congratulations. This is going to be a piece of cake getting you confirmed."" [Laughter] ""This is going to be so easy. It should go quickly, nicely. Don't even worry."" He was so thankful. [Laughter] He said, ""Mr. President, it's the greatest honor of my life -- United States Supreme Court. The greatest of my life."""
00:13:06 - 00:13:37 (31 sec),"So I haven't heard him say that again to me, but I think he still believes it. [Laughter] But he's a great person, and it was very, very unfair what happened to him -- false charges, false accusations, horrible statements that were totally untrue that he knew nothing about. Frankly, terms that he probably never heard in his life. He was this. He was that. He'd never even heard of these terms. It was a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evil."
00:13:37 - 00:14:11 (34 sec),"And he toughed it out. We all toughed it out together. And I have to thank the Republican senators that fought so hard for this because it wasn't easy. And it was a great honor to be involved in this situation. A lot of people would have said, ""Oh, let's give it up. Let's go a different direction."" We don't give up. You don't give up. We don't give up. Just don't do it. He's going to be a great Supreme Court justice -- watch. A great one. He will be a great one."
00:14:11 - 00:14:30 (19 sec),"We will perform the swearing-in tonight at 7 p.m., at the White House. That's very exciting. So I leave here, and I go home, and I swear in a man who will be a truly great United States Supreme Court Justice. That's going to be my honor. Thank you."
00:14:30 - 00:14:58 (28 sec),"And I'm going to tell him about the spontaneous applause. Before I even finished -- you people. [Laughter] Because you knew what I was about to say, but I didn't even say it. And you started before I completed. So that's the kind of -- all over the country, I'm doing rallies, and people are loving that man and loving that choice. So I think we're all going to be very happy."
00:14:58 - 00:15:24 (26 sec),"In order to keep every American safe, we are also making officer safety a top priority. In 2016, an officer was assaulted in America on an average of every 9 minutes. Is this even believable?"
00:15:24 - 00:16:00 (36 sec),"Last week, seven officers were shot in Florence, South Carolina -- incredible state. One was killed; numerous were really badly injured. Our hearts break for the family of fallen Officer Terrence Carraway. We pray for his loved ones and for the officers who are still recovering. When a police officer is assaulted or killed, it is a wound inflicted upon our entire nation. It is."
00:16:00 - 00:16:43 (43 sec),"And I have to say this, I don't think you understand one thing: how much our country loves you and the job you do. You don't hear it from them. You don't hear it from them. They don't tell you the real feeling. They don't tell you the true feeling, but I know the true feeling. I know the true feeling. You don't hear it from the media, but I can tell you, I know the feeling. And these people -- the people of our country love you. So I just want you to know it direct."
00:16:43 - 00:16:44 (1 sec),"We love you, Trump!"
00:16:44 - 00:16:56 (12 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I love him, too. He's just not my type, I'm sorry. [Laughter] He's not my type. Thank you."
00:16:56 - 00:17:09 (14 sec),One of my very first actions as President was to direct my administration to take all necessary action to protect law enforcement from acts of violence against all of you.
00:17:09 - 00:17:25 (16 sec),"We believe that criminals who kill our police officers should immediately, with trial -- but rapidly as possible; not 15 years later, 20 years later -- get the death penalty."
00:17:25 - 00:18:22 (57 sec),"And importantly, we are also making sure you have the equipment you need to do the job. That's why we are allowing local police to access surplus military equipment. And we've been doing this since the very first day of my administration, whereas others didn't want you to have that equipment for very strange reasons. [Laughter] They said it looked too tough, it looked too strong; it's not a good look. You have people shooting at you, and they're worried about your look. [Laughter] Someday you'll explain that one to me, please. I don't quite get it. Explain it."
00:18:22 - 00:18:43 (21 sec),"This equipment doesn't only protect your lives and safety, it protects the lives and safety of every citizen that you serve. During Hurricane Harvey, surplus military equipment helped rescue more than 9,000 people."
00:18:43 - 00:18:59 (17 sec),"We are also taking unprecedented action to help our local police fight the worst drug epidemic in our history -- the opioid crisis -- which took nearly 50,000 American lives last year."
00:18:59 - 00:19:15 (16 sec),"We have secured the most funding in history to give you the tools and resources that you need to hunt down the traffickers, stop these poisonous drugs from coming into our country, and to save American lives."
00:19:15 - 00:19:42 (27 sec),"In fact, today I'm announcing another $42.4 million for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program to attack this epidemic. This grant funding will go to more than 50 innovative projects targeting the greatest drug threats facing the United States."
00:19:42 - 00:20:00 (18 sec),"And I will tell you that, last year in the budget -- this year also -- last year, we got $6 billion -- $6 billion -- to work on the opioid problem at every level, including people -- really helping people that are in need of help."
00:20:00 - 00:20:17 (17 sec),"Last year, we increased the average federal sentence for drug trafficking to its highest level since 2013. For the first time in years, we are ensuring there are real, tough consequences for those who flood our streets with deadly poison."
00:20:17 - 00:20:42 (25 sec),"Thanks to your partnership, last year, our brave ICE agents seized 1 million pounds of narcotics, including almost 7,000 pounds of heroin and more than 2,300 pounds of fentanyl -- saving thousands upon thousands of American lives. And this year, we're way ahead of those numbers."
00:20:42 - 00:21:09 (27 sec),"Last year alone, ICE removed nearly 130,000 criminal aliens from our country. And, as you know, my competitors don't like that. They don't like that. That's the other thing you're going to have to explain to me someday. Including thousands of vicious gang members and MS-13 predators. They're gone. They're gone."
00:21:09 - 00:21:50 (41 sec),"Yet, these brave ICE officers have been subjected to shameless attacks by leading members of the Democrat Party, including outrageous calls to abolish ICE. And also, they're not a big help to us in law enforcement. They don't want to give us the kind of funds that you people are requesting. But you're getting them anyway because we're giving them to you. But they fight us at every turn. The Democrats fight us at every single turn. Whether it's law enforcement or military, they fight us at every turn. But we win."
00:21:50 - 00:22:04 (14 sec),"We condemn the vilification of law enforcement and law enforcement officers, and we stand proudly with the heroes of ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement in general."
00:22:04 - 00:22:29 (25 sec),"We also strongly oppose efforts from politicians to shackle local police departments and prevent them from cooperating with their federal partners. So let's see whether or not Chicago -- as an example, locally -- accepts help. They need it. And we'll straighten it out fast. We're going to straighten it out fast."
00:22:29 - 00:22:37 (8 sec),"I assume they want to straighten it out. Sometimes I think, ""Maybe is it possible that they don't?"" But we're going to be there. We're going to try and help them."
00:22:37 - 00:22:54 (17 sec),"Every day, these sanctuary city policies force the release of criminal aliens and gang members right back onto our streets, putting innocent civilians at grave risk -- many people being killed."
00:22:54 - 00:23:22 (28 sec),"I will fight every day for your right to cooperate with federal law enforcement and to protect your communities as you wish. And I know most of you in this room -- I think probably everybody in this room -- works brilliantly with our federal authorities. And it's our honor to do it -- including funding, by the way -- including funding. Thank you."
00:23:22 - 00:23:56 (34 sec),"Last week, my administration also provided historic levels of funding to improve school safety. Through STOP School Violence grants, we are giving local schools and police departments the resources they need to hire more officers, and train more teachers, and better detect and address early warning signs of mental illness before it's too late. I made a lot of strides in the last year. Heavy funding -- but you've made a lot of strides."
00:23:56 - 00:24:11 (15 sec),"In every action we take, we are defending American safety and treasuring the extraordinary -- I mean, we're just helping as much as we can the extraordinary men and women who protect our communities."
00:24:11 - 00:24:22 (11 sec),Here with us today are all four nominees for the IACP Police Officer of the Year Award.
00:24:22 - 00:25:06 (44 sec),"Officer Taylor Rust serves with the Plano, Texas Police Department. Good place. Where's Taylor? Taylor. Where's Taylor? Come on up here, Taylor. Run up here. They'll let you up. Come on up. We'll get all of them up. Come on."
00:25:06 - 00:25:17 (11 sec),"A year ago, Taylor raced to the scene of an active shooter in a neighborhood, entered the house without any backup at all, and shot and killed the murderer -- it turned out to be somebody with a lot of bad past -- saving the lives of four civilians."
00:25:17 - 00:25:40 (23 sec),"Officer Rust, we salute you and your remarkable courage. You are a great gentleman. Stay up here with me, okay? Say -- come on, say couple of words."
00:25:40 - 00:25:48 (8 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. You'll have to forgive me, I'm much more comfortable in the situation Mr. President described than being up here. [Laughter]"
00:25:48 - 00:25:59 (11 sec),"It's a tremendous honor for me to be here. I appreciate everything IACP has done for us, my family. My wife, Amber, is here. She's been a tremendous support, as well, through this whole thing."
00:25:59 - 00:26:14 (15 sec),"It's been a very humbling experience for me, and it's been an honor to be spoken in the same breath with the other three officers that are sitting over there today. Thank you very much."
00:26:14 - 00:26:29 (15 sec),"That was a good job. He'll be running for office soon. You watch. [Laughter] Thank you very much, Taylor."
00:26:29 - 00:26:51 (22 sec),"Last May, Officer Mark Dallas was on duty at Dixon High School, in Illinois, when he heard gunshots. Within -- listen to this -- three seconds, he was at the scene, right outside the auditorium where the entire senior class was gathered and was in a lot of trouble."
00:26:51 - 00:27:22 (31 sec),"The shooter fled and fired shots at him, but Officer Dallas chased him down before a single student was injured. Officer Dallas's son Joshua was one of the seniors inside that auditorium. Afterwards, Joshua said, ""I wasn't scared for my life at all because I knew my dad would protect us."" How good is that?"
00:27:22 - 00:27:32 (10 sec),"Thank you, Officer Dallas. Where are you? Officer Dallas, come on up here. That's pretty good. That's pretty good."
00:27:32 - 00:27:44 (13 sec),So his son had a little confidence in him. That's not bad. That's beautiful. Beautiful.
00:27:44 - 00:27:58 (14 sec),"Public speaking is not my best, but I'm -- I'm extremely nervous. [Laughter] Mr. President, I appreciate everything, and the support you give us. And I'm honored to be here with the IACP and the other nominees."
00:27:58 - 00:28:05 (7 sec),"My son said he wasn't scared because dad was out there. I was ""dad"" to 182 other kids in that gymnasium."
00:28:05 - 00:28:18 (13 sec),I just want to say thank you. I'm honored and blessed to be here. Thank you.
00:28:18 - 00:28:28 (10 sec),Beautiful story. Thank you very much. That's a beautiful story. And your son was right.
00:28:28 - 00:29:01 (33 sec),"In October of last year, Washington State Trooper Nathaniel Dawson pursued a car that violated a traffic law. When the car stopped, two gunmen began shooting at Trooper Dawson, and shooting very violently. Despite heavy fire, Trooper Dawson got out of his vehicle and fired back until the shooters ran away and were later apprehended. They were very dangerous criminals."
00:29:01 - 00:29:12 (10 sec),"Our streets are safer, and our criminals recoil in fear because of brave officers like Trooper Dawson. And I want to thank you. Come up, please, Trooper Dawson."
00:29:12 - 00:29:38 (26 sec),Wow. It's a great honor to be here tonight. Thank you all for coming -- Mr. President. I think we all would say the same: We're just doing our job. And to be recognized is just extra. So thank you again.
00:29:38 - 00:30:00 (22 sec),"Thank you very much. Thank you. These people have a lot of respect for you. They don't sit down when you're up here. [Laughter] They have a lot of respect, right? That's great. Beautiful."
00:30:00 - 00:30:29 (29 sec),"Finally, Sergeant Luis Celis of the Doral -- I know it well -- Florida Police Department -- they are fantastic -- responded to the call that you all read about -- a big story at the time -- that a shooter was in the lobby of Trump National Doral. Can you believe this is happening to me? And I didn't say, ""Put this manâ¦"" I knew what he did. But they put him. Threatening a lot of people that were in the hotel, including the employees."
00:30:29 - 00:30:50 (21 sec),"Sergeant Celis entered the building, engaged in a vicious shooting attack, and captured the criminal before anyone was hurt -- which was incredible, actually."
00:30:50 - 00:31:12 (22 sec),"Sergeant Celis, that was really a job well done. People are still talking about it. It was an amazing job. Please come up."
00:31:12 - 00:31:23 (12 sec),I guess he's a tough act to follow -- [Laughter] -- what the guy said over here.
00:31:23 - 00:31:40 (16 sec),"Thanks everybody for being here. My wife, Olga. And congratulations to everybody else. Thank you."
00:31:40 - 00:31:51 (11 sec),"And just to conclude, I have to say, in each of these stories we see the unmatched strength, and character, and courage of our amazing heroes in blue."
00:31:51 - 00:32:15 (24 sec),"Every day, our police officers race into darkened allies and deserted streets, and onto the doorsteps of the most hardened criminals -- people you don't want to be dealing with. And you deal with them well. Incredible. They see the worst of humanity, and they respond with the best of the American spirit."
00:32:15 - 00:32:38 (23 sec),"America's police officers have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. In moments of danger and despair, you are the reason we never lose hope -- because there are men and women in uniform who face down evil and stand for all that's good and just and decent and right."
00:32:38 - 00:32:56 (18 sec),"No matter what threat you face, you never give in. You never back down. You are people of tremendous courage and strength. We appreciate it. Appreciate it."
00:32:56 - 00:33:11 (15 sec),Nothing can break your spirit or bend your will -- I've seen it over many years -- because you are the proud men and women of law enforcement.
00:33:11 - 00:33:23 (11 sec),"We thank you. We salute you. We honor you. And we promise you: We will always have your back. Now and forever, we will have your back."
00:33:23 - 00:33:51 (28 sec),"So it's my great honor to be with you today, and I thank you and I thank everyone in this incredible room of heroes -- the International Association of Chiefs of Police. You have very, very special, very smart, very brave, brave people."
00:33:51 - 00:34:06 (15 sec),And on behalf of our incredible country -- our country that's getting stronger and bigger and richer and just better -- we're making it greater. [Laughter] And that's okay. It's greater. We're making it greater.
00:34:06 - 00:34:21 (15 sec),"I want to say God bless you, God bless your families, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:15 (16 sec),"Thank you, folks. I've paid you so much money over the years. David, I've given them so much money. That's all right. And you did a good job. Please."
00:00:15 - 00:00:25 (10 sec),"As a memento for us of him being here, we have created him a hardhat with the Presidential Seal, the American flag, NECA, and our convention logo. You could use this in Washington from time to time. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:00:25 - 00:01:04 (39 sec),"I will use it. I will. That's beautiful. Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you. I don't want to put it on because I'm afraid that I'll mess up my hair. That would be terrible. [Laughter] Did I have a good hair day? Or -- I don't know. Yes? Come on. [Laughter] Got to do it. Thank you, man. Is it still okay? I think so."
00:01:04 - 00:01:19 (15 sec),"Thank you, everybody. Please sit down. And it is true -- I told David, ""David, I paid these guys so much money over the years, built so many beautiful buildings."" And you know what? The job you do is incredible."
00:01:19 - 00:01:38 (19 sec),"I'd go to some of those switchboards and I'd go to some of those connectors, and I said, ""These are smart people. Putting that together, these are smart..."" -- and you are, you're smart people and you're talented people. Few people could do what you do, that I can tell you. So, thank you. Thank you. That's true."
00:01:38 - 00:01:58 (21 sec),"And thank you, David. I'm thrilled to be in the great city of Philadelphia. I went to college here at the Wharton School of Finance -- U of Penn -- with thousands of our nation's most skilled and talented workers -- the electrical contractors who make our country run. So true."
00:01:58 - 00:02:19 (21 sec),"I also know from firsthand experience, America's electrical contractors are the best in the world. Nobody even close. And now -- that's true. Nobody close. And now, you have a friend and an ally in the White House. And you do. You have a friend."
00:02:19 - 00:02:56 (37 sec),"I want to thank John Grau, Dan Walter, Mark Mazur -- well, that's a very interesting name, Greg Rick. Where -- who's Greg Rick? Where's Greg? [Laughter] Stand up. I love that name. ""Greg Rick."" They have a lot of problem back-and-forth, I'll bet, huh? Over your life, huh? [Laughter] They call you ""Rick""; they call you ""Greg."" [Laughter] And he's a good man. And the incredible leadership team at the National Electrical Contractors Association. You have great leadership."
00:02:56 - 00:03:06 (10 sec),"With your help, we will protect this noble trade for many generations to come. And you're protecting it yourself with your talent."
00:03:06 - 00:03:28 (22 sec),I also want to thank a very special group of people who always get the job done and get it done right -- the proud members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Thank you very much. Thank you.
00:03:28 - 00:03:38 (9 sec),"And speaking of energy, we are honored to be joined by Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- where's Rick? He's around here. Stand up, Rick. Great job he's doing. Doing a great job."
00:03:38 - 00:04:02 (25 sec),"And Alex Acosta, as you know, Secretary of Labor. Alex. Thank you, Alex. He just developed two incredible healthcare plans that really work and they're really popular. Thank you very much, Alex."
00:04:02 - 00:04:24 (21 sec),"As well as two tremendous leaders from Pennsylvania, Congressmen G.T. Thompson and the great Lou Barletta -- going to be your next senator I hope. Thank you. Thank you, G.T. Thank you, G.T. And thank you, Lou. What a job you're doing."
00:04:24 - 00:04:37 (13 sec),"I'll tell you what, if he's your next senator, you're going to have no more problems. He is a doer. So, I'm very proud of you, man. Great job. And I hear you're doing well, and I'm proud."
00:04:37 - 00:04:46 (9 sec),"Also here with us are members of the Mississippi congressional delegation. In fact, I'm going there with the delegation. I'll be there tonight."
00:04:46 - 00:04:59 (13 sec),"People say, ""Where do you get this energy?"" You know where I get it? I love doing it, actually. If you love doing it, it's easy. Right, David? If you don't like doing it, not so good."
00:04:59 - 00:05:30 (31 sec),"Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith -- where's Cindy? Cindy. Thank you, Cindy. I hear you're doing really well. A man who always does well, Senator Roger Wicker. Roger. Been a great friend of mine from the beginning. Thank you, Roger. And Representative Gregg Harper. Thanks, Gregg. Thank you, Gregg."
00:05:30 - 00:05:44 (14 sec),"This is really an incredible time for our nation. We are respected again. We are respected again, like we haven't been respected in many, many decades."
00:05:44 - 00:06:17 (33 sec),"We have the best economy in our history. Stock market today just hit another record high. That's the hundred -- I think its 103 times since I'm President that we've hit a new high. And hopefully, next year at this time we'll hit many more. But that's not a bad number, right? I think we're up to 103. And if I'm off just by a little bit -â like if it's 102 -- it'll be headlines. ""Trump exaggerated."" [Laughter] That's why I always say ""I think it's around..."""
00:06:17 - 00:06:29 (12 sec),"With a Republican Congress, we've added more than 4 million new jobs since Election Day, and lifted 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Those are tremendous numbers."
00:06:29 - 00:07:00 (32 sec),"Jobless claims are at a 50-year low. And the stock market, as I just said, is at an all-time high today. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have all recently achieved their lowest levels ever recorded. That's pretty good."
00:07:00 - 00:07:24 (23 sec),"That's a very hard soundbite to beat, right, if you're the opponent of Trump? When you say ""highest and best numbers we've ever had."" And we have created over 50,000 new jobs in electrical contracting. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Nobody thought that was going to be happening. And it's going way up. It's going up very fast."
00:07:24 - 00:07:44 (21 sec),America's â- and just remember this â- America's economic revival would not be possible without the men and women in this room. Would not be possible. I've built so much. I've done so much business with you. I've watched the things you've done and it's incredible.
00:07:44 - 00:08:06 (21 sec),"We are truly grateful to our electricians, our wiremen, linemen, engineers, technicians, journeymen, contractors, and apprentices â- oh, I love that word. That was a great -- I love the word ""apprentice."" I love that word."
00:08:06 - 00:08:16 (10 sec),"You know, I did that show 14 seasons, and then I left. They wanted to sign me for three more seasons. I said, ""No, I'm going to run for President."" [Laughter] It's true."
00:08:16 - 00:08:28 (12 sec),"So they replaced me with a big, big movie star. And it didn't last too well. It was gone like â- quickly. But I love that name. ""The Apprentice."""
00:08:28 - 00:08:53 (24 sec),"Who keep the engine of American prosperity running full speed ahead. We're also fixing decades of disastrous trade deals that have plundered our factories and stolen our wealth and our jobs. What's happened here over the last 20, 25 years, and more is horrible."
00:08:53 - 00:09:11 (18 sec),"But we're changing it all. We've added 400,000 new manufacturing jobs since the election. And that number, very shortly, will be up, David, to 640,000. Big things are happening currently."
00:09:11 - 00:09:25 (14 sec),"And if you remember, the past administration said those are jobs that you're not going to be adding. ""You're going to need a magic wand."" Do you remember that? Magic wand. There was no magic wand; it's good policy and other things."
00:09:25 - 00:09:37 (13 sec),We are in the midst of a manufacturing renaissance â- something which nobody thought you'd hear â- which means more jobs for our great electrical contractors.
00:09:37 - 00:10:05 (27 sec),"Yesterday, we made history by announcing an incredible, brand new trade deal to replace the horrible NAFTA deal that drained our country of jobs and companies. As I have said many times -- NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made in any country at any time."
00:10:05 - 00:10:19 (14 sec),And now we have a great trade deal. And we have deal that is also good for Mexico and good for Canada. And we have a good partnership with the three. And it worked out. It all worked out.
00:10:19 - 00:10:33 (15 sec),"As you probably noticed, and read, and saw, there were a little tough negotiations. But you know what? It all worked out. And we're now on the right track. And we did a great deal with South Korea. It's all working out."
00:10:33 - 00:10:52 (19 sec),"Now, as you probably have heard, we're looking at China and other countries, and we're straightening out some of these horrible deals that stole our wealth, stole our jobs, stole so much from us. Actually, in many ways, stole our dignity as a country."
00:10:52 - 00:11:33 (40 sec),"Our landmark new trade agreement is called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Like YMCA; or United States Marine Corps, with an ""A"" at the end. [Laughter] I liked the way it sounded. I didn't want to use the name ""NAFTA,"" because NAFTA has been so bad for us. I would watch 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago -- you look at New England where the factories were devastated. People forget. People forget. You still have empty buildings all over the country from NAFTA, so I didn't want to use the name ""NAFTA."""
00:11:33 - 00:11:54 (21 sec),"â USMCA is the most advanced, modern, and balanced trade agreement ever negotiated. It is also the largest trade deal the United States has ever made. And we think it's the largest trade deal ever made in the world -- $1.2 trillion in commerce a year."
00:11:54 - 00:12:30 (36 sec),"The USMCA will protect American workers, substantially increase exports of American agriculture. Our farmers are so happy. I spoke with Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa this morning. She was so happy. And the farmers and agricultural people are thrilled. They didn't know if we'd ever be able to make a deal or certainly a fair deal for them. They're thrilled. And this deal will revitalize, also, the American auto industry."
00:12:30 - 00:13:02 (32 sec),"One thing I wanted was, I don't want any incentives to get companies to leave our country; fire everybody; move to Mexico, or Canada, or someplace, and build cars and send them in -- no tax, no nothing; and, in the meantime, we end up with nothing except unemployed people. Not going to happen anymore. That's what I wanted in this deal. It was so important. It was so important."
00:13:02 - 00:13:16 (14 sec),"Do you remember those days? You all remember those days? When everybody was leaving the country? Going to make a product, send it in, and we end up with unemployed. That's about all we got out of it -- no nothing. So those days are over, folks."
00:13:16 - 00:13:39 (23 sec),"Last week, I also stood beside President Moon and announced a new trade deal with South Korea that will increase exports of American-made cars very, very substantially; increase exports of agriculture; and also medicine, which is very big and very important business."
00:13:39 - 00:13:53 (14 sec),"We're preparing to start negotiations, right now, with Japan. And we have taken the toughest-ever actions in our history against China's very abusive trading policies and trade practices."
00:13:53 - 00:14:17 (24 sec),"China has been taking out of our country $500 billion a year and it was time to stop. Nobody ever did it. It's crazy. Nobody ever did it -- $500 billion a year. And we're going to have a great relationship with China, but we have to be fair to ourselves, also."
00:14:17 - 00:14:38 (21 sec),"After years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, and we are doing it with -- American aluminum, American steel, and with our great electrical contractors. It's true. But we're rebuilding our country. Yep."
00:14:38 - 00:14:56 (18 sec),We're committed to revitalizing our infrastructure and strengthening our electrical grid. It's so important.
00:14:56 - 00:15:30 (34 sec),"Last week, I proudly signed legislation to completely rebuild the United States military. We're purchasing the finest equipment on Earth, and it will be all made right here in the USA. We make the best equipment in the world. We make the greatest military equipment in the world -- greatest missiles, greatest rockets, greatest planes, best rifles, best ships. We make the best military equipment, by far, in the world."
00:15:30 - 00:15:50 (20 sec),"And it's made also -- much less importantly, in this case, David -- but it's also made with American jobs, which is very good. Normally jobs is number one. When it comes to military, we'll put jobs at number two. We need the equipment, right? Probably seldom so much as these times."
00:15:50 - 00:16:14 (24 sec),"And interestingly -- I hope we never have to use it -- but you know what assures that, or at least almost assures that? Having the most powerful military, by far, that we've ever had means we'l probably never have to use it. It's very simple. We learned that -- we learned that a long time ago, right? We learned that a long time ago."
00:16:14 - 00:16:48 (34 sec),"Another critical element of national security is energy security. And, Rick Perry, you're doing a great job. I'm proud of you. Very proud of you. He was the governor of Texas for 12 years. He was not only a great governor; he was a great cheerleader. And he ran for President -- he was nasty against me, wasn't he, though? Wow. [Laughter] He was tough. And you're doing great, Rick. We appreciate it very much."
00:16:48 - 00:17:12 (24 sec),We are now the single largest producer of oil and gas anywhere in the world. This was very recent. Took a lot of regulations off. We have plenty left. But we took regulations off which allowed us to do things that we would never have been able to do. Think of it: We're the single-largest producer of energy in the world. Did you ever think you were going to hear that? This all happened very quickly.
00:17:12 - 00:17:32 (20 sec),"We've ended the war on clean, beautiful, Pennsylvenle [Pennsylvania] -- hey -- your clean, beautiful, Pennsylvania coal. Right? It's beautiful. It's clean. What they can do with coal today is incredible. And we have more of it than anybody in the world and we're producing energy-rich Pennsylvania shale."
00:17:32 - 00:18:00 (28 sec),"To get you more contracts and more jobs, we've slashed a record number of regulations. And we've approved immediately -- like first day, first week -- the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipelines. That's 48,000 jobs in one day. Boom, boom. Had to sign something."
00:18:00 - 00:18:21 (21 sec),"Those companies have never had it so good. That was dead. Both of them were dead. And I came along. I think it could've been my first day, Rick. Right? But close. And we signed it -- 48,000 jobs immediately. And better than riding it on top, on the railroads. Better environmentally. You know, they talk about the environment."
00:18:21 - 00:18:38 (17 sec),"And right now, our air is record clean. And our water is crystal clear. And that's what we want. But we don't want stopping jobs. We don't want to do what some people wanted us to do -- mostly, our foreign competitors."
00:18:38 - 00:18:58 (20 sec),"And I've ordered federal agencies to dramatically speed up the federal permitting process so that you can get approvals much more quickly. We have the time down to one half of one half already. It used to take 20 years to get a highway approved; we're close to two years, and I'd like to get it down to one."
00:18:58 - 00:19:16 (18 sec),"And that doesn't mean they're going to approve it. But if they're not going to approve it, somebody doesn't have to give up their entire life going through an approval process only to have a 3 to 2 vote -- ""we're not going to approve it."" So, we're going to be close to one year, from twenty."
00:19:16 - 00:19:48 (32 sec),"My administration has also taken historic action to make healthcare more affordable. Through Association Health Plans -- that's Alex -- we are allowing businesses to band together and to buy much more affordable insurance for their employees, including across state lines -- meaning you have tremendous competition. You have to see these insurance companies. They're going crazy -- sort of like the fake news media. They're going crazy. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:19:48 - 00:19:56 (8 sec),"I used the term last night ""loco"" -- in order to get the business -- meaning you're getting good deals. They're getting great deals."
00:19:56 - 00:20:10 (13 sec),"We opened up short-term, limited-duration plans so that individuals can buy the plan they want and the plan that they need at tremendously reduced costs. We've done great with that."
00:20:10 - 00:20:39 (29 sec),"And we've eliminated much of Obamacare. And most importantly, we've eliminated the individual mandate. It's gone. That was the thing in Obamacare that was just no good, where you paid a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay a fortune to have bad health care. Right? You know, guys are paying thousands of dollars so they don't have to buy healthcare. We've gotten rid of it. Gone. That was a big one."
00:20:39 - 00:21:01 (22 sec),"Thanks to our actions, I am pleased to announce that, for the first time since Obamacare was passed, premiums are not going to go up next year. We have done everything in the book. They are actually going to go down somewhat. And if we weren't here, if you had another administration -- they were going up another 122 percent, 153 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent."
00:21:01 - 00:21:17 (15 sec),"And you look at what we've done, just through management of healthcare, and it's not good stuff but we've keep the premiums down to the lowest number that they've been. So we're very happy with that. A lot of people are very happy with that. Thank you."
00:21:17 - 00:21:55 (39 sec),"And we're strongly protecting your Medicare. We oppose efforts from Democrats to raid Medicare to fund socialism, robbing seniors of their benefits. Medicare belongs to the seniors who have earned it and paid into it for their entire lives. They want to take it away -- the Democrats. And we will always protect Americans with preexisting conditions. That's a major part of what I'm all about."
00:21:55 - 00:22:33 (38 sec),"At the heart of our economic revival are the massive tax cuts passed by Republicans in Congress. We didn't get one Democrat vote. And those tax cuts are one of the reasons the economy is doing so well. But you're talking about a lot of money in the pockets of everybody in this room. A typical family of four earning $75,000, as an example, will see an income tax cut of more than $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half, and, in many cases, much more than that. Big difference."
00:22:33 - 00:22:44 (11 sec),And small businesses can now deduct 20 percent of their business income -- one of the most significant small business tax cuts in the history of our country. Very big cut. Big incentive.
00:22:44 - 00:23:07 (22 sec),"Capital investments are soaring because you can now immediately deduct every penny spent on new equipment. You can do one-year expensing. Nobody thought that was ever going to happen. In fact, I should leave and go back into business maybe. If you would have told me that when I was a private businessman, maybe I wouldn't have run for President."
00:23:07 - 00:23:35 (28 sec),"One-year -- think of it -- one-year expensing. Normally, you write it off over 30, 40 years. One-year expensing. That's an incentive to go out and do what you have to do. And I always said that was going to be one of the most important things in the package. That was a small clause that a lot of people didn't talk about. And I said, ""That's going to be one of the most important."""
00:23:35 - 00:24:12 (37 sec),"And bringing back trillions of dollars from overseas -- money that was going to be spent in other parts of the world. Apple is bringing back $230 billion. They're building plants all over the United States, and a great -- from what I hear, a great campus, they call it. So many things are happening. But billions and billions of dollars is being brought back into our country -- money that could never have been brought back under the old system."
00:24:12 - 00:24:21 (10 sec),"And from now on, small business owners will be spared from the deeply unfair estate tax, also known as the ""death tax."""
00:24:21 - 00:24:40 (19 sec),"So if you have a small business or a farm or something -- and you love your kids -- now, if you don't love your kids, it doesn't help you. [Laughter] Because if your kids don't treat you good, don't leave it to them. Give it to somebody else. [Laughter] So it doesn't help."
00:24:40 - 00:25:11 (31 sec),"But if you love your kids, which probably 82 percent of you do -- according to most [Inaudible] -- [Laughter] -- you can now leave your small business or your beautiful little farm or whatever it is that you're so proud of -- you leave it to your kids, and they don't have to go out to the bank and borrow to pay the tax and end up losing it in a foreclosure. It's such a big thing. A lot of people don't talk about it, but we were able to get it."
00:25:11 - 00:25:22 (11 sec),"So the estate tax -- and the death tax, which is sort of the same thing -- but gone -- essentially gone for small business. So that's great. A very big thing."
00:25:22 - 00:26:04 (42 sec),"One of the millions of small businesses that is thriving thanks to tax cuts is Wilson Construction Company in Canby, Oregon. Stacy Wilson runs the business with her family, and she joins us today. Stacy, please come up and tell us about the incredible growth that you've seen since the institution of our tax cuts. Where is Stacy? Go ahead, Stacy. Come on up. From Oregon."
00:26:04 - 00:26:07 (3 sec),"Thank you, Stacy."
00:26:07 - 00:26:09 (2 sec),Thank you. Wow.
00:26:09 - 00:26:09 (0 sec),[Inaudible]
00:26:09 - 00:26:11 (2 sec),Thank you very much. Wow.
00:26:11 - 00:26:14 (3 sec),I'll put that down.
00:26:14 - 00:26:22 (8 sec),"Thank you. Wow. Truly an honor. Thank you so much, Mr. President."
00:26:22 - 00:26:23 (1 sec),It's my honor.
00:26:23 - 00:26:57 (34 sec),"As Mr. President said, my name is Stacy Wilson. We own an electrical contracting company out of Canby, Oregon. We are a midsize company that is family-owned. My grandfather started the company 65 years ago in Oregon and Washington. And my father, Don Wilson, has really made it what it is today -- a nationwide company that specializes in transmission, distribution, and substation projects nationwide."
00:26:57 - 00:27:43 (45 sec),"We employ about 500 employees. And thanks to Mr. Trump and the tax reforms and the general confidence in the economy, I guess, we have really been able to invest more in our employees and grow our company in the last year. We're investing more in employee wages and benefits and bonuses. We're spending millions on equipment and assets. And, in general, we're just seeing a huge increase in work that is coming out because utilities are spending more to update this aging infrastructure."
00:27:43 - 00:27:44 (2 sec),So thank you very much.
00:27:44 - 00:27:47 (2 sec),"Well, thank you so much."
00:27:47 - 00:28:25 (38 sec),"It's made a huge impact. And -- so we are looking to grow about 20 to 30 percent more in employees just in the next few months. We have a lot of large projects that are starting. And this will make, I think, a big difference in -- really, these incentives that are good for businesses are really important for our employees but also the communities we work in. And we've really been thankful and have seen this since President Trump has been in office."
00:28:25 - 00:28:38 (13 sec),"So, thank you so much for this opportunity and this great acknowledgement. I never thought I would be up here, so thank you. [Laughs]"
00:28:38 - 00:28:39 (2 sec),"Thank you, Stacy."
00:28:39 - 00:28:58 (19 sec),"I see that, you know, Stacy comes up -- no notes, no nothing, nothing to read -- and gives a speech better than the politicians, folks. [Laughter] The politicians, they walk up with papers; everything is scripted. They read it. They stutter. Look at her, she's, like, great."
00:28:58 - 00:29:31 (33 sec),"Okay, now she's famous too, so she'll probably become a governor of Oregon. She'll become a governor, or a senator. Great job. Very impressive. That's very impressive."
00:29:31 - 00:29:48 (17 sec),"Another success story in this world, in this great land of ours, is Arcadia Electric in Ridgewood, New York. That's right where I grew up -- right near where I grew up. Company president Steve Gianotti is with us. And, Steve, could you come up and tell us about that great success that you're experiencing, especially recently? Thank you, Steve."
00:29:48 - 00:29:49 (1 sec),"Good afternoon, everyone."
00:29:49 - 00:30:01 (12 sec),"First, I'd like to thank President Trump for his perseverance in helping us with his fiscal policy, which have enabled my company, Arcadia Electric, to bid on more work, and take on more jobs that we're able to do now because we have more coming that's available to us, more than ever before."
00:30:01 - 00:30:30 (29 sec),"And as a result of that, we have been able to keep our 120 people employed. But next year, we anticipate hiring 25 percent more hardworking union workers, middle-class workforce that will -- bring our company to approximately 150 employees, which we're very proud of. They work hard. They're the safest, hardest, union workers. And their professional abilities is what makes us successful."
00:30:30 - 00:31:02 (33 sec),"And for that I have to, again, thank the President of the United States for his perseverance and for enabling us to get this work and to change the regulatory policies that he's been doing -- that he spoke of earlier. This is all helpful to us. So, President Trump, thank you very much."
00:31:02 - 00:31:04 (2 sec),"Thanks. Thank you, Steve. Great job."
00:31:04 - 00:31:30 (26 sec),"We want to give every citizen the opportunity to achieve their American Dream. That's why we're committed to expanding apprenticeships, and on-the-job-training, and vocational education -- you know, a word that you don't hear that much. I'm bringing it back. Because when I was growing up -- I had so many vocational schools, and you don't hear that anymore."
00:31:30 - 00:31:58 (28 sec),"You hear ""junior college."" You hear all sorts of names, but the vocational is what I understood and that's what I like. And I had people that went to school with me, and, in some cases, they weren't great students. But they could take apart an engine blindfolded, put it back together 15 different ways. They were so much more talented than the ""A"" student. We would have been ""D"" students. And that's what they want to do, and that's what they love, and it's called ""vocational."" So we're bringing that word back a lot."
00:31:58 - 00:32:22 (24 sec),"But you have tremendously talented people that are, frankly, making a tremendous living -- making a lot of money. And we love those people. They're very special, so we're bringing back the word ""vocational."" And we're bringing it back strong."
00:32:22 - 00:32:41 (19 sec),"My administration is making a historic investment in workforce development. We established the National Council on the American Worker, and I recently signed a bill to provide more than $1 billion annually for vocational education."
00:32:41 - 00:33:08 (27 sec),"Employers all across the country are signing our Pledge to America's Workers, expanding job opportunities for more than 4.2 million Americans. And that number is soon going to reach 10 million Americans, including 60,000 Americans who will have access to apprenticeships and on-the-job training thanks to the National Electrical Contractors Association. Thank you, David. Thank you, David."
00:33:08 - 00:33:48 (40 sec),"And one of the countless Americans who has experienced the tremendous benefits of an apprenticeship is Liam Nickelaides -- a proud Air Force veteran, a National Guardsman, and a member of Philadelphia's own Local 98. Liam, please come up. Tell us your great story, please."
00:33:48 - 00:33:52 (4 sec),Yes. How is everybody doing today? [Laughter]
00:33:52 - 00:34:08 (16 sec),"So, as an apprentice, it's a pretty easy schedule. Mondays, you wake up at 4:20 in the morning. Tuesdays, you wake up at the same time, you give a speech in front of a couple thousand people and the President of the United States. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:34:08 - 00:34:08 (0 sec),That's great.
00:34:08 - 00:34:53 (44 sec),"For me, my apprenticeship experience has been a pretty good one. When I went to get a job with Local 98, as a member of the Air Force National Guard, I told them that there'd be a good chance that I'd be deploying pretty often. And I told them that during my interview. And I really thank God for the opportunity that they still gave me to get a job and to train me in their union."
00:34:53 - 00:35:21 (28 sec),"So, I thought that maybe it would be just words that I'd get from Local 98. That, yeah, they support the military, but I didn't really know if I could believe it. But I was able to deploy for three months -- short little deployment. And upon my return, I was able to get pushed right back into the education program with the Local 98. And I'm back working -- upon arrival, back in the United States. And tomorrow, I'm waking up at 4:20, and going back to work again. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:35:21 - 00:35:22 (1 sec),"So, thank you."
00:35:22 - 00:36:11 (49 sec),"Is he a natural? Huh? [Laughter, Applause] Thank you, Liam. Good luck with everything. Wow. That's so great. That's so great. They don't even seem nervous, you know? [Laughter] They come up here -- no notes, no nothing. I think it's great. Thank you very much."
00:36:11 - 00:36:40 (29 sec),"And I want to thank you to everyone here today for your investment in America's future, and for your devotion to the American worker. So important. Hardworking citizens like you who have always been the backbone of our nation will always be the most important factor in our nation. You make it grow, you make it work."
00:36:40 - 00:37:03 (23 sec),"You power our homes, you light up our skylines, and you make the glory of America shine for all the world to see. You take pride in your work, and America takes pride in all of you in this big, beautiful room."
00:37:03 - 00:37:30 (27 sec),"You pour out your hearts to earn a living, you create loving homes for your family, and you teach your children to cherish our values and to cherish our great American flag. Always."
00:37:30 - 00:37:50 (19 sec),"In a house not far from where we are today, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, and forever changed the course of human history. Today, we reaffirm our nation's founding truth: In America, the people govern."
00:37:50 - 00:38:03 (14 sec),"The men and women who go to work each day are not only powering our economy, they are powering our nation and they are powering our freedom."
00:38:03 - 00:38:33 (29 sec),"America will always be a nation of great builders. Because in America, we honor work. We honor grit. We honor craftsmanship. We honor the men and women who turn dreams into reality with their own two, beautiful hands. In America, we honor all of you."
00:38:33 - 00:39:01 (28 sec),"With cable, copper, wire, and steel, you are the ones lighting America's path forward. So important. So important. You may not even understand how important it is, what you do. You are the ones rebuilding this land that we love. You are the ones who are making America greater than ever before."
00:39:01 - 00:39:11 (10 sec),Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
00:00:00 - 00:01:08 (68 sec),"Hello, Iowa. It is great to be back in beautiful Council Bluffs with thousands of hard-working, great, great American patriots. Thank you.  This is truly a historic week for America.  And you know what I'm talking about. Of course, yesterday at the White House, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh."
00:01:08 - 00:01:38 (31 sec),"And today, Justice Kavanaugh took his seat alongside of Justice Gorsuch to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom.  And I want to thank our incredible Republican senators for refusing to back down in the face of the Democrats' shameful campaign of political and personal destruction."
00:01:38 - 00:02:30 (52 sec),"I especially want to thank an Iowa legend, whose backbone and leadership made this great victory possible, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a very tough cookie, Chuck Grassley. Thank you, Chuck.  Thank you. Great man. Great person. From the very first minute Brett Kavanaugh was nominated, radical Democrats were on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy -- they wanted to destroy that man, because they want to destroy me, too, but that's OK.  Me, we understand."
00:02:30 - 00:02:56 (26 sec),"Him, how can you do that? They want to destroy everything. That's all they're good at, resisting. Their whole campaign is to resist. Ours is to create.  What the Democrats did to Brett and his beautiful family is a national embarrassment, a national disgrace. You see what's happening and you see where they're coming from."
00:02:56 - 00:03:26 (30 sec),"You see. Including the phony protestors that got paid...  ... and now they want to protest because they didn't get paid yet, and they want their money.  So now they're going to really protest.  You see, that's a real protest. But in just four weeks, you will have the chance to render your verdict on the Democrats' outrageous conduct."
00:03:26 - 00:03:56 (29 sec),"On November 6th -- and you can do early voting in Iowa. Go. Just vote. Get it over with.  Vote. Go vote. Early voting started today. Right? Today. Early vote. Go do it immediately. Then you don't have to listen to me any more tonight.  In fact, if you did early voting already, go home. Have a good time. Thank you."
00:03:56 - 00:04:47 (51 sec),"We'll let some additional people from outside in, right? Nah, that's not going to happen. Got a lot of people outside. Look at this place. You believe it?  It never changes. Could I ask the cameras to just take a swoop of this room, please? Do you mind? Come on.  They don't like to do that. They don't like to -- they like to keep that camera dead set on me and about six people in the background."
00:04:47 - 00:05:10 (23 sec),"All wearing hats saying ""Make Farmers Great Again.""  And we're doing it. I shouldn't -- we're a little bit early. I shouldn't say it now, but we're going with E15 year round, OK?  I made that promise to you during the campaign. I made that promise to you during the primaries. Remember? I made that promise."
00:05:10 - 00:05:43 (34 sec),"Promises made, promises kept.  Right? On November 6th, you have the chance to stop the radical Democrats by electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate. So, we need the votes.  We have a majority that if one person has a cold, we have to hold the vote. I mean, can you -- we don't have -- it's like we hardly have a majority."
00:05:43 - 00:06:06 (23 sec),"We need votes.  Early voting is now underway. And you know that. You got to get out. Early voting, go out now and vote. Leave here now immediately. Is it still open? Yes, get the hell out of here. Early voting.  And in their lust for power, the Democrats have become totally unhinged. They've gone -- they've gone crazy."
00:06:06 - 00:06:49 (43 sec),"No, they've gone crazy. Now the Democrats -- or as some people would says, the Dims -- the Dims -- who says that? Lou Dobbs, the great Lou Dobbs. He says that, right? Sean Hannity says that. The Dims. Sean Hannity.  Judge Jeanine says that, doesn't she?  Laura -- Laura, how good has Laura been, right?  We got a lot of good people."
00:06:49 - 00:07:21 (32 sec),"Do we like -- do we like Tucker? I like Tucker.  He says that a lot. How about Steve Doocy? How about Ainsley, Brian? We got a lot of great friends.  The Democrats are even talking about doing really bad things now to Justice Kavanaugh. You know what they're talking about? And packing the courts with radical judges to overrule the will of the American people."
00:07:21 - 00:08:00 (39 sec),"It's not going to happen, folks. Not going to happen.  Last week, they're saying we'll impeach him. Impeach him for what? For what?  Besides that, I have to go first, right? Don't I have to go...  Even though we've done nothing wrong, other than create one of the greatest economies in the history of our country...  That will be interesting."
00:08:00 - 00:08:42 (42 sec),"You get impeached for having created the greatest economy in the history of our country. The best job numbers in the history of our country, just about, right? The greatest trade deals, which we've just finished, in the history of our country.  The biggest regulatory cuts by far already in less than two years, bigger than any other president during their entire term or terms...  The biggest tax cuts and reforms -- you got a lot of money back -- in the history of our country."
00:08:42 - 00:09:15 (33 sec),"But the Democrats have become too extreme. And they've become, frankly, too dangerous to govern. They've gone wacko.  They've gone so far left that they consider Pocahontas to be a rational person. No, it's crazy. Elizabeth Warren.  Oh, I hope she runs. I hope she runs. Then we can finally get down to the fact as to whether or not she has Indian blood."
00:09:15 - 00:09:41 (27 sec),"So far, she's not doing too well. Her mother says she has high cheekbones. That's why.  And she's gotten a lot of advantages by falsely claiming what she's claiming. So I hope she's one of the finalists. But I don't want to knock too many of them, because maybe by doing I'll knock them all out early and I'll actually end up somebody that's -- like, that's got some talent."
00:09:41 - 00:10:12 (31 sec),"That wouldn't be good. So we have to be nice and quiet.  I should be really quiet, really, really, quite on the bad ones. On the bad ones.  Like, we won't talk about Cory Booker, who ran Newark into the ground.  We won't talk about Da Nang Dick...  ... who tried to convince people for 15 years that he was a great war hero."
00:10:12 - 00:10:33 (21 sec),"They were going down left. They were going down right.  Right, you know who that is? Blumenthal. He said they were going on my left, they were going down -- he was in Da Nang Province. Except the one problem. It's hard to be there, because he was never in Vietnam, but these are minor details.  And then he gets up. He goes, I demand total honesty and transparency."
00:10:33 - 00:10:50 (18 sec),"I'm saying, what's -- he wants honesty. Great war hero. He's a great hero.  Yeah. Right, how about -- how about Senator Feinstein? That's another beauty.  That's a beauty. Did you leak the documents? Well, what, what? No, I didn't do it. Did we leak? Did we leak?  No. No. No, we didn't -- did you ever see -- no, she goes no. He just said, no, we didn't leak."
00:10:50 - 00:11:52 (62 sec),"[Audience chants Lock her up]  And I think they're talking about Feinstein. Can you believe that? Now, was that the worst body language, honestly? In other words, did she leak it? A hundred percent.  No, no, I don't want to get sued. Ninety-nine percent. See, now I can't get sued. Now I can't get sued.  You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob."
00:11:52 - 00:12:26 (33 sec),"And that's what the Democrats are becoming.  They would turn our country so fast into Venezuelan -- and Venezuelan is not doing too well, folks. If you want to drain the swamp, you must defeat the Democrats, so you're going to have one hell of a swamp.  Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving."
00:12:26 - 00:12:52 (26 sec),"And America is winning again like never before, because we are finally putting America first.  The national unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent. You believe that one?  3.7 percent, the lowest in 50 years, five-oh, 50. And it's going better. It's going better. Iowa's unemployment rate is 2.5 percent, among the lowest in its history that we can find."
00:12:52 - 00:13:01 (9 sec),"And by the way, we need people helping you. We need people coming in. We need people to run the farms. We're going to have people coming in. But they're going to come in legally, and they're going to come in through merit, through merit. It's called the merit system. [Audience chants Build the wall]  And we've built the wall -- we're building the wall."
00:13:01 - 00:13:51 (50 sec),"We've started. A lot of it's getting done right now. We got $1.6 billion. Another $1.6 billion. And another $1.6 billion. I want 'em to give us the money so I can build it -- we can build it in a year. But we've done a lot of it. It's going up right now.  But, you know, the Democrats feel that that's one thing we really want, we got our money for the military, $700 billion."
00:13:51 - 00:14:11 (20 sec),"We got our money to help us out with the opioid crisis, $6 billion.  But when it comes to the wall, they feel we want it so badly, but we keep getting big chunks and we keep building that wall. And it's under construction. And we're going to get it finished sooner than anyone would believe. And if you could get me some Republicans, we'll get it done quickly."
00:14:11 - 00:14:34 (24 sec),"Quickly.  I mean, when I have to ask Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters...  ... Maxine Waters, can we build a wall, Maxine? No, I don't want that wall built. She doesn't want a wall built. Can we build it? How about -- how about Pelosi? We want to build a wall. No, I don't want that wall built.  Look, Iowa manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest rate in more than 20 years."
00:14:34 - 00:15:09 (35 sec),"And if you remember...  ... the last administration, without mentioning names, the last administration said manufacturing jobs, they're dead. They're gone. We have 600,000 have come back since the election.  Six hundred thousand. More Americans are now working than ever before. Think of that. At this point today, this day, we have more Americans by far working -- right now working than have ever worked in our country before."
00:15:09 - 00:15:33 (24 sec),"Isn't that great? That's a big number. That's a big number.  Today I kept another major promise, as I said, to the people of Iowa and Nebraska and other countries.  Wait. Hey, wait a minute. I got to do that again. I got to do that again. I love Nebraska. You know we won Iowa, we won Nebraska...  But they said, sir, you're speaking in Iowa, but we'll have some people from Nebraska there."
00:15:33 - 00:15:56 (23 sec),"What the...  Like I said, Nebraska...  OK, so -- and we have both. By the way, we have both great governors here.  And I did that just in case. So, ready? I'm going to go Iowa first, then I'm going to go Nebraska. I just want to see who the hell I'm speaking to.  OK? Because that was a little shocking what I just heard."
00:15:56 - 00:17:09 (73 sec),"So I'm going to go -- I'm just curious, OK? Iowa.  Nebraska.  Unbelievable. So they said, sir, you're speaking in Iowa, there may be a few people coming in from Nebraska. I don't think that's right. Great going, fellas. Great going. I'll tell my staff, great going, fellas.  Doesn't matter. We love both. Who cares, right?"
00:17:09 - 00:17:31 (23 sec),"Who cares? We love 'em.  All I know is you've got a lot of farmers in both, right?  And my administration is protecting ethanol, all right? That's what you want to hear.  Today, we are unleashing the power of E15 to fuel our country all year long. Not eight months. All year long.  The Dems will end ethanol."
00:17:31 - 00:18:33 (61 sec),"You know that. They're not going to approve ethanol. They will take it away as -- we'll try and make it, like, so they can't do it to -- but they will find a way to take it away if you give them rights. You better get out there and vote for Republicans.  We've also achieved another historic victory for Iowa farmers and ranchers, by replacing the job-killing NAFTA with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA."
00:18:33 - 00:19:15 (42 sec),"But if Democrats take control, they will try to reverse our amazing progress and plunge our country into gridlock, frankly, into poverty, ultimately into chaos. That's what's going to happen.  And we've never had it like it's been now. We've never had it like it is now. Look at all the money you people are making."
00:19:15 - 00:19:45 (30 sec),"What are you going to do with it?  Democrats want to raise your taxes, impose socialism, dismantle law enforcement...  ... eliminate ICE...  ... and get rid of American borders. You want to get rid of the borders, right? You won't have a country.  And I've been saying this, and I mean it. Democrats are the party of crime."
00:19:45 - 00:19:59 (14 sec),"They are. Republicans are the party of safety. We are also the party of jobs, jobs, jobs.  Now, we're thrilled to be joined tonight by a number of terrific Republican leaders. Iowa Congressman Steve King...  Where's Steve? Where is he? Where is Steve? Where is he? I wish he could get a little bit more conservative."
00:19:59 - 00:20:22 (23 sec),"Can you believe this guy? He may be -- we're all -- he may be the world's most conservative human being.  Thank you, Steve.  And I supported him long before I became a politician. Do I have to use that term? Am I a politician?  Thank you, Steve. And another great, great gentleman, so much help to me, Congressman Jeff Fortenberry."
00:20:22 - 00:20:51 (29 sec),"Thanks, Jeff. Great job. Thank you. They're always with us. They are -- those two, always with us.  Another friend of mine, got to know him during the primaries, got to know him during the election. We took this state by storm. He helped. But I did even better than him. You know, you still need a -- you still need a product, right?"
00:20:51 - 00:21:18 (27 sec),"But we did great. And we love the people of Iowa. We took Nebraska equally.  By a lot. By a lot. That wasn't close. Iowa GOP Chair -- friend of mine -- Jeff Kaufmann. Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. Great job, Jeff. Get ready, Jeff. We're coming back soon, Jeff. And from Nebraska...  ... where's Tom Osborne, huh?"
00:21:18 - 00:22:04 (46 sec),"Where is he? Where's Tom Osborne?  And I don't know Tom Osborne. All I know -- it's ""Tom Osborne,"" right? All I know is for years all he knew how to do is win, win, just win.  I mean, how good a coach was that guy? You know, there's a guy -- again, I don't know him, never met him. But it's called no talk, all action."
00:22:04 - 00:22:27 (24 sec),"Isn't that nice?  Now, what you did every year, you won. Better get going, Nebraska.  But we have a governor who's done a fantastic job. He's so into so many different things, including cutting your taxes, and we have him with us, Governor Pete Ricketts. Pete?  Great guy. Great. I think they like you, Pete."
00:22:27 - 00:22:43 (16 sec),"Vote for Ricketts. That's November. Right? Vote for Ricketts. He's got an opponent that doesn't have what you need, but still you never know. You got to get out there and vote, right, Pete? You have a vote. Great job, Pete.  And Congressman Don Bacon...  Incredible guy. Great job, Don. He's always there."
00:22:43 - 00:23:07 (24 sec),"He's always there, Don Bacon. He's always there. Thank you, Don. Great job. Appreciate it. Every time we needed him, he's there. Thank you.  And Nebraska GOP Chair Dan Welch. Thank you, Dan. Thanks, Dan. What a great group. And I am especially thrilled to introduce a person just to come up for a second to say a couple of words, because she has become a real star in the Republican Party and in politics."
00:23:07 - 00:23:37 (30 sec),"Kim Reynolds, she fights every day for the people of Iowa. And she always delivers and -- wow, does she have my endorsement. She's incredible. Kim, please come up. Kim Reynolds.  Kim Reynolds."
00:23:37 - 00:24:15 (37 sec),"Thank you so much. Oh, my gosh! This is amazing! Thank you all for being here! This is incredible! Welcome back, Mr. President, to the great state of Iowa. And on behalf of all Iowans, I want to say thank you, thank you for cutting taxes for hard-working Iowans, for eliminating senseless regulations that stifled innovation and jobs, for standing strong with Justice Kavanaugh and appointing conservative judges to the court!"
00:24:15 - 00:24:50 (35 sec),"Thank you. Thank you for USMCA and for KORUS. And, Mr. President, thank you for year-round E15! Our farmers thank you. Iowans thank you. And we are grateful. Promises made, promises kept. The Midwest has a partner in the White House with President Donald Trump. Woo! It is an incredible honor to serve as the 43rd governor of this great state."
00:24:50 - 00:25:14 (24 sec),"And my story is the Iowa story. It's a reflection of the opportunities that exist here, where a small-town girl, daughter of a factory worker and farmer, who waited tables, checked groceries, never gave up on her dream of getting a college degree, is standing before you today as the first female governor of the state of Iowa."
00:25:14 - 00:25:37 (22 sec),"I understand the challenges that everyday Iowans have faced because I've faced them myself. And that's why I'm proud that we focused on cutting taxes, expanding and growing jobs and wages and opportunities, addressing Iowa's health care needs and creating strong and safe communities. Iowa is working. The Midwest is working."
00:25:37 - 00:26:24 (48 sec),"And we're getting things done. We're recognized as the number-one state in the country, second lowest unemployment, third best managed, wages are going up, taxes are going down. Our budget is balanced. And we're going to keep Iowa moving. We need your help. We need -- Republicans need your help. We need your support."
00:26:24 - 00:26:56 (31 sec),"And to do that, we have to show up. We have to go vote. And if you do that, I promise you, Republicans up and down this ticket are going to be a partner for our great president, to keep the Midwest and moving forward and to keep the United States of America number one! God bless you! God bless the great state of Iowa and the United States of America!"
00:26:56 - 00:27:18 (22 sec),"Wow. Good energy. That's what you need, good energy. Thank you, Kim. Great. By the way, Kim's opponent this November is a radical Dem named Fred Hubbell. He's got some problems. He's weak on crime, weak on borders, doesn't want any. Only wants to massively raise your taxes. He wants to take away your ethanol."
00:27:18 - 00:27:46 (28 sec),"What I'm giving you, he will take, very quickly. Wants to devastate your farms and businesses with an avalanche of job-killing regulations that we just got rid of. Everybody get out and vote for Governor Reynolds on Election Day. Finally, I want to introduce another great Iowa Republican, Congressman David Young."
00:27:46 - 00:28:15 (29 sec),"When you said, David -- he's a great guy -- he's another one, fellas, he's with us, he's with us all the way -- when you said, David, to Congress you voted to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, tax care of our veterans -- our veterans, we love 'em. Veterans' choice. We got veterans' choice. After 44 years, we got veterans' choice."
00:28:15 - 00:28:33 (18 sec),"He voted -- thank you very much. He voted to secure our borders, stop the visa lottery horror show. Can you imagine it? This is legislation. They put names in a bin. We picked names. Do you think we're -- they're putting their finest? We get these people -- a lottery, can you believe? We want a merit system."
00:28:33 - 00:29:03 (31 sec),"We don't want a lottery system. We want a merit system. And we're going to get it. And we're on our way to getting it. Need a few more votes. We got to get some Republicans. And he voted -- and he -- believe this is somebody -- he's not into the American military, but we are. We are really into the American rebuilt military."
00:29:03 - 00:29:40 (37 sec),"But David is a true champion of the military. He loves our military. He loves our vets. David, get on up here, David. Come up. Come here. Remember this. A vote for David is a vote for me and our agenda to make America great again. David, come up."
00:29:40 - 00:30:06 (25 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Wow. This is incredible. Thank you for showing up tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. It's such a pleasure to have you in Iowa. For years, presidents have made promises about E15 year round. We've got a president who delivered, and he did it. Thank you for keeping your promise, Mr. President."
00:30:06 - 00:30:45 (39 sec),"Yeah! Look at the economy, 4.2 percent growth, 3.7 percent unemployment rate across the country, 2.5 percent unemployment rate here. Incredible things are happening, folks. Allowing hard-working Iowans to keep their hard-earned dollars. Opportunity, the American dream. Thank you, Mr. President. Rebuilding our military and signing into law the largest pay increase for our military in almost 10 years."
00:30:45 - 00:31:26 (41 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Securing our border, Mr. President. Thank you. And thank you for getting us out of that bogus Iran deal. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Mr. President, for finally moving our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in Israel. And, Mr. President, you are looking out for veterans."
00:31:26 - 00:32:26 (60 sec),"Thank you for that. Hey, folks. Elections are about choices, right? We can keep moving forward, or we can allow Nancy Pelosi and her hand... and her hand-picked candidates to take us backwards. We cannot go backwards to higher taxes, more government, a weaker military, and the failed policies of the past."
00:32:26 - 00:32:47 (21 sec),"I need your support. We need your support. Talk to your friends. November 6th. Vote. Go to davidyoungforiowa.com to volunteer. Thank you, Mr. President. God bless you. God bless this great country. God bless Iowa. God bless you."
00:32:47 - 00:33:13 (26 sec),"Thank you, David. A vote for David's far-left opponent, Cindy ""Tax Me""... Remember that name, Cindy ""Tax Me"". It's a very good name, actually, for her. I guess it's actually Axne. But we call her ""Tax Ne"". That was so easy. I didn't hear that one, but I don't know if anyone's thought of it, but that's like a natural."
00:33:13 - 00:33:51 (38 sec),"Is a vote for the radical agenda of Pelosi and Schumer and, of course, Maxine Waters. ""Tax Me"" opposed our massive tax cuts. That's why her name. She was born with the right name. And she wants a socialist takeover of health care, which is going to destroy our entire city. Cindy Axne is totally controlled by Pelosi and the extreme Washington liberals who are bankrolling her campaign, totally bankrolling her campaign."
00:33:51 - 00:34:14 (23 sec),"If you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming -- can you believe this -- the speaker of the House? Then you need to vote for David Young, who is a terrific, terrific guy. Terrific guy. And you also need to vote for a great friend of mine, who really through just force of will got us to put up millions of dollars to build a dam to stop your flooding in a very important part of Iowa, Congressman Rod Blum."
00:34:14 - 00:34:58 (44 sec),"Great guy. And I have to say, Rod is fighting to reform welfare, reduce crime, and continuously cut your taxes. Rod's opponent, Abby Finkenauer -- who the hell is that? Who is that? Is an extreme liberal who supports mass amnesty. Anybody like amnesty? For illegal aliens, wants to raise your taxes through the roof, and wants to take away your health care."
00:34:58 - 00:35:32 (34 sec),"So you got to vote for Rod Blum. Got to vote for David Young. You've got to vote for these two characters over here who have been there. We don't even bring them up, because they're leading by so much, I said, I'm not going to waste your time. But get out and vote anyway, just in case, right? Just in -- you never know."
00:35:32 - 00:35:57 (25 sec),You never know. A majority of House Democrats have already signed up for a socialist health care plan that would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for 20 million seniors. Republicans want to protect Medicare. We're protecting it for our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it all of their lives.
00:35:57 - 00:36:26 (28 sec),"Right? And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We are going to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. The Democrat agenda is radical socialism and open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. What a great idea. You know why? Because the people that work for ICE, they love our country."
00:36:26 - 00:37:06 (41 sec),"But they're very tough people. Guess what? That's what we need to take care of MS-13, all the gangs. You don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. Even you don't want to do it. I don't want to do it, either. They're fantastic people. They love our country. And to them, it's a day in the office. For other people, they want no part of it. They want to turn America, these Democrats -- and that's what they want -- into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and the MS-13 killers... that we're getting out of the country, by the way, by the thousands."
00:37:06 - 00:37:44 (38 sec),"Thousands. They've taken over towns in Long Island. I mean, literally. It could happen to your community. They've taken over towns in Long Island. And we go in, and we, like, liberate the towns. Can you believe -- towns that I grew up right next to. I know every one of them. And they go in and they go in and they have no fear and they take care of the situation, they get them the hell out of there or they put them in jail."
00:37:44 - 00:38:01 (17 sec),"They either send them back where they came from or they put them in jail. And they liberate -- literally, can you imagine we're saying this about places in our country? They liberate towns and small cities in different places of Long Island and others. They liberate them, like we're taking over a war and we get liberated."
00:38:01 - 00:38:31 (29 sec),"How sad. How pathetic. And if we didn't have ICE, it wouldn't happen. It wouldn't happen. So we have to cherish our law enforcement. We have to protect our law enforcement. The Democrat immigration policies aren't just wrong, they're lethal. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens that sneak into our country."
00:38:31 - 00:39:13 (42 sec),"And Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE and Border Patrol and our great law enforcement, including your great local law enforcement. If you want to have safe communities, if you want to have a border, then you must organize. Remember this. You don't have a border, you don't have a country, folks, OK, let's face it. Let's face it. You know, we're doing things that are incredible outside, but things are happening you won't even -- you'll see."
00:39:13 - 00:39:45 (32 sec),"You'll see what happens. You take a look at what's going on with North Korea. They were ready to go to war with North Korea. Now we're getting along very nicely. It's working out very well. Look at Iran. Before I got there, Iran was going to take over the Middle East in like 12 minutes, right? Now they're trying to survive."
00:39:45 - 00:40:09 (24 sec),"You got riots in every city. So if you want to really just keep up what we're doing and keep this country -- we have tremendous potential. You know, we're doing well. But we have tremendous potential to grow incredibly. When we get rid of these horrible, disgusting trade deals, with China, over the last five, six years, we've been losing $300 billion to $500 billion a year, billion."
00:40:09 - 00:40:34 (25 sec),"Nobody even knows what the hell it is, it's so much. It's ending. It's ending. It's ending. And it's not just China. It's not just China. And what we do is we protect wealthy countries for nothing. For nothing. Would you say Saudi Arabia is wealthy? Yeah. Right? And I said to the king, you've got to pay."
00:40:34 - 00:41:07 (32 sec),"I'm sorry. You've got to pay. We're going to protect, you've got to pay. Get the money. You've got to pay. You've got to pay! I have friends in the audience, they're good businessmen. They're looking like, absolutely. They -- but you're not a politician. A politician doesn't -- you got to pay. Japan is an immensely wealthy country."
00:41:07 - 00:41:37 (30 sec),"Great people. Prime Minister Abe just had a big election, won by a landslide. He's a friend of mine. But I said, look, we're protecting Japan. They're making a fortune. They're sending us millions of cars. We're not allowed to send them -- they have barriers. We can't send them cars. But they send millions of cars into here."
00:41:37 - 00:42:18 (41 sec),"They pay essentially no tax. And we subsidize their military. When I say subsidize, I'm not talking about like for 2 percent. We pay for 70 percent of their military. Nobody knows this! And I said to the prime minister, who's a great guy, I said, how come? And he honestly says, nobody ever asked. When we straighten out this, we have so much potential."
00:42:18 - 00:42:40 (22 sec),"And there are many countries like that. I'm not looking at just those two. There are many, many countries like that. And you know what? We should protect people that can't protect themselves and they're getting slaughtered. It's OK. It's OK. That's OK. And we're now building by far the strongest military that we've ever had."
00:42:40 - 00:43:17 (38 sec),"And the reason is... And the reason is that when you have the strongest military ever in the history of this world, nobody's going to mess with you. These big guys know it over here. These people know it. I don't want to use our military. But this is a very dangerous world. This is a sick world, in many ways, OK? It's a very, very -- I mean, I see things as president that you don't want to know about."
00:43:17 - 00:43:39 (22 sec),"The things that I see, you don't want to know about. We have to be on guard for some really treacherous people that are running some places -- and we are so prepared you have no idea. We are so prepared. We are so prepared. Because this election is about security. And it's also about prosperity. Since the election... [Audience member calls out Seal Team Six] SEAL Team is right."
00:43:39 - 00:44:08 (29 sec),"Who's SEAL team? The good-looking guy over there, that's good. SEAL Team, they're great. But since the election, we've created -- nobody believes this. If I would have said this when I came to Iowa many times or when I came to Nebraska many times... With your governor, with your governor, if I would have said that we would create 4.2 million new jobs, the fake news media -- look at this, it's like the Academy Awards back there... Look."
00:44:08 - 00:44:32 (24 sec),"The fake news would have said, oh, what he's saying, oh, it's -- oh -- well, guess what? We created 4.2 million jobs just since the election. And... We lifted over 4 million people off of food stamps. How good is that? We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country."
00:44:32 - 00:45:07 (35 sec),"And African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. And Kanye West, who gets it... And Big Jim Brown, how do you think he'd do in the NFL today? Bum, the greatest. But they're coming over to the White House very shortly. We're going to have a little lunch and talk about it. But they get it! How do you -- how do you win when you hear those numbers?"
00:45:07 - 00:45:37 (30 sec),"Because the Democrats for 100 years have been promising African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asians. They've been promising everything, nothing happens. Here we are, less than two years, the best employment numbers, the best numbers they've ever had in virtually every category. Every category. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment rates have also reached all-time lows."
00:45:37 - 00:46:05 (28 sec),"How do you -- how do you beat us in 2020? Governor, do you have any idea? What would you say? What would you say? We're going to do a great job. But, yeah, but we have the best numbers ever recorded. Those debates I look forward to. See, I said we were going to do that. Remember? What the hell do you have to lose?"
00:46:05 - 00:46:36 (32 sec),Remember that? Right? I said we were going to do it. But now we've done it. So how's somebody going to do better? But we're going to do much better than even that. Women's unemployment rate just fell to 3.6 percent. Which is the lowest in more than 65 years. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning.
00:46:36 - 00:47:28 (51 sec),"We have finalized a new fair trade deal for South Korea. They don't even talk about -- that's a big deal. We just did a deal, manufacturers, farmers. The deal was so bad. That was a Hillary Clinton deal. She said -- no, no. She was secretary of state. [Audience chants Lock her up] She made a statement today, they're doing a tour, her and her husband or something."
00:47:28 - 00:47:51 (23 sec),"And she made a statement, some ridiculous -- I said, well, that's why she lost the election. She just doesn't get it. She's never gotten it. But she never got it -- so she said, we will create 250,000 jobs. And everybody was excited. Unfortunately, she was right, but it was created in South Korea, not in our country."
00:47:51 - 00:48:35 (44 sec),"Just another deal, check it off. Just another horrible deal. We will create 250,000 for -- you know if she said for South Korea, at least it would have been honest, right? But we've totally renegotiated that. Under the guise of massive tariffs -- I said, if you're not going to do it, we're just going to put tariffs in, that's it. And they said, let's do it. Come on. Let's do it. Let's make a decent deal."
00:48:35 - 00:49:13 (38 sec),"And we've opened it up for your farmers, for your manufacturers. We've taken a horrible deal and made it a good deal. Made it a good deal. And now we're opening up or we're going to do something where we do even better, but we're going to open up Japan for trade and the European Union, which is brutal. They are brutal."
00:49:13 - 00:50:08 (55 sec),"Sounds so nice. So nice. The European Union. Sounds so nice, right? They are brutal. But that's because they've had their way. They formed in order to take advantage of us on trade. Now, we protect most of those countries. European Union, NATO. We protect most. So Germany is paying 1 percent. We are paying 4.3 percent to protect Europe."
00:50:08 - 00:50:32 (24 sec),"Explain that one to me, OK, please? The numbers are horrific. But I've gotten $44 billion last year, more paid into NATO by other countries. And this year will be more than that. That's why I say, our country has such incredible potential. There's so many -- I mean, I could go through deal -- I could go through so many things, just the same thing."
00:50:32 - 00:51:08 (36 sec),"They were going to build the embassy in Israel. As you know, we got approved, right? On my desk was a document to get ready to spend over $1 billion to build a building. I said, how do you spend $1 billion to build a building? I didn't look, but probably like one story, it's an embassy, right, two stories, a billion dollars."
00:51:08 - 00:52:00 (52 sec),"And I said, maybe we can get a building and renovate it and fix it up real fast, and who knows? And our great -- our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, called. He said, you know, we have the best site in Jerusalem. And there's a beautiful building on it. And we can take just a big corner of that building, fix it up, and instead of waiting 20 or 25 years, by the time this thing got worked out, we could have it in about four months, sir."
00:52:00 - 00:52:29 (29 sec),"I said, what do you mean the site's the best? He said, well, we were there early. We've had the site for many years. The building is good, but, you know, we have to renovate. So we're going to spend a billion and probably never get it open, right? And, by the way, had we spent a billion, it would end up costing $3 billion or $4 billion for -- you know, people would look at it, probably one-third the size of this room."
00:52:29 - 00:53:03 (34 sec),"They'll spend $2 billion. So I said, David, how much is it going to cost to do that? And how good is the site? Site's great. And, sir, the building is set way back, which is good for purposes of security. They like that. They don't want it right on the sidewalk. I can't imagine why. Set way back. He said, sir, it's beautiful."
00:53:03 - 00:53:42 (39 sec),"And it's a big site. We can do other things later. I said, how much is it going to cost? He said, sir, it's going to cost about $180,000. I told him, we'll think about it. True, $180,000. First time in my life I've ever done this. First time. Don't get angry at me. I said, David, it's too cheap. It doesn't sound good."
00:53:42 - 00:54:03 (21 sec),"I never did that before. I never did it before. Like, I like to say, like Air Force One, we gave out the contract. They were going to give it out for $1.6 billion more than I gave it out for. They'll tell you. I said to Boeing, I'm not going to pay that price. And I said, I'm not paying it. Cancel the contract."
00:54:03 - 00:54:33 (29 sec),"I'm not paying it. And I held a line. I said, you got to take off $1.8 billion. They called back a day later. Supposing we took off $1.6 billion? I said you have a deal, OK. I actually did that. I actually said cut it in half, OK? But we don't have to go through the whole deal. But with the -- with the -- with the embassy, I said, David, David, $180,000, it's too cheap."
00:54:33 - 00:54:55 (22 sec),"We've got to spend more than that. It doesn't sound good. But, sir, I can do a really -- I said, I know you can, but it's not going to play well. You mean we took it from $1 billion to $180,000? I said, David, I said, you know what, David, make it $400,000. And use Jerusalem stone. Did anybody ever see it? It's the most beautiful stone."
00:54:55 - 00:55:13 (18 sec),"And you're in Jerusalem, right? I mean, what's -- probably inexpensive. Most expensive stone when you bring it here. But you're in Jerusalem. They should have plenty of it, right? I said, David, use beautiful Jerusalem stone and let's do it. We opened it up four months later for $400,000. Can you believe it? Open."
00:55:13 - 00:55:41 (28 sec),"It's open. I could tell you many of these stories. I could tell you many. I could tell you so many of these stories. There's that story, and I got 30 more we could take about. The way we spend -- he says I want to hear more. Should I give you one more of those stories? All right. All right, one story. So we like South Korea."
00:55:41 - 00:56:21 (40 sec),"We've got 32,000 soldiers over there. Thank you very much, United States. They don't pay. They don't pay us, but that's OK. They're very successful. And the Obama administration gave this incredible -- it's all right. Don't worry. It's being mostly dismantled. Mostly dismantled. So my first week in office, I get there, and I notice there's this incredible THAAD system, THAAD system to knock down rockets."
00:56:21 - 00:56:49 (28 sec),"Shoots down rockets, shoots down missiles, most incredible thing you've ever seen. I think they got like a 97 percent shot at it. And the company likes to say, but if you send up two missiles, you get it 100 percent. But that's expensive. I said, do it with one, right? So I get there, and brand new, they put in. I said, just out of curiosity, who pays for it? I said to a certain general, good guy, but, you know, he's not into business."
00:56:49 - 00:57:11 (21 sec),"He's into winning wars, but they're not into business. They don't care. OK. He's into winning, but not into business. He's got a little business, too. So I said, so, let me ask you something. How much does that system cost? Sir, I don't know. As a businessman, you, by the way, a good businessman, you know what I'm talking about."
00:57:11 - 00:57:29 (18 sec),"How much does that cost? Sir, I don't know. Who pays for it? Sir, I don't know. Now, you got to understand, the purpose of this -- it's on the border. This is in the time when we were having a little problem, you know, at the beginning. A lot of people thought we were going to war, but we're doing nicely now."
00:57:29 - 00:57:51 (22 sec),"But I said, so let me get this -- we have a system that's very expensive. And we shoot down rockets that are shot from North Korea to South Korea to shoot down -- OK, so we're protecting South Korea, right? Why aren't they paying? Well, I don't know. I don't -- I said, General, immediately go and find out who's paying for it and how much."
00:57:51 - 00:58:39 (48 sec),"So he goes, next morning, he comes into my office. Sir, we are an ally of South Korea. And therefore, we are paying for the system, sir. I said, I thought so. Then I said, all right, give me the bad news. Raytheon. Give me the bad news. How much is it going to cost? Sir, $1 billion. I said, whoa, whoa! So we're putting in a system that we pay for and it's going to cost $1 billion in order to protect an immensely wealthy country that makes all of your television sets, right?"
00:58:39 - 00:59:22 (42 sec),"Samsung, LG, I order a lot of them, South Korea. And I'm trying to figure that out, Steve King, as a true conservative, but I'm trying to figure it out. So we do this, and I said, do me a favor. Go back to the country. Renegotiate that deal. That's not a good deal. But, sir, the Obama administration has already agreed to it. I said I don't care if they agreed to it. I couldn't care less if they agreed to it. I don't care."
00:59:22 - 00:59:57 (35 sec),"So that's the second or third story. I could go on all night, but I want to get the hell out of here, OK? Because I thought I was coming to Iowa, and there's more people from Nebraska. Right, Pete Ricketts? Pete Ricketts. Governor Ricketts. We love you both. We love you both. After years of rebuilding other nations, I could give you 30 stories."
00:59:57 - 01:00:26 (29 sec),"I -- I could give you 100 stories like that -- we're finally rebuilding our nation. That's what we're doing. America is not being taken advantage of anymore. America is being respected again. With Republicans in Congress, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. Big numbers."
01:00:26 - 01:01:02 (36 sec),"So important for the farmers and small business. To save your family farms and ranches, we've virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. So now if you like your children or love your children, you can leave your beautiful farm to your children and they won't have to pay any taxes. They won't have to go to your local banker, borrow money, and end up losing the farm, which was happening."
01:01:02 - 01:01:22 (20 sec),"Now you won't have any -- you guys know that, that's a big deal -- that's a big deal, Jeff and Steve and everybody. That's a big deal, because people were leaving their farms, they go out, they mortgage their farms, then they end up -- the kids end up going through hell and losing their farms. So now you won't have to go to the bank, borrow money, put a mortgage on. But here's the thing."
01:01:22 - 01:01:46 (24 sec),"If you don't like your kids, or if you don't love your kids, it doesn't have any impact on you. Sell the farm. Enjoy yourselves and relax. Don't give them anything. Don't give them anything if you don't like them. Don't give them anything! We're reducing the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients access life-saving treatment we passed."
01:01:46 - 01:02:10 (24 sec),"And right to try. Right to try. We all know what it is. We have right to try now. For years, people wanted to access some of these cures that worked, but they can't get approved, because it's a long process which we've cut way down. Right to try. They were terminally ill and they couldn't get treatment of something that may work."
01:02:10 - 01:02:33 (23 sec),"We just signed right to try. And these guys helped a lot, right? Steve, Jeff, everybody. They helped a lot. David was great, David Young. So now you get the right to try. People used to travel all over the world if they had money. If they didn't have money, they'd go home. They had no hope. Now they can get treatment."
01:02:33 - 01:03:05 (32 sec),"They sign a document, they can get treatment. They tried for 40 years to get that passed. We got it passed. Right to try. I love it. We also passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. Big thing. Forty-four years. Forty-four years, they've tried to get it passed. People are waiting on line for 12 days, for 20 days, for 28 days."
01:03:05 - 01:03:32 (27 sec),"People aren't that sick. By the time they see the doctor, seriously, they're terminally ill. They couldn't see a doctor. Now we have the right to let them go see a private doctor. We pay for the bills. It's great for them. It actually is saving for us. Forty-four years. Forty-four years. Forty-four years."
01:03:32 - 01:03:53 (20 sec),"I thought it was my idea, but then I came back and I said -- what a great idea. They said, we've been trying to get it passed for 44 years. I mean, how simple? Right? Forty-four years. But because of guys like this, right, Steve, Jeff, everybody, Governor, you were incredible, Pete Ricketts. You helped so much."
01:03:53 - 01:04:19 (27 sec),"All of you guys. And the landmark V.A. accountability law. You couldn't fire anybody. There were -- literally, there were sadists working for the V.A. There were bad people. There were thieves. Horrible people. You couldn't fire them. We passed -- I think it's 46, 47 years. Look, I hate to say it. Union problems."
01:04:19 - 01:04:38 (19 sec),"All sorts of problems. Civil service problems. Pretty strong lobby, right? We got it passed, 44, 46 years. And now when we catch people that aren't taking care of our veterans, we look at them, we say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here! It's true. It's true. [Audience chants Trump] Now, you know, they don't spin the cameras."
01:04:38 - 01:05:09 (30 sec),"Tell this -- I said in the beginning to spin. Nobody does it. Because they don't want to show how big these crowds are. They -- no, I'm telling you. They don't want to show it. They don't want to show it. Look, they're not spinning. Do you see one camera turning? No, they don't want to show all these people."
01:05:09 - 01:05:49 (40 sec),"They don't want to show it. I don't see -- look, I don't see one camera turning. They don't want to show them. Our great first lady -- I come home, I said, did they show the crowd? No, but it sounded massive. Right? It sounded -- sounded -- looks like an Iowa -- Iowa state or Nebraska football game. That's what it sounds like."
01:05:49 - 01:06:16 (28 sec),"That's what it sounds like. Right? That's what it sounds like. So my wife would say, they didn't show the crowd, but it sure as hell sounded big. You know, when you have crowds like this, you can't cheat on the sound. I mean, it's a lot of people. But they cheat, because they -- they never show the crowd."
01:06:16 - 01:06:51 (35 sec),"We secured... $716 billion to fully rebuild our great American military. And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Air Force, the Space Force. Very important. Very important. We got to get that done, Congressman. Everybody wants that. So important. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
01:06:51 - 01:07:18 (27 sec),"They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Iowa and Nebraska. And we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. [Audience chants USA] And, by the way, speaking of the NFL... No, it's OK. But you know, for years, the NFL had a big problem with Canada and the Super Bowl and rights."
01:07:18 - 01:08:13 (55 sec),"It's a complicated thing, but it doesn't matter. And I heard about the problem. And we were dealing with them on a much, much, much bigger issue. And the NFL is a great American company. And I told my people, give the damn NFL problem solved. It took them about two minutes. And I got a call from the commissioner."
01:08:13 - 01:08:36 (23 sec),"I thought he was calling about the flag. I thought he was calling to say we have fully agreed that we are all going to stand at attention with our hand on our heart, helmet on the ground, and salute -- he didn't. But a good guy. He called me to thank me. You know why I did that? I did that -- nobody told me to do it. I did that because I knew they had a problem."
01:08:36 - 01:08:53 (17 sec),"And it's a great American company. Whether we like it, don't like it, doesn't matter. It's a great American company. And so I got it done. I got it done. Took us like two minutes. And you know what? Now the players will be paid more money and they'll still hate me. Isn't that terrible? They'll still hate Trump."
01:08:53 - 01:09:24 (31 sec),"And they get more money. But that's OK. That's why -- that's why guys like Jim Brown and Kanye and so many others like me. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote or early voting. Get out and vote or early voting."
01:09:24 - 01:09:56 (32 sec),"Vote for Governor Kim Reynolds. Vote -- I thought you were coming here as my guest. Pete, I thought you were coming here -- just today -- come on over, Pete. Vote for Pete Ricketts. I didn't know you were bringing half of Nebraska, Pete. Vote for Congressman Rod Blum and Congressman David Young. Don't bother with these two guys."
01:09:56 - 01:10:31 (35 sec),"They're going to win by -- vote for them, too, please. Vote for them, too. That's right, Steve. They're going to vote for you guys. Thank you. And thank you. Vote for Republicans. You're doing the right thing, because a vote for us is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products that are made right here in the USA."
01:10:31 - 01:11:07 (36 sec),"That's what we're doing. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division, and destruction. And you know what else? You know what else? And weakness, because it's weakness."
01:11:07 - 01:11:32 (25 sec),"And to reclaim our magnificent destiny as Americans. To everyone in this great room tonight, to every citizen watching across our land -- and there are a lot of them -- this is your time to choose. So important. Got to get out. You've got to vote. It will all be taken away if they get control, including -- they'll start appointing Supreme Court judges that you will not want."
01:11:32 - 01:12:04 (32 sec),"We'll have justices that you will say, how did this happen? You got to get out and vote. It's time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. Never forget that in 2016 we had the greatest movement in the history of our country."
01:12:04 - 01:12:40 (36 sec),"And they won't challenge that. They even admit that. They're not happy about it. They're not happy. But that was the greatest movement in the history of our country. It is not up to the media or the fake news or the pundits to decide your fate. It is up to you. You have the power. With your vote, you can do so much, but you can defend your family, defend your community, defend your country, defend your rights, your faith, and your dignity."
01:12:40 - 01:13:22 (42 sec),"Loyal citizens like you, Iowa and Nebraska, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power back to the American patriots, which is you. These states were settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women. The women actually were stronger than men, but I don't want to get into that."
01:13:22 - 01:13:44 (22 sec),"I don't want to get into that! The women are stronger than the men. I've said it for a long time. Sorry, men. Sorry, you guys. You know what I'm talking about, right? They're all nodding. You're right. Who have braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home right here. They didn't have a lot of money."
01:13:44 - 01:14:19 (35 sec),"They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They loved their families. They loved their country. And they loved their God. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage."
01:14:19 - 01:14:54 (35 sec),"For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory."
01:14:54 - 01:15:48 (54 sec),"Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you, Nebraska. Thank you. Get out and vote."
00:00:00 - 00:00:53 (54 sec),"Hello, Pennsylvania. Hello, Pennsylvania. Great people. Incredible people. And I'm thrilled to be here tonight in Erie, Pennsylvania, with thousands of loyal, hard-working, and beautiful American patriots. That's what you are. Before we begin, I want to send our thoughts and prayers of our entire nation to everyone in the path of Hurricane Michael, especially in the Florida panhandle, where it's hitting and hitting hard."
00:00:53 - 00:01:29 (35 sec),"It's a big one, one of the biggest we've ever seen. All of Pennsylvania, all of America sends its unwavering love and support. My administration is working closely with Florida Governor Rick Scott and the governors of North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, anybody else affected, to provide the full resources and steadfast support of our federal government."
00:01:29 - 00:02:00 (31 sec),"We are... We're all set to go. We're going to follow it right in. We have massive amounts of water and food. And we have the electric companies, thousands and thousands of electrical workers, they're going to follow it as it leaves. We're going to follow right behind. Help the situation. Everyone's working in close coordination with local officials."
00:02:00 - 00:02:32 (32 sec),"And I'll be traveling to Florida very, very shortly, so we just want to wish them all the best. And Godspeed. Godspeed. God bless you all. And you know -- and I speak because so many of my friends are here with us in Pennsylvania, we will spare no effort, no expense, no resource to help these great fellow citizens of ours that are going through a tough time right now."
00:02:32 - 00:03:15 (42 sec),"We know when Americans face hardship, we support each other, we stand with each other, we care for each other, and we will always pull through. It will be successful. We will always be successful at what we do. Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, again, two weeks ago, and now they're going to get a lot more water coming in. That's what they don't need is water right now."
00:03:15 - 00:03:49 (35 sec),"These are great people. Tonight we are going to discuss the extraordinary achievements we've made for our fellow citizens in less than two years' time. You know, it's been less than two years. All those beautiful red hats, Make America Great Again... And we will discuss the next steps we must take to protect this amazing progress and to continue building an even greater future for all Americans."
00:03:49 - 00:04:32 (43 sec),"That's what's happening. You look at what's going on. It's been incredible. I said the other night -- and you know that these folks will dispute us if we're wrong. But this has been the greatest revolution ever to take place in our country. Here we are. The greatest ever. I remember, during the primaries and prior to the election, they were saying, wow, this is -- this is something not -- there's been nothing like this since Ronald Reagan."
00:04:32 - 00:04:54 (22 sec),"Then it kept going and going and going, and then we actually won. In Tennessee, I remember a great Congressmen Duncan, they said, he said, sir, early voting. He said, sir, they're coming from the hills, the valleys, people that haven't voted for a long time because they didn't want to vote for the people that were running for office."
00:04:54 - 00:05:33 (39 sec),"And they've got Trump banners and Trump hats and Trump tattoos. I've never seen anything like it. All about you. And he was right. [Audience Chants USA] And then after that, they said, well, we have to go back further than Ronald Reagan, so they talk about Andrew Jackson and said, let's see, the 1830s, that's a long time."
00:05:33 - 00:06:04 (32 sec),"And then they said on election night that this superseded even Andrew Jackson. So you won it. It's yours. And we're doing well. We're doing well. We are producing and doing even better than we said we would. It's been amazing. This election is about your families, your values, and what kind of country you want to leave for your children."
00:06:04 - 00:06:54 (50 sec),"This election is about keeping America safe, keeping America strong, keeping America proud, keeping America free. And this has been a historic week for our nation. And you know what I'm talking about. You know, all my life I've heard that a president's most important decision is who he or she picks for the United States Supreme Court."
00:06:54 - 00:07:41 (47 sec),"And as you know, on Monday night, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh now sits alongside Justice Gorsuch... to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom. Two great men. They will go down as great, great justices of the Supreme Court."
00:07:41 - 00:08:25 (44 sec),"You watch. What the radical Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh and his beautiful family is a national disgrace. It's a disgrace. What they did was a disgrace. You look at Cory Booker, the way he talked, and then you look at what he did. You look at Senator Dianne Feinstein, what she did. The disgraceful behavior."
00:08:25 - 00:09:19 (54 sec),"The disgraceful leaking of documents. You look at what they did. You look at the false charges. You look at the false accusations. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace! And people were saying, thank you, sir, for sticking and thank you for not giving up. You know what? I never even thought of it, folks. I never even thought of it. Never even thought of it. But on November 6th, you can vote to reject the Democrats' shameful conduct by electing Republican House and, really, we need it badly, we need these votes, a Republican Senate."
00:09:19 - 00:10:03 (44 sec),"Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first. Just two days ago, the unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level in 50 years. It was just announced that manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high."
00:10:03 - 00:10:21 (18 sec),"Historic. Big thing, confidence. You remember the previous administration? They said, oh, you can't bring back manufacturing jobs. Really? You can't bring back... That was wrong. Remember they said you'd need a magic wand. Well, we've got -- I guess we have, right -- we have a magic wand. And those are our great jobs."
00:10:21 - 00:11:04 (43 sec),"And we are unleashing the power of Pennsylvania shale and clean, beautiful Pennsylvania coal, beautiful, beautiful, clean coal. We are putting our miners back to work. We are putting our steelworkers back to work. And by the way, I don't know how many people are in the steel industry, but one of the hottest industries -- and this was dying."
00:11:04 - 00:11:33 (29 sec),"The steel industry was dead and dying. One of the hottest industries right now in our country is American steel. U.S. Steel is opening and expanding seven different plants and spending a tremendous -- billions of dollars doing it. And what does it mean for you? Jobs, jobs, very simple. What does it mean for our country?"
00:11:33 - 00:12:05 (32 sec),"What does it mean for our country? We can't lose the steel industry. The steel industry was on its last legs, and now, after four months of really intensely doing what I do... it's thriving. It is thriving. It's amazing, actually. It's amazing. You got to have steel. You know, you need steel for defense."
00:12:05 - 00:12:35 (30 sec),"You got to have steel. Supposing you don't have steel and we do have a problem defense-wise. You going to call China, please send us some steel? And aluminum is doing great again. These are things we have to have. But beyond that, it's tremendous numbers of jobs already taking place. The head of U.S. Steel said he's never seen anything like it. And what did we do? We essentially stopped the dumping."
00:12:35 - 00:13:00 (25 sec),"They were dumping garbage all over our country. It wasn't even good. It was sand steel. It was rotted steel. It was garbage. They're dumping it all over our country. So now we can take our own metallurgic ore out of our mines that we can bring it here and to other places, and we can actually have our industry."
00:13:00 - 00:13:24 (23 sec),"We don't need this product coming in untested from other countries. We don't need it, folks. We've got it here. We don't need it. And you watch what's going to happen with jobs, and you watch what's going to happen with price. Very proud of that industry. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation."
00:13:24 - 00:14:09 (46 sec),"But if Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats... take over Congress, they will try to raise your taxes -- we've lowered them tremendously -- impose socialism, which is where they're coming from... and take over and destroy American health care. And you see how well we're doing with health care. You see it. Democrats want to abolish America's borders and allow drugs and gangs to pour into our country unabated."
00:14:09 - 00:14:51 (42 sec),"And I say this, and I mean this. The Democrats are the party of crime. That's what's happening. They are the party of crime. Republicans are the party of law, order, and justice. And we are also the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. You see that. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by several really terrific friends of mine, Pennsylvania Republicans, including a man that's helped me so much in Washington, like tax cuts, like regulation cuts, like many other things, Congressman GT Thompson."
00:14:51 - 00:15:20 (29 sec),"A man who's really doing well, if you believe in polls. I believe in polls. Only the ones that have us up, because they're the only honest ones. [Laughter] Other than that, they're the fake news poll. Fake news. Fake news. You know they take these polls, they show them, I said, that can't be right. What they want to do is keep you out of the voting booth."
00:15:20 - 00:15:56 (36 sec),"Take your wife, take your husband, go to a movie, come back, watch the results. You say, you know, I love so and so, but the polls say he can't win. Darling, let's go to a movie tonight. We'll go home and we'll watch -- and that's what happens. They talk you out of it. They're dishonest. just like their reporting is dishonest, their polls are dishonest."
00:15:56 - 00:16:18 (22 sec),"Not all of them. Not all of them. No, not all of them. But many of them, and I saw it. I saw it. And yet there were some that got us very right on that great, great evening. Was that the most exciting evening of our lives? Remember, we won Florida? And remember John King, nice guy at CNN, fake news, CNN... Remember, early -- it was early, and we won by a lot."
00:16:18 - 00:16:53 (34 sec),"We won Florida by a lot. Remember the red, right, the red, beautiful red. I never liked red so much. [Laughter] Against the blue, I didn't like blue. [Laughter] And the whole map is like red. And he's going crazy. But early, Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Oh, my gosh. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida."
00:16:53 - 00:17:27 (35 sec),"Oh, that was upsetting to him. Remember when they said that Texas would be long, it would be a long call, go late into the night, because they said it's just going to be too close to call? So the polls closed at 8 o'clock, and they never call them early unless you win by a landslide, right? So the polls closed."
00:17:27 - 00:18:13 (46 sec),"The polls have closed in the state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. Right? Which other one? Utah, remember it was so -- it was so close, Utah. They had a guy that I never saw before. I don't know. There's this guy. Do you know who I'm talking about? And they had crooked Hillary, the three of us. And this guy was supposed to come in second, but I was going to be -- it's going to be very close."
00:18:13 - 00:18:36 (23 sec),"Maybe I could edge, but this guy was going to come either first or second, and crooked Hillary was supposed to be third. So, the Utah, great people. We just gave over millions of acres of great space, public space to Utah. So what happens? What happens? So they say, oh, for weeks I'm hearing how close Utah is. So the polls close at 8 o'clock."
00:18:36 - 00:19:23 (47 sec),"Eight o'clock and three seconds, Donald Trump has won... the state of Utah. We won it by... And on top of that, this guy came in third. He didn't even come in second. Crooked Hillary came in second. A long ways away. Long ways. Remember? Anyway. But was that the most exciting night? Was that the greatest?"
00:19:23 - 00:19:44 (21 sec),"Well, if you look at it, when you think of it, there was collusion between Hillary, the Democrats, and Russia. There was collusion. There's no question about it. There was a lot of collusion with them and Russia and lots of other people, by the way. But so you remember -- so we win Florida, then we had a -- you know, to win the Electoral College is very tough."
00:19:44 - 00:20:04 (20 sec),"The other is easier. You go to three or four states and you work, and you do -- but to win, got to be smart. You're right. You got to be smart. Got to be smart. You got to -- and you have to have great support. This is our support. But you got to run the whole East Coast. If you're a Republican, it's very, very hard."
00:20:04 - 00:20:27 (23 sec),"Electoral College is much harder than anything. Remember, they said, there is no path. I heard this so many times. I said to my wife, oh -- our first lady, how's she doing? Good? I said to Melania, I said, I've heard there is no path, there is no path to 270. Right? How many times have you heard that? Thousands?"
00:20:27 - 00:20:49 (22 sec),"I've been hearing it for months. There is no path. And I kept going -- I love this state -- I kept going to Maine, for one, because they had -- maybe, if I have a great night, 269. Of course they could never say I could get to -- so I kept going to Maine five times, because I wanted to get one, and I ended up getting the one in Maine, but I also got Michigan, and Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania."
00:20:49 - 00:21:20 (31 sec),"Remember that? Remember that? And what angered me, because I love this state, and I went to school in this state, right? I went to school in this state. I love Pennsylvania. I went to school in this state. Great place. Great people. What angered me is Pennsylvania hasn't been won for many years by Republicans, but every Republican thinks they're going to win Pennsylvania."
00:21:20 - 00:21:43 (23 sec),"They didn't quite get it. But I got it. The workers, I got it. Every Republican -- I used an expression. You know, there's an expression, but under the rules of ""Me, Too,"" I'm not allowed to use that expression anymore. Can't do it. [Laughter] It's the person that got away. See, in the old days, it was a little different."
00:21:43 - 00:22:04 (21 sec),"Pennsylvania -- I'll just do it anyway. I would do it, except for these people up there. They would say, did you hear what President Trump said? Did you hear what he said? So there is expression, but we'll change the expression. Pennsylvania was always the person that got away. That's pretty good, right?"
00:22:04 - 00:22:31 (27 sec),"The person that got -- and for many years, nobody -- no Republican won Pennsylvania. And -- but they always thought they were going to. Pennsylvania, great. And then they lost it by a lot. I said I know we're going to win Pennsylvania, but all night long, they had one point. But if I lost every single vote in Pennsylvania, I was 99 percent of the vote cast, and I said, will you please project Pennsylvania?"
00:22:31 - 00:22:56 (25 sec),"Let Pennsylvania be the state where I win this election? I was winning North Carolina, South Carolina. We won Florida. We were doing -- we were running the East Coast. And I kept saying, why aren't they -- and ask them. Ask them. Why aren't they announcing Pennsylvania? One point left, 99 percent of the vote cast, right?"
00:22:56 - 00:23:21 (24 sec),"Ninety-nine percent of the vote cast. One point left. If I lost every single vote, I won Pennsylvania by a lot. I kept saying, why aren't they announcing Pennsylvania? I thought it must be some kind of a technical malfunction. [Laughter] So they didn't do it until late in the evening. It stayed forever. I kept going, why aren't they announcing?"
00:23:21 - 00:24:10 (50 sec),"I'd love to win with Pennsylvania. But honestly, then what happened? Out of the blue, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. And then out of the blue, first time in decades, Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. And then finally they announced, late in the morning, which we knew they just couldn't do it. They couldn't do it. They just couldn't. Donald Trump has won the great state of Pennsylvania."
00:24:10 - 00:24:28 (18 sec),"They didn't do it that way. They didn't do it that way. They didn't do it that way. They did it with tears flowing down their face. This can't be happening. Can this -- did you see some of them crying? And we were all crying, too, out of happiness, right? Because there has never been anything like what we all did."
00:24:28 - 00:24:55 (26 sec),"OK? We did it together. And now we're doing great trade deals. We're fixing our military. We're taking care of our vets. We are doing so much. We're cutting regulations. So you have a congressional candidate running, taking the place of a fantastic person. You know who that is. But you have a man named John Joyce who's running, and he's way up in the polls, but don't let that fool you."
00:24:55 - 00:25:35 (41 sec),"Get out and vote. Get out and vote. John Joyce. Where is John? Thank you, John. State Senators Dan Laughlin and Michele Brooks, and your next governor of the state of Pennsylvania -- I'll tell you, this guy is working hard, folks. He said he did 631 events. I said that's a lot. [Laughter] I'll tell you, he's a really good man and he's a hard-worker, and I know it's a tough race."
00:25:35 - 00:26:10 (35 sec),"But based on competence, based on everything, very successful guy. Successful businessman, which we like. Scott Wagner. Scott? And maybe the best thing I can say about Scott Wagner is that Judge Jeanine thinks he's fantastic, OK? That might be the greatest endorsement. And I -- you have my full endorsement."
00:26:10 - 00:26:37 (27 sec),"That might be the greatest endorsement I can give you, Scott. Judge Jeanine. I'm especially thrilled to introduce a terrific Pennsylvania congressmen. He's been a friend of mine for a long time, long before I did this whole political thing. A congressmen came up to me the other day, he said, sir, I've been winning for many years and I'm a proud congressmen."
00:26:37 - 00:26:58 (20 sec),"I've won many races, 10 to be exact. I've only lost three. I said, you lost three? Yes, a long time ago, when I was young. And I'm very proud, I'm a real professional. I said, you know, I've never thought of it that way, but I've only ran one time, one... It was for the presidency. And we won the presidency, right?"
00:26:58 - 00:27:38 (40 sec),"We won the president. Now, I had to do it, because he was bragging about his political career. This wasn't Mike Kelly, by the way. Somebody else. And I had to do it. I said, I never thought of it that way, but I ran one time, and we won. OK. And it's also the presidency, right? So, you know. But a man that's been a friend of mine for a long time, he's a tremendous man, and his name is Congressmen Mike Kelly."
00:27:38 - 00:28:20 (42 sec),"He loves you people. And just like your other congressmen, and John Joyce, just like your other congressmen, Mike is strong on crime, tough as hell on borders, powerful on trade, and he is really great on jobs. You see what he's doing. Mike was leading the fight, along with JT and the others, in Congress to cut your taxes, which we did at a level that they haven't seen before, cut regulations, and to protect American workers and American steelworkers."
00:28:20 - 00:28:55 (35 sec),"We're going to dredge the channel to Lake Erie. And we're going to replenish the sand to Presque Isle. Do you know what Presque Isle is? Presque Isle. They've been talking about that for a long time. Mike keeps calling, sir, we want to fix up Presque Isle. I said, Mike, what the hell is Presque Isle? [Laughter] He said, sir, it's a beautiful beach."
00:28:55 - 00:29:32 (37 sec),"I had a picture sent to me. There's no sand. That's what he wants. He wants sand. And we're going to get him the sand, OK? We're going to get him the sand. So, he's a great guy. You got to go vote for him. Let me just invite just for a couple of seconds, Mike, please, come on up. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:29:32 - 00:30:09 (37 sec),"Oh, OK, you know what? Listen, listen, President Trump and I have so much in common. First of all, he loves Pennsylvania... and he -- and he made a commitment tonight. He said, what can we do to make it even better in Erie than it is now? What can we do to take the greatest of the Great Lakes and make it better?"
00:30:09 - 00:30:38 (29 sec),"I said, Mr. President, we need to get sand replenishment. He said, how much do you need? I said, I'm not sure. He said, let me know. You're knowing to get that sand. Yeah! And then he said, so what else? What else? I said, you know what, we need to get some dredging done in the channel so that we don't have to light load any more, our ships can come in and out and get out to the world and bring goods in at a much cheaper price."
00:30:38 - 00:31:30 (52 sec),"He said, you know what, we're going to do that, too! And then I said to the president, you know what, Mr. President, you and I have a lot more in common than probably most people understand. And he goes, what would that be? I said, well, sir, we both married up. [Laughter] We both married up! So this beautiful girl standing beside me tonight, mother of four, grandmother of 10, and five of them are over there right now with my son, George, retired Army captain, and they're here because they love this president."
00:31:30 - 00:32:02 (32 sec),"Look, you know that in 2016, candidate Donald Trump came here to this same arena, to a crowd that was almost as big as this. My god, we got thousands of people outside that just want to get in. There's just not enough room for all the love. The president as a candidate said, this will not be my first trip to Erie, Pennsylvania."
00:32:02 - 00:32:34 (32 sec),"This will not be my first time to stand on the shores of the Great Lake Erie. He said, I will be back. But you know what he also did? He made promises to us in 2016. And people said, no, no, no, there's no way he can do that. There's no way we can get there. My gosh, we just spent eight years of somebody telling us in the White House that America's best days have left her."
00:32:34 - 00:33:30 (56 sec),"And you foolish, foolish people. You Americans actually still seem to think that you're exceptional. You are not exceptional! I want to tell you something. Promises made, promises kept. The strongest personality, the strongest president we have seen in our lifetime! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! [Audience Chants USA] Listen, I got to tell you, the last 21 months of my life, I have seen something happen in America that I had never seen before."
00:33:30 - 00:33:57 (27 sec),"I have seen the resurrection of the greatest nation the world has ever known. It knows no boundaries. It doesn't differentiate because of the color of your skin, the shape of your eye, what your gender is, where you worship. Every single American and at every single way every single day is stronger because of this man."
00:33:57 - 00:34:28 (31 sec),"You're the best. You are the best! Now, let me let you in on a little secret. You know, all of us deplorables are here tonight. Yeah, we're all here! But you know there's another group out there that says, you know what, we've got to win these midterms. We've got to knock this president off his perch. We've got to knock America down a notch or two."
00:34:28 - 00:35:12 (44 sec),"Well, I'll tell you, the president said, we're going to win, and we're going to keep on winning, and you're going to get tired of winning. I'll tell you, in Erie, Pennsylvania, we never get tired of winning. That's who we are! I'm going to ask you all -- I'm going to ask you all to do one thing tonight. As you look at this gentleman, who left a life that was so comfortable, who left a life that was so luxurious, to be torn apart every day, to have our first lady attacked every day, to have the first family attacked every day... that is not who we are."
00:35:12 - 00:35:53 (42 sec),"Now, you know how you're going to change that? You're going to take the enthusiasm you have tonight, you're going to take the love that you have in your heart for the greatest country in the greatest nation in the history of mankind, and you're going to get out and vote. You're going to show up in numbers that nobody ever thought would turn out."
00:35:53 - 00:37:09 (75 sec),"Now, listen. There's an old saying. You've got to play it through the whistle. Right? You got to play it through the whistle. You know what this man's saying is? You've got to play it through the echo of the whistle. Listen, I am so grateful and so thankful that an American citizen came out of nowhere to take the reins and reform and recommit this country to the greatest, greatest nation the world's ever known."
00:37:09 - 00:37:15 (7 sec),"I got to tell you, I'm with you, we're all together. Let's go win! Let's go win! Let's go win! [Audience Chants USA]"
00:37:15 - 00:37:35 (19 sec),"What do you think of that, folks? And, truly, look, he's in good shape. You see that. How would you like to be his opponent? [Laughter] But still, you never know. A vote for Mike is a vote to make America great again. It's very simple. I want to introduce another congressmen who has been a friend of mine, also, for a long time."
00:37:35 - 00:37:59 (25 sec),"And he had a very sad day yesterday. He lost his brother. He lost his brother. And he loved his brother like crazy. I said, how close? He said the closest. And a very, very strange, horrible thing happened. And he doesn't want to talk about it. But I will tell you it's a hard thing for him. And he loves this state, he loves the people."
00:37:59 - 00:38:23 (24 sec),"He's been an incredible congressman. He was a politician and various things. He went on to become a great congressman. He is so respected in Washington. And the only bad thing when he said he's going to do this, at my suggestion, I said, Lou, I'm telling you, you can win. And he said, well, if you think it's important."
00:38:23 - 00:38:56 (33 sec),"It was really at my suggestion. In other words, I got him into this. [Laughter] It could have been for the rest of his life. He could have been a congressman. But he's a special man. He's a total winner. And he had a rough time the last few days. And something else happened on top of that. But I'm honored to introduce the next United States senator from the state of Pennsylvania, my good friend, Lou Barletta. [Audience Chants Lou]"
00:38:56 - 00:39:31 (35 sec),"Thank you. Thank you very much. You know, Mr. President, I happen how much you love Pennsylvania. This is like the 9th or 10th time that you've been here. And each time that you come, the list of promises made, promises kept gets longer and longer. And that's OK with us, because now you're overseeing the greatest economy in American history right now."
00:39:31 - 00:40:01 (29 sec),"This economy is soaring. GDP last month was 4.2 percent. Unemployment, 3.7 percent. Four million new jobs were created. And this is the stat I love the most: Four million Americans came off of food stamps. Four million Americans came off of food stamps. Black unemployment at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment at an all-time low."
00:40:01 - 00:40:27 (27 sec),"Women's unemployment at a 64-year low. There are more jobs than people who are unemployed. And I'll tell you how good the economy is: This economy is so good that even Colin Kaepernick found a job. Now, who would want to stop that? Who would want to stop what's happening to the American people right now?"
00:40:27 - 00:40:54 (27 sec),"I'll tell you who wants to stop it: Bob Casey wants to stop it. Senator Bob Casey went to Washington and he forgot about Pennsylvania. He became -- in Washington, he became -- it's no surprise -- he became one of the most liberal senators in Washington. He no longer represents Pennsylvania values. I'll tell you how radical -- I'll tell you how radical he has become."
00:40:54 - 00:41:22 (28 sec),"He is so radical that he said he will vote no, no matter who the president nominates for the next Supreme Court pick. No matter who. Now, he started this craziness. He started this craziness by saying he'd be the first senator to vote no, no matter what. If you don't like the way that Justice Kavanaugh has been treated, then you can't reward Bob Casey by sending him back to Washington ever again."
00:41:22 - 00:41:51 (29 sec),"Listen, it's pretty clear -- it's pretty clear why I'm running for Senate. I'm running for Senate because the president did call and he said, I need you in the Senate. I'm running there because I want to help him because we want to show respect for our law enforcement in America once again. We want to take care of our veterans."
00:41:51 - 00:42:09 (17 sec),"No veterans should ever and will ever die waiting in line for health care in this country ever again. And we're going to support our military, those men and women who travel all over this world to make sure that we have the freedoms that we have and enjoy today and that our children and grandchildren will have that same freedom."
00:42:09 - 00:42:53 (45 sec),"We're going -- we're going to take care of our seniors. We're going to protect the unborn. We're going to put an end to illegal immigration. We're going to -- we're going to build the wall. We're going to build the way. And we are going to kneel when we pray and stand for the flag. No, Mr. President. No, Mr. President, we're not tired of winning in Pennsylvania. We're going to win again in November. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States. Thank you. [Audience Calls Out Lou]"
00:42:53 - 00:43:37 (43 sec),"That's great, Lou. Thank you very much. He's a great man. He's really -- he'll be a fantastic representative for you in Washington, D.C. Got to get out and vote. [Audience Calls Out Lou] So while Lou is fighting for you, Bob Casey is fighting to protect violent criminal aliens. That's what he's doing. Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country."
00:43:37 - 00:44:03 (27 sec),"He'll do it. For example, the sanctuary city of Philadelphia, can you believe this? Could you believe that one? That one I didn't expect to be hearing -- released a criminal alien who was recently convicted of raping and battering a very young child. Bob Casey defends criminals while attacking our brave ICE agents."
00:44:03 - 00:44:46 (43 sec),"He wants to get rid of ICE. Let me tell you about ICE. These are tough, brave people that love our country. These are people that MS-13, they're afraid of ICE. They don't like seeing ICE. And if we don't have ICE, you'll pay a big price. These are great people. These are great people. Lou Barletta and the Republican Party will always stand for the heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and our great, great law enforcement."
00:44:46 - 00:45:19 (33 sec),"These are great people. Bob Casey even voted against Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was gunned down by a five-time deported illegal alien, should have never been in our country. Bob Casey puts criminal aliens before American citizens, always has. By the way, how do you have such a liberal guy in the state of Pennsylvania?"
00:45:19 - 00:46:16 (57 sec),"I'm trying to figure that out. Oh, he's banking on the name of his father. That's no good. Which is why he needs to be voted out of office. He has to be voted out of office. Casey also voted against tax cuts, against Pennsylvania coal. He joined the left-wing mob by voting against Brett Kavanaugh. If you want to save American lives, and save American jobs, and keep things going like they're going now, which is better economically than any time in the history of our country... then you need to vote for a pro-American patriot, and he really is a patriot -- he loves this country -- named Lou Barletta."
00:46:16 - 00:46:43 (27 sec),Get out and vote please. [Audience Calls Out Lou] Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats support a socialist takeover of health care that would totally obliterate Medicare. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and who have paid for it all their lives.
00:46:43 - 00:47:23 (39 sec),"And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We're going to protect people that need help, people with pre-existing conditions. If you want security for your family, for yourself, if you want to continue our great economic boom like we've never seen before, but it's all very fragile, it can end, they want to end it, then you must go out and vote Republican."
00:47:23 - 00:47:59 (37 sec),"We need those votes in D.C. Since the election, as Lou has said, we've created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million people off of food stamps. We've added almost 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. They were supposed to be gone forever. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history."
00:47:59 - 00:48:57 (57 sec),"History. That's in history. Think of that. In history. It's got its best level on unemployment. Think of that. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in poverty. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment has always reached historic lows, lowest in history. And as I always say -- I'm sure you've heard it, I hate to say it again because I know the number is going to be changing very soon, it's going to be even better, women's unemployment has just fallen to 3.6 percent, which is only the lowest rate in 65 years."
00:48:57 - 00:49:22 (25 sec),"I'm sorry. I keep saying it. I keep waiting for that number. I'm sorry, I'd like to apologize to the women, please. Sixty-five years, best in 65 years. I keep waiting for the new number to come out, because that will be history, too, just like African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American. Women, it's only the best number in 65 years."
00:49:22 - 00:49:55 (34 sec),"I'd like to apologize. But it's very true. Women. Women for Trump. Women for Trump. Remember how badly I was going to do with women? I said, am I so bad? Remember how badly? And then I got 52 percent of the vote! And everybody said he beat crooked Hillary. What happened? What -- remember that? Remember they put up these phony numbers?"
00:49:55 - 00:50:26 (31 sec),"But you remember that? We did very well. Thank you to the women. We did very well. She never got it. The truth is she never got it. And she still doesn't get it. She's going around on a tour. Did you know this? Did you know that? I said, you should have saved it for the election. After years of being let down by Washington politicians, you now have a champion fighting for you in the White House."
00:50:26 - 00:50:58 (32 sec),"But I need your help this Election Day, November 6th, to stop the radical Democrat mob from trying to take it away. And they're going to try and take it away. They're going to try and take it away. I need you to show up at the polls to continue this incredible movement, like the country has never seen before, like probably very few countries, frankly, have ever seen before."
00:50:58 - 00:51:37 (38 sec),"The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. Then you should vote Democrat. For many years, our country was being pillaged and plundered by unfair trade deals. Pennsylvania lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs -- you know it well -- I spent lots of time with you folks up here. You know it well -- following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance, pushed by us, into the WTO, World Trade Organization, perhaps the only deal worse than NAFTA."
00:51:37 - 00:52:13 (36 sec),"We got 'em both. They were both beauties, weren't they? But the era of economic surrender is over. America is not being taken advantage of any more. Sorry. America is respected again. America is respected again. Last week, I announced that we are replacing NAFTA with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement called USMCA."
00:52:13 - 00:52:55 (43 sec),"I didn't want to use the word NAFTA. To create jobs that boost incomes, Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We've taken historic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. Did you see -- did you see four weeks ago when Pfizer and Novartis and other drug companies raised the prices of their drugs very, very substantially?"
00:52:55 - 00:53:22 (26 sec),"And I didn't like it. And I called them. I said, you can't do that. You can't do that. And the first time -- and I give them credit. And I really thank them, too, honestly. But first time in history, they rescinded their price increase and they kept it the same, and they promised no increase for a substantial time."
00:53:22 - 00:53:49 (27 sec),"But we're going to get them down. And when I called them up and they agreed to immediately rescind, perhaps that's the first time I realized how powerful it is to be the president of the United States. That was pretty -- that was pretty good. But I give them a lot of credit, and I appreciate it. We're going to get the prescription prices down, though."
00:53:49 - 00:54:12 (23 sec),"We just signed new legislation today, and there's more coming, because you are being ripped off. You know, for the same pill, for the same drug, for the same company that makes it, the same package, you go to other countries, and you'll pay half and you'll pay less than half. It's a rigged system. You remember what else I called rigged?"
00:54:12 - 00:54:44 (32 sec),"I call plenty of things in this country rigged, but we're straightening it out. But it was a rigged system. Plenty of things rigged. And to help critically ill patients access life-saving treatments, we passed something called right to try. People that are terminally ill were given no chance, no hope. We have incredible drugs in the pipeline that can cure really horrible, horrific disease."
00:54:44 - 00:55:16 (32 sec),"We wouldn't let anyone use these drugs because they didn't want to hurt them, but they're going to die. They're terminally ill! I said, what are we doing? And two months ago, I signed right to try. Somebody's terminally ill, we can try. And we've had great success. We've had great success. And by the way, in all fairness, you also find out whether or not it works."
00:55:16 - 00:55:33 (18 sec),"Not so bad. Right to try. You know what it did? These people, if they had money, they'd travel all over the world looking for a cure. If they didn't have money, they'd go home. There was nothing -- they had no hope. No -- they had no hope. Now they have great hope. We make the greatest products in the world."
00:55:33 - 00:56:00 (27 sec),"We make the greatest medicine, and we'd have hope. And some incredible things have already happened with right to try. They've been trying to pass it for 40 years. We got it passed, and that's because of your congressmen. That's because of your congressmen. That are with us tonight. We also passed veterans' choice."
00:56:00 - 00:56:38 (37 sec),"Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. Right? Our veterans. Forty-four years, they tried to pass it. When I first heard about it, I mean, it's not like I was studying it for my whole life. But I heard about it three-and-a-half years ago. I said, I have an idea. Let's -- when they wait on line for 10 days, 22 days, 38 days, you have to see, months and months, why don't we let them go see a private doctor and we paid the bill?"
00:56:38 - 00:57:05 (27 sec),"It will solve our problem. And I told everybody: I am the most brilliant guy in the world. Who else would think -- who else would think of that? So I go back to my people. I say, listen, I have this great idea. We can get these great vets to see the doctors. It's taken -- like 10 days was good. But some of them were ill, but not terribly ill."
00:57:05 - 00:57:25 (20 sec),"It took them so long, they would literally become terminally ill. It took them weeks and weeks to see a doctor. So I went to my people and I said, what an idea this is! They said, actually, sir, we've been trying to get that idea passed for 44 years. I'm good at getting things passed. We signed it three months ago."
00:57:25 - 00:57:58 (33 sec),"For our vets. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our great veterans can be held accountable. In other words, they're immediately fired. Not easy to get passed. They've been trying that one for about 46 years. We got that one passed, too. You think that was easy, getting that by -- I know you have a lot of union guys here."
00:57:58 - 00:58:26 (29 sec),"But do you think that was easy getting that by the unions? Do you think that was easy getting that passed by civil service? Not too easy. We got it passed. Somebody does something bad to our veterans, we fire them on the spot. And we secured $716 billion to fully rebuild the American military. And we gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in almost a decade."
00:58:26 - 00:59:07 (41 sec),"At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force. Very important. It's where it's at. That's where it's going. We want to always be the best. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. And I've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem."
00:59:07 - 00:59:40 (33 sec),"Many, many presidents talked about they were going to do it, and they never had whatever it takes to do it. [Laughter] And I understand why, because there was a lot of pressure on that one. There were a lot of forces saying don't do it. I say, excuse me, get lost. But we did it. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
00:59:40 - 01:00:17 (37 sec),"Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Pennsylvania. We are standing proudly for our national anthem. I need you to get your friends, get your families, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican. Vote for Lou."
01:00:17 - 01:00:59 (42 sec),"Vote for Mike. Vote for all of these great people here. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products made right here in the USA. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is the vote for safety, opportunity, prosperity, and justice."
01:00:59 - 01:01:59 (60 sec),"It is not up to the media or the pundits to decide your fate. It is up to you. It is up to the people of Pennsylvania. It is up to the people of our country. You have the power with your vote to defend your family, your country, your values, your faith, and, indeed, to defend your dignity. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power back to the American people where it belongs."
01:01:59 - 01:02:31 (32 sec),"Pennsylvania is the state that rang the Liberty Bell, forged the railroads, and put steel into the spine of our country. Generations of Pennsylvania workers manned the furnaces, farmed the fields, and fought the battles that made America into the most powerful and prosperous nation in the history of the world."
01:02:31 - 01:03:20 (50 sec),"Unfortunately, years ago, they lost their way, but we have gotten that way back. These courageous Pennsylvania patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our great and proud American heritage. For the sake of freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win."
01:03:20 - 01:04:05 (44 sec),"We will not bend, we will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, and we will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
01:04:05 - 01:04:30 (25 sec),"And always remember, together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:48 (48 sec),"Hello, Johnson City. It is great to be with you. I am thrilled to be back. I look forward to being back in the great state of Tennessee, with thousands of hard-working American patriots. That's what you are. In less than two years, we've achieved the biggest comeback in American history. You look at what's happened."
00:00:48 - 00:01:19 (31 sec),"And our country is respected again. We're respected again. Jobless claims are at a 50-year low. And the stock market is at an all-time high. The economy is booming, wages are rising, and more Americans are working today than ever before. Ever before. And think of that. Think of that. Such a simple statement."
00:01:19 - 00:01:46 (27 sec),"But such a complex thing to do. Think of it. More Americans are working today than ever before. What a beautiful statement. Get out and vote in November. It can all change around quickly, folks. We are defending our Second Amendment, taking care... But Bredesen will not defend your Second Amendment. We're taking care of our great veterans and rebuilding America's military might."
00:01:46 - 00:02:25 (39 sec),"And just today, we made history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job-killing disaster known as NAFTA... with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada -- we added Canada, worked out great -- trade agreement. And we're calling it USMCA. No more NAFTA. No more NAFTA. It's the largest trade deal the United States has ever negotiated."
00:02:25 - 00:03:23 (58 sec),"And it's also a great deal for our country. It's going to produce jobs. And companies aren't going to be leaving and firing everybody and making product and sending it back into the United States, no tax. It's there. It's modern. And it's balanced. And you know what? We have two wonderful partners now. Now they're partners, Mexico and Canada, and that's a good thing."
00:03:23 - 00:03:59 (37 sec),"That's a good thing. America's winning again, and America is being respected again, because we are finally putting America first. But radical Democrats in Congress are trying very hard to erase everything that we've achieved. They're looking out there right now and they're trying to figure out, how do they take an election because they want to take it back?"
00:03:59 - 00:04:07 (8 sec),"You look at your 401(k)s. You know, we're up from the time of the election 55 percent."
00:04:07 - 00:04:28 (21 sec),"I love you, President Trump!"
00:04:28 - 00:04:54 (26 sec),"I love you, too. He doesn't sound like my type. You know, that voice is very strong. But I love him. Whoever you are, I love you. We're just five weeks from one of the most important congressional elections of our lifetime. They're trying to take what we did in '16, something that nobody has seen maybe in other countries, not alone -- it was the greatest election victory in the history of our country."
00:04:54 - 00:05:31 (37 sec),"And between the Democrats, who are obstructionists, who are people that don't want to see strong military, they don't want borders, they don't mind crime... and their enablers, the fake news media, right back there. We've got to be very careful. We've got to be very careful. A Democrat takeover of Congress will plunge our country into gridlock and chaos and take away all of the wealth that you've earned over the last 20 months."
00:05:31 - 00:05:53 (22 sec),"This -- and think of this. The stock market, which is up at record levels, and now the highest, will drop. Your 401(k)s will be devastated. Your taxes will rise beyond your wildest imagination. And crime will flow in to our country through these open borders. Other than that, we'll be doing very well. It's crazy."
00:05:53 - 00:05:53 (0 sec),[Audience chants Built the wall]
00:05:53 - 00:06:36 (43 sec),"And we are. We want to get more money. We want to -- I could build that thing in one year. I could build it. We got $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and another $1.6 billion. We want to build it fast. I can build it -- so after the election, leadership has said, meaning Republicans, they're going to do something that's going to be very strong."
00:06:36 - 00:06:59 (23 sec),"Let's see what happens. But -- but the wall is under construction. A lot of work has been done. A lot of renovation -- if you look at some of it, some wall was up, falling down, terrible condition, now it's beautiful, brand new, and it works. It does work. We need wall. We need border security. We want -- we got to take care of our people."
00:06:59 - 00:07:30 (31 sec),"Look at what's going on. Look at what's going on in California. You have a man running for governor in California that says we don't want any borders. We don't want ICE. We do want sanctuary cities. And they're going to take care of health care, they're going to take care of education, they're going to care of everything for people that just flow in. You're going to have a billion people living in California."
00:07:30 - 00:07:55 (25 sec),"It's going to be a mess. We have it right. We have it going properly. This country will never be Venezuela, that I can tell you, because that's what they're looking for. That's what they're looking for. The Democrat Party has been completely taken over by the so-called resistance. That's all they do. They campaign on resist."
00:07:55 - 00:08:14 (19 sec),"I'll tell you something. They're only good at one thing. They stick together like glue. That's it. They have bad policy. Frankly, they're bad politicians. Everything's bad. But they stick together. We have to be very careful, they'll take everything, including your Second Amendment. They'll take everything away."
00:08:14 - 00:08:49 (35 sec),"Democrats believe that they're entitled to power, and they have been blind in a blind rage ever since, boy, they lost the 2016 -- they've gone loco. They have gone loco. They have gone crazy. This election is a choice between a Republican Party that is building our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down."
00:08:49 - 00:09:16 (27 sec),"The Democrats only know how to obstruct, demolish, and destroy. As we've seen in recent weeks, Democrats are willing to do anything and to hurt anyone to get their way, like they're doing with Judge Kavanaugh. They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he was announced, because they know that Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written."
00:09:16 - 00:09:49 (33 sec),"That's been his history. And he's a good man. Great student, great intellect. Never had a problem. All of a sudden, oh, let's go back to high school. They maybe should go before high school. And I know so many of them. You have the great Vietnam War hero who didn't go to Vietnam -- you know that, right -- Blumenthal."
00:09:49 - 00:10:16 (27 sec),"How about Blumenthal? How about Blumenthal? Da Nang Blumenthal, we call him Da Nang Blumenthal. For 15 years, as the attorney general of Connecticut, he went around telling war stories. People dying left and right, but my platoon marched forward. He was never in Vietnam. It was a lie. And then he's up there -- then he's up there saying we want the truth from Judge Kavanaugh."
00:10:16 - 00:10:56 (40 sec),"And you're getting the truth from Judge Kavanaugh. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Da Nang. You know Da Nang, right? Great city in Vietnam. And then you have Cory Booker, who destroyed Newark. I mean, the job he did in Newark. And see some of the things he wrote when he was young about women. Take a look, OK? And then they want to take a lot longer with the FBI."
00:10:56 - 00:11:19 (23 sec),"No, the FBI -- they should take -- by the way, if we took 10 years, they'd want more time. But they want to take a lot longer. But Dianne Feinstein, she had this... She had this letter for months, and she didn't reveal it until everything was finished. Then she revealed it. Then she says, oh, we want more time."
00:11:19 - 00:11:44 (25 sec),"Let's see how it all works out. But I'll tell you what, they're trying to destroy a very fine person. And we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. Democrats want activist, left-wing judges who will totally rewrite your laws, erase your borders, and replace your values. You don't want that in Tennessee."
00:11:44 - 00:12:05 (21 sec),Republicans know that a judge's job is to follow the law and to deliver equal justice for all. The Democrats can no longer be trusted with your power and with their power. You can't let it happen. They have moved so far left that Pocahontas is considered a conservative. True. That's right. Elizabeth Warren.
00:12:05 - 00:12:46 (41 sec),"She said she's considering a run for the presidency. Please, please run. How about that group, Biden? Biden. We call him 1 percent Biden. Until Obama took him off the trash heap, he couldn't do anything. Now he's talking about running. Tough guy. He's tough guy. He's -- he's a real genius. I want to challenge him to a fight behind the barn."
00:12:46 - 00:13:18 (32 sec),"Oh, would I love that? Wouldn't that be good? I want to challenge Donald Trump. Remember that? He got a little upset. He's another beauty. They got some real beauties going. This November 6th, you have the chance to reject the outrageous policies of the Democrat Party. Not the Democratic Party. But the Democrat Party."
00:13:18 - 00:13:48 (30 sec),"Sounds worse, right? But that's their real name. It's the Democrat Party. But you can only do it. You got to vote for Republican. We need more Republicans to get the votes. Stop the crime. You know, I said the other night, and I said, you know, I think I'm going to keep it. It's a little harsh, but I think I'll keep it. Democrats are the party of crime."
00:13:48 - 00:14:09 (21 sec),"How does that sound? They're the party of crime. Sounds a little tough, but it's true. Open borders. We're thrilled to be joined by many terrific Republican members of Congress, people that are friends of mine, people that have helped me, people that love your state and they love other states and they love our country."
00:14:09 - 00:14:34 (25 sec),"One of them is a man that everybody knows in this state very well. His name is Phil Roe. And he has really helped. Phil? Thank you, Phil. He's always there for you. Thank you, Phil. Another man said -- this is what I was Mr. Trump, not Mr. President -- I was here, he said, you know, we do early voting in Tennessee."
00:14:34 - 00:15:07 (33 sec),"He said, sir, I want to tell you that people are coming out of the mountains, out of the rivers, out of -- they're coming out of the valleys. They're coming -- they said -- right? They're coming out of everywhere. He said, I've never seen anything. I've been doing this stuff for 30 years more. And he said, this is what before -- you know, I'm waiting like we had, like, 30 days, but you have early voting in Tennessee."
00:15:07 - 00:15:32 (25 sec),"So I've never seen anything like it. People that haven't voted, because they haven't liked anybody. These are great people. These are great, incredible people. But they didn't exactly like what they had to go for. So they have a -- now they're coming out with Trump banners, Trump hats, Trump -- you know, make America great again."
00:15:32 - 00:15:57 (25 sec),"And this man -- he said, I can't speak for the rest of our nation, but if the nation's like Tennessee, you're going to win by a lot. And that's exactly what happened, right? John Duncan, Congressman, thank you, John. Where's John? Good. Thank you, John. He made me feel very good before the election. A friend of mine, a great congressman, somebody who's really worked hard."
00:15:57 - 00:16:22 (26 sec),"Even though he's not from your state, does it matter? He's just a great congressman. I see him here. He has been so strong, so smart. He loves this country so much, Congressman Mark Meadows. Thank you, Mark. And Deborah. Deborah, thank you, Deb. Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, who has been fantastic. Where's Chuck?"
00:16:22 - 00:16:48 (26 sec),"Chuck? Thank you, Chuck. Chuck has been great. Morgan Griffith, Scott DesJarlais -- my favorite name in politics. DesJarlais. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. You guys are great. These are really -- these are great people. You know, we don't have to devote a lot of time. I'm just -- these are great people. These are people that love our country."
00:16:48 - 00:17:17 (29 sec),"They want to do the right thing. You know, there's nothing wrong with having strong borders, strong law enforcement. You want to be safe. There's nothing wrong with paying low taxes. There's really nothing wrong. You want to have a strong military, especially in these times. You know, if you have a strong military, you're never going to have to use it. You're never going to have to use it. And we're going to very shortly have the strongest military we've ever had."
00:17:17 - 00:17:35 (18 sec),"We're also joined -- thank you, all -- we're also joined by future Republican members of Congress, Tim Burchett. Where's Tim? Tim? We got to get Tim in there. Tim? Thank you, Tim. John Rose, John, thank you, John. Mark Green, I hear they're up pretty good, but don't take any chances. Don't take any chances."
00:17:35 - 00:17:50 (15 sec),"You've got to go vote. Don't take any chances. We've got to get them in. But they're up pretty good. This is a hell of a state, I'll tell you that. These people... I also want to thank your great governor. I had dinner with him the other night. We were with a group of people. It was a fascinating dinner."
00:17:50 - 00:18:10 (20 sec),"He loves this state, also, and he's done a great job as governor, Governor Bill Haslam. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. Thank you. And Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally, thank you. Thank you, Randy. Great. Great job. Thank you. Great job. And very importantly, we have Tennessee's next governor, Bill Lee. And a man who did a fantastic job during the election for Trump."
00:18:10 - 00:18:30 (20 sec),"I will tell you, State Party Chairman Scott Golden. Thank you, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks. And, finally, the person we are here tonight to support. We cherish this person. She's a fighter. A true fighter for the people of Tennessee. She loves your state. And she's your next U.S. senator, she's going to be fantastic, Marsha Blackburn, Marsha, come up, please."
00:18:30 - 00:18:51 (21 sec),"There we go. Thank you all so much. [Audience Chants Marsha] Thank you. Mr. President, thank you for coming back to Tennessee. We love the president in Tennessee. And I want to say thank you to each of you for being here tonight. Thank you so much for all you are doing to elect all of these Republican candidates that we've talked about tonight."
00:18:51 - 00:20:03 (72 sec),"And thank you for sending Donald J. Trump to the White House. He has had an amazing 20 months. You've just heard some of those things. Not to even mention the foreign policy that he has achieved. Dealing with China, North Korea, getting us out of the Iran deal. And, Mr. President, we in Tennessee really appreciate that you moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem."
00:20:03 - 00:21:00 (57 sec),"Thank you for that. I know -- I know that the Democrats keep saying that there is a blue wave coming, but let me tell you something... Mr. President, when that blue wave gets to the state line, it is going to run smack dab into the great red wall. And that... And that is every single one of you. So if you want a U.S. senator who is going to stand with the president, build the wall, cut your taxes, and to make certain that we take care of our men and women in uniform, I am asking you to stand with me. Let's -- let's take these Tennessee values to Washington, D.C., and put them to work with President Donald Trump."
00:21:00 - 00:21:01 (1 sec),Thank you all. [Audience chants Marsha]
00:21:01 - 00:21:46 (45 sec),"So I just want to thank Marsha Blackburn. And I will you, she's all about Tennessee values. That's the one. She's got Tennessee values. A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for. It's a vote for make America great again. That's what it is. A vote for Bredesen is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... and the real leader of the Democrats, Maxine Waters."
00:21:46 - 00:22:15 (29 sec),"Phil Bredesen wants to raise your taxes. As governor, remember this -- you've got to remember -- seems like a nice guy, but what good does that do? As governor, he raised taxes and fees in your state by more than $1 billion. He opposes the border wall totally. He supported driver certificates for illegal aliens."
00:22:15 - 00:23:30 (75 sec),"And on his watch, Tennessee unemployment doubled. It doubled in the -- whatever it was. How long was he there? Eight? It doubled. You want him to be running -- I don't think so. I don't think so. He doubled unemployment. In 2010, Phil wrote a book advocating government-run health care. That's what you want?"
00:23:30 - 00:24:17 (47 sec),"You want to wait on line for about six weeks to get taken care of? And called for it to be funded by a 20 percent payroll tax on all of the hard-working Americans, many are in this room right now. Government-run health care. No, I don't think so. That hasn't proven too successful anywhere else. Phil was a major financial supporter of President Obama and of Hillary -- crooked Hillary Clinton."
00:24:17 - 00:24:57 (40 sec),"She's crooked as hell. Now Phil is running to be the 51st Senate Democrat and the 51st -- Democrats are elected in November, then Chuck Schumer will become a majority leader. You put in 51. Even though he said something good about our deal with Canada and Mexico today, but how can you not say good? That's why Schumer is so desperate for Phil to win, because everything that we stand for will never get the votes."
00:24:57 - 00:25:29 (32 sec),"We need votes. It's very important. Number one, Marsha will be a great, great senator, but, number two, we need the votes. We've got to have the vote. And he will never once vote for us. Just remember, he will never vote for us. Not on judges. You know, one of the reasons they say I got elected was that Supreme Court judge -- they always say the single most important thing that the president can do is the selection of a Supreme Court judge."
00:25:29 - 00:26:03 (34 sec),"OK. So we picked Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has been fantastic. And now Judge Brett Kavanaugh is actually doing well. I really believe -- we've got to do it. We cannot allow ourselves... to be pushed around. Phil is only running because Chuck Schumer called him up and begged him. The word is begged him to run because Schumer knows the Democrats' path to power runs right through Tennessee."
00:26:03 - 00:26:22 (18 sec),"Again, Second Amendment, higher taxes, lots of crime, MS-13, get used to them. No ICE. We don't want ICE, they say. If you want to stop Schumer from becoming majority leader, if you want to stop your taxes from going up 50 percent or more -- that's what's going to happen -- then you must vote against Bredesen."
00:26:22 - 00:27:07 (45 sec),"Your vote in this election will decide which party controls the Senate. That's how close it is. You know, I'd like to tell you no, but that's how close it is. A Democrat-controlled Senate will always be raising your taxes. They'll always throw open your border. There's nothing you can do. There's nothing he's going to do to change it. He's going to vote with the Democrats."
00:27:07 - 00:27:41 (34 sec),"There's not going to be -- I mean, you look at health care. We got no votes. Look at -- we gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of this country. We didn't get one Democrat vote. And they don't vote for a reason. They just vote because it's bad for Trump. In other words, they want to stop anything that we do. If it's really good, they still want to stop it. And we don't want to let that happen."
00:27:41 - 00:27:53 (12 sec),"We have unbelievable things planned, and we have to let it happen. Flood your streets. They're going to flood your streets with criminal aliens. That's what's going to happen."
00:27:53 - 00:27:55 (2 sec),We love you!
00:27:55 - 00:28:29 (34 sec),"They're always attacking law enforcement. I'll give you an example. Under the Obama administration, we have tremendous amounts of surplus military equipment. Right? Tremendous equipment. You know, heavy armor, lots of different things, that keep the law enforcement professionals, people that we love, that keeps them safe."
00:28:29 - 00:29:11 (42 sec),"They didn't want to give it them. I have given it to them. I'm sorry. They want to block your great judges. They want to weaken the military. They don't -- it's not even weaken. They don't want to spend any money on the military. You know, the beautiful thing about military -- number one, you need it. Everything's like jobs, jobs is very important to me. When it comes to the military, it's not the jobs."
00:29:11 - 00:29:32 (22 sec),"OK? That's totally secondary. But we will soon have the strongest military that we've ever had. We had fighter jets -- we had fighter jets and we had airplanes in our military where the father flew 'em, the grandfather flew 'em, and the son as a young pilot goes in, flying the same planes. You know what?"
00:29:32 - 00:30:01 (29 sec),"They're all going fast. We've ordered all incredible new, finest jets in the world. But the other thing is, they're made right here in the USA. All of them. Jobs, jobs, jobs. They want to outlaw private health insurance. So you'll get great health insurance, and we're already doing it. We're providing you with tremendous amounts of competition."
00:30:01 - 00:30:25 (24 sec),You're getting great health insurance and it's going to get better when we can get a few more votes so we can do it the way you want it. This is the way you want it. They want to shut down American energy and replace freedom with socialism. They want... They want to turn -- it's true -- the Democrats want to turn America into Venezuela.
00:30:25 - 00:30:49 (23 sec),"That'll be wonderful. That'll be wonderful. We're not going to let it happen. And you know what, even most Democrats -- I can't believe -- when you look at what they're doing with sanctuary cities and everything, I can't believe most of them are going for it. Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats in Washington want to raid Medicare to pay for their socialism."
00:30:49 - 00:31:10 (21 sec),"Democrats are pushing so-called medicine for all, robbing our seniors of all of their Medicare benefits. That's what's happening. Republicans want to protect Medicare and our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it. And we always protect Americans with their pre-existing conditions. We're doing that."
00:31:10 - 00:31:42 (32 sec),"On pre-existing conditions, a lot of people think it's not a very Republican thing. It is now, and it has been for me. I want to take care of people with pre-existing conditions. We're doing well. We can do it. Democrats also want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens. Republicans want to protect public benefits."
00:31:42 - 00:32:09 (27 sec),"And we do. We want to protect benefits and public benefits for truly needy Americans, Americans that need help. Democrats want to abolish ICE. In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. And the Democrat Party supports sanctuary cities that unleash violent predators, like MS-13, into our communities."
00:32:09 - 00:32:31 (22 sec),"And remember what I said. It's the party of crime. Democrats -- they really are. You look at what they're doing. Even look at what they're doing in Congress. Even look at what they're doing with our laws, the way they treat our laws, the way they treat country. What they do in Congress. They are indeed the party of crime."
00:32:31 - 00:32:56 (25 sec),"Every day, innocent lives are stolen because of Democrat-supported immigrant policies. If you just take a look, you have immigration policies that are so bad, so dangerous. Just recently in California, an illegal alien with a sex crime conviction and other convictions had a prior deportation. They wanted to deport this person."
00:32:56 - 00:33:28 (32 sec),"They never did. He was convicted for killing a local football coach who leaves behind a wife and six beautiful kids. A pillar of the community. By the way, this is all over. You could go -- you could do this for days. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens."
00:33:28 - 00:33:54 (26 sec),"And Republicans proudly stand with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol, and we stand with law enforcement. This election in November is about safety, and it's also about prosperity. The prosperity of our country. We are doing things now that nobody believes. We are hitting numbers that nobody believes."
00:33:54 - 00:34:30 (36 sec),"Here are just some of our achievements since Election Day. Thank you. We've created over 4 million new jobs. Nobody thought that was possible, 4 million. And lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. We've added nearly 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. That wasn't supposed to happen. Remember when President Obama said you can't do manufacturing?"
00:34:30 - 00:34:53 (23 sec),"Magic wand, right? You'd need a magic wand. You don't need a magic wand. You need proper policies. You need a lot of things. You don't need a magic wand. Remember this. And you've heard me say it a lot. I'm very proud of it. African-American unemployment -- think of it -- African-American unemployment just reached the lowest level ever recorded."
00:34:53 - 00:35:29 (36 sec),"Right? Right? Right? After years of Democrats failing and abandoning African-Americans, Republicans are delivering for African-Americans like never before. We're doing the job. And you saw that the other night with Kanye West. How good was Kanye West? And Big Jim Brown. And so many others. We're supported by so many great folks."
00:35:29 - 00:36:04 (36 sec),"Jim Brown. Boy, we could use him on some of those teams right now, couldn't we? Couldn't we? Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment also reached all-time lows. Women's unemployment recently reached its lowest level in 65 years. That's going to be coming out soon. I think it'll be in history. And last week, I signed a groundbreaking new trade deal with South Korea that dramatically increases American exports."
00:36:04 - 00:36:29 (24 sec),"You remember that deal? Remember that deal? Hillary Clinton -- that was a Hillary deal -- she said we must have this deal with South Korea. It will create 250,000 jobs. And it did for South Korea, not for us. It created jobs for South Korea. We now have a good thing. Friend or foe? Friend or foe? Friend, OK. You never know."
00:36:29 - 00:36:56 (27 sec),"When you hear little noises like that, you say foe, get them out, right? But they're friends. We only have friends in Tennessee, I think. We're also entering new trade talks with the European Union, which, frankly, has treated us extremely badly, and with Japan. Japan sends us millions and millions of cars."
00:36:56 - 00:37:31 (35 sec),"And we're working on a trade deal. We're working on a trade deal. It will be fine. And we are cracking down on China's unfair and abusive trade practices. Got to do it. We've been losing $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 billion a year to China. No more. No more. Right. No more. Can't do it. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation."
00:37:31 - 00:38:04 (33 sec),"And we're doing it with American aluminum and we're doing it with American steel. And our steel is doing really well. Really well. To put more money in the pockets of Tennessee families, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in the history of our country. And we eliminated the core of Obamacare."
00:38:04 - 00:38:26 (22 sec),"We got rid of the individual mandate. It's gone. The worst part of our (inaudible) And as bad as those premiums are, we've kept the premiums down. We've done a lot of things. But we're trying to keep those premiums from the remnant of Obamacare down. But it will all get taken care of. We just need a few more votes."
00:38:26 - 00:38:53 (27 sec),"This year alone, we have successfully lowered your health insurance premiums in the state of Tennessee by 26 percent. That's not bad. Under the past administration, it was like a rocket ship going up. To help critically ill patients access life-saving treatments, we just passed something they've been trying to pass for 45 years."
00:38:53 - 00:39:18 (25 sec),"Right to try. You know what that is. Right to try. Right? I'm very proud -- Meadows helped with that one. And Phil helped with that one, right, Phil? Phil Roe. You guys all helped with that one. And Greg, right, Greg was good. Did a good job. You know, right to try, so somebody's terminally ill, and we have medicines that have great help, great future."
00:39:18 - 00:39:38 (20 sec),"They look good. They're very promising. But we had no right to give those medicines to somebody that's terminal, is going to die. They had no hope. If they had money, they traveled all over the world to find a cure, but yet we have the greatest doctors and the greatest medicine in the world here. But it would be years, three years, four years."
00:39:38 - 00:40:00 (22 sec),"We've reduced it. It used to be 14, 15 years. I think we have it down to three-and-a-half to four. Scott is doing a great job at the FDA. But... Forty-five years they've been trying to pass -- not as easy as it sounds. Not as easy as -- I will tell you, not that easy, but we got it passed. So now somebody's terminally ill."
00:40:00 - 00:40:24 (25 sec),"And if we have a drug that looks like it's possibly going to help, we can actually give it to those people. And you know what? Already we've had success. Some of these drugs are working. Some of these drugs are working. I'm very proud of it, right to try. Hopefully you don't have to use it, OK? I don't want you to have to use it, but you know what?"
00:40:24 - 00:40:41 (16 sec),"If you do, doesn't it make sense, instead of doing -- I mean, if you don't have the money, you just go home and you sit there and it's -- you lose hope, and if you do have money, you go all over the world trying to find a cure. So right to try, remember it. That was a big deal. We also passed veterans choice."
00:40:41 - 00:41:11 (30 sec),"Any veterans in the room? Yes. We do. Young veteran. Young. We just passed choice. That was 44 years they've been trying to pass choice, so that if you have to wait in line for 9 days, 30 days, 21 days, months, you don't do that anymore. If the line's big, and if you're unhappy with it, you go to a private doctor, they take care of you, and we paid the bill."
00:41:11 - 00:41:30 (19 sec),"It's better. And you save a lot of money. It's better. They've been trying to pass that one for many, many decades. They couldn't do it. We got it passed. We're good at passing things, right? We're good. We're good at passing things, right? Oh, look. Come here. Stand up, Phil Roe. Stand up. That's right."
00:41:30 - 00:42:04 (33 sec),"That's right, Phil. Man, no wonder they love you in Tennessee. Great, right? And another one, we just passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act, right? V.A. accountability. This is where you have employees at the V.A., Veterans Administration, who are terrible, who treat our great, great warriors who are troubled."
00:42:04 - 00:42:30 (26 sec),"They're not well. They're sadist. They steal. They rob. They do a lot of bad things, some of them. Some people are incredible. But we now have the right to go after them. We now have the right to fire them. The V.A. Accountability Act is a big thing. And just last week, I signed a record $716 billion funding bill for our military."
00:42:30 - 00:43:18 (48 sec),"And we are giving our troops the biggest pay raise they've had in over a decade. They deserve it. And I just withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal or disaster. And we've recognize the capital of Israel and opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. We've done -- we've done so much, as point after point."
00:43:18 - 00:43:50 (32 sec),"I will not do this to you, but look at this. Page after page after page after page after page. I mean, look at this. Created jobs, 4 million, created manufacturing, 600,000. I mean, you just go point after point -- each one is a major point. I mean, but we're not going to bore you. But nobody's done -- I'll tell you what."
00:43:50 - 00:44:33 (43 sec),"Nobody has done this much in their first two years or probably in any two years -- nobody has done what we as a -- not me, what we have done with the help of all of these people and all of those people. Nobody. True. Nobody has done what we've done. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:44:33 - 00:44:56 (22 sec),"And we've cut more regulations than any administration, whether it's two years, four years, eight years, 12 years, in one case. We have cut more than any president, any administration, in two years, and it's less than two years, we have cut more regulations. And yet we have crystal clean water. We have pure, beautiful air."
00:44:56 - 00:45:26 (31 sec),"We're into that -- also, folks, but you don't have to turn off all business and send business to foreign countries to get it. Under my administration, we are no longer apologizing for America. We are standing up for America. Standing up. And we're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Tennessee."
00:45:26 - 00:46:07 (41 sec),"And we are standing up very proudly for our flag and our national anthem. We are lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. We're building a future of safety and hope and opportunity. And every city and every community in every part of this great land is prospering like they really have never prospered before."
00:46:07 - 00:46:44 (36 sec),"You see what's happening. It's a beautiful thing to watch. That's why outside right now -- I hope they haven't left -- we put big screens out there for them -- but you have close to 20,000 people standing outside. In the great state of Missouri, you had a big, beautiful arena. I always say Madison Square Garden, less maybe 30 percent, OK? Big, beautiful arena."
00:46:44 - 00:47:08 (24 sec),"It was packed. And in Missouri, they had -- you saw it -- 45,000 people outside. Think of it. So something is happening. And by the way... By the way, Claire McCaskill, who is another disaster, is being soundly beaten, we hope. We hope. Missouri. Audience Member"
00:47:08 - 00:47:47 (40 sec),"Thank you. Thank you, 45,000. So we're fighting for the right of all children to have a safe home, a great school, a loving family and a ladder that raises them up to reach their highest dreams. Wouldn't that be nice? We're unleashing the power of faith. We need more faith in this country. The might of justice and the glory of freedom is what we're about."
00:47:47 - 00:48:15 (28 sec),"But to continue this incredible momentum, momentum like -- I don't know if you've ever had this in this country -- you know, I haven't been corrected. I said the 2016 election may have been the greatest election of all time. There's never been anything like this. And we had to fight the Democrats, but more difficult was fighting a very, very dishonest media."
00:48:15 - 00:48:56 (41 sec),"That was much more difficult. Fighting the media is tougher than fighting the Democrats, but they're equal partners. So you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican and vote for Marsha Blackburn and Bill Lee and all of the great Republicans that are running."
00:48:56 - 00:49:15 (19 sec),"Bill Lee, going to be a great governor. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation -- that's a big factor -- and more products made right here in the good, old USA. [Audience Chants USA]"
00:49:15 - 00:50:05 (50 sec),"Remember the old days we had signs on cars and little decals all over the place? It said made in the USA. Guess what? That's what's happening now. Made in the USA. It's coming back. It's a vote to reduce crime, respect law enforcement, and restore the rule of law. Very simple. It's a vote for strong borders, safe communities, and thriving families, and a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democratic politics of anger, destruction, chaos, and to come together as citizens, as patriots, and as Americans, come together as Americans."
00:50:05 - 00:50:29 (24 sec),"To everyone in this room tonight, to every citizen watching all across the land, and they do have a lot of those cameras rolling, unfortunately -- thank you. It's called -- you know what it's called? Earned media, and I earned it. That I will tell you. Earned media. Thank you very much for the earned media."
00:50:29 - 00:50:54 (25 sec),This is your time to choose. This is your time. It's the time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustration of the past. Look at what we've done. Look at what we've done in far less than two years. Look at what we've done. Nobody believes it. They don't believe it. They don't believe it. And they don't want to report it. So we report it ourselves.
00:50:54 - 00:51:47 (53 sec),"They don't want to report it. By the way, 15 percent of them are OK, 85 percent, no good. And it's also a choice of whether we continue forward into the unlimited promise of our future of this great land, this great country. We were losing our country. I've had so many people come up to me, great people, some of them strong and tough -- and, you know, these aren't emotional people -- they have tears in their eyes, say, Mr. President -- I saw one tonight, came up to me, a man, strong, tough cookie, I wouldn't want to fight him, OK? And he said Mr. President -- he's crying -- he said, thank you for saving our country."
00:51:47 - 00:52:06 (19 sec),"So many people say that. So many people. It is not up to the media to decide our fate. It is not up to the pollsters or the pundits -- although our polls are very good right now. They're going nuts with that one. They don't like it when we have good polls. So usually they make up phony polls, but that's OK. They're called repression."
00:52:06 - 00:52:34 (28 sec),"It's repression. Darling, you know the story. I say it a lot. Darling, I really like Donald Trump, but you know, he can't win because CNN did a poll. Hey, did those polls turn out to be wrong or what? But it's called repression. It's called repression. They're phony polls, just like fake news. They're phony, fake polls."
00:52:34 - 00:52:51 (17 sec),"But they said, darling, I really like that guy, but, you know, the polls say, according to some of the news, the media, because most people think it's legit, although that's changed a very lot. They said, darling, let's go to a movie and then we'll come home and watch our friend, Donald. He'll just -- oh, it's so sad what's happening."
00:52:51 - 00:53:08 (17 sec),"I mean, as an example, I heard, darling, that he's going to lose Texas. I heard that he's going to lose Utah. I heard he's going to lose Georgia. So sad. So sad. Well, you know, when Texas came out at 8 o'clock, they said, ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in Texas and the winner is Donald Trump."
00:53:08 - 00:53:47 (39 sec),"Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the great state of Utah and the winner is Donald Trump. Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the great state of Georgia and the winner is Donald Trump. You see, if it's close, they take hours and hours and days. But when you win a landslide, they do it -- that's when I kept hearing he could be in trouble in Texas."
00:53:47 - 00:54:09 (22 sec),"Yeah, I'd like -- I'd like to have trouble like that all the time. We love Texas. And Ted Cruz is starting to do really well in Texas now. And he is a friend of mine. He's doing really well. He's going to win by a lot. He's going to win by a lot. But we had a -- was that the greatest evening? Tell me. Go back two years, almost two years."
00:54:09 - 00:54:37 (28 sec),"Was that the greatest evening, like, ever? Was that, like, the greatest evening? Remember the board? And, boy, that center, that whole thing -- outside a little blue here, a little blue here -- did you see the red -- the whole thing is red? And by the end of the evening, nice guy, John King, his hand was trembling."
00:54:37 - 00:55:03 (26 sec),"He said, oh, oh, Wisconsin, that's been decades. Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. His hand was shaking. What does this mean? What does this mean? Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan, and you hear the people behind him, oh, no, oh, no, don't. Remember that? Remember Pennsylvania? Pennsylvania hadn't been won for many years by a Republican."
00:55:03 - 00:55:21 (18 sec),"It's a great state, great people. I thought we're going to do well there, I thought we were going to -- but all Republicans think they're going to do well in Pennsylvania and then they lose. So I thought we're going to do great in Pennsylvania. Do you remember? There was 1 percent of the vote left. If we lost every single vote, we win by a lot."
00:55:21 - 00:55:45 (24 sec),"They refused to announce it. They refused. They waited until, like, what time, 1 o'clock in the morning? I said, wait a minute, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot. Announce it. They wouldn't announce it. But they had to announce Wisconsin, Michigan. So nothing mattered. But that was one of the great evenings -- you know, that was one of the greatest rating evenings in the history of television, all because of you."
00:55:45 - 00:56:05 (21 sec),"That was a great evening for all of us. And hopefully, we're going to have another great evening in November and you're going to get Marsha in there, because that's so important, Marsha Blackburn. It's up to you to choose our future. It's up to you to choose prosperity and pride over socialism and decay."
00:56:05 - 00:56:51 (45 sec),"It's up to you on November 6th, right, November 6th, November 6th, 2018, loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We're returning power to the American people. That's what we campaigned on. This great state, the state of Tennessee, was forged through the sweat and sacrifice of tough pioneer men and women, tough people, good genes you have, good genes."
00:56:51 - 00:57:23 (32 sec),"This is the state of Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson, who continues to be on the $20 dollar bill. You know that? Andrew Jackson -- they actually -- you know, they were comparing what we did a year-and-a-half ago -- thank you -- I think it was good what he said -- we were comparing -- they were always comparing it to Ronald Reagan."
00:57:23 - 00:57:42 (18 sec),"Then as we went along, they were going -- then they actually started saying, no, the only one that we compare this one is Andrew Jackson. He had one wild election. And then they say, toward the end, and then with the big victory, they said, no, this was actually greater than even Andrew Jackson. And I'm a big Andrew Jackson fan."
00:57:42 - 00:58:09 (27 sec),"And I went to Andrew Jackson's home in Tennessee. And it was great. And it was special. And he was a tough cookie, and he was a great president, too. This state is the home to generations of proud Americans who defy dangers and brave the elements to defend their families, their country, and always to defend their values."
00:58:09 - 00:58:35 (26 sec),"This is what they do. They defend their values. They defend their families. What else do they defend? They defend our great American flag. Don't they defend that? They defend our flag. Just like the pioneers and patriots who came before us, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win."
00:58:35 - 00:59:16 (41 sec),"We're winning. We're winning. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never, ever back down like these people over here. They'll never back down. Like him. Like him. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory, victory, victory. Because, as you know, we are American."
00:59:16 - 01:00:00 (43 sec),"And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Tennessee. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:56 (57 sec),"Whoa, whoa. [Audience Chants USA] I love Ohio. It's great to be back in Ohio. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. This is a truly great state with thousands of hard-working, wonderful, beautiful American patriots. Beautiful. Under Republican leadership, America is being respected again. And all of those thousands of people that aren't under the shell that is standing out there, look at you."
00:00:56 - 00:01:40 (44 sec),"Look at you. They're getting very wet. Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you. There are thousands of people that can't see a thing. In other words, you're better at real estate than they are, but that's OK. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I'm really proud to report that earlier today we secured the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey."
00:01:40 - 00:02:09 (29 sec),"He is now free from jail and he is in the air, heading to Germany, where he'll get off for a brief check, and I think he's going to be in great shape. And then he's coming to Washington, D.C., tomorrow, and we'll say hello to him. Went through a lot, you know? All about Pastor Brunson. He went through a lot, but he's on his way back."
00:02:09 - 00:02:36 (28 sec),"We've done that with a lot, right? We've had a lot of success. North Korea, Egypt, remember? We bring a lot of people back, and that's good. They want to come back to our country, and they're coming back to our country. Tonight, every American heart is with our fellow citizens affected by Hurricane Michael."
00:02:36 - 00:03:00 (24 sec),"Sounds like a very nice name. That was a vicious hurricane. Whether it's in Florida or Georgia or Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, a lot of areas affected, but we just want to give everybody our love. That was a devastating power that hit -- among the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit our country."
00:03:00 - 00:03:33 (33 sec),"It was devastating. But they'll rebuild. They're strong. They're great people. And just God bless you all. Thank you. My administration has been in constant communication with the state and local authorities all over the various states. When we're in trouble, we pull together, we pull together like nobody."
00:03:33 - 00:04:09 (35 sec),"We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary achievements that we've made together in -- can you believe it -- less than two years? It's been Republican leadership and we are here to make sure that our amazing progress continues full speed ahead. Because America is booming. America is thriving. And America is winning, really winning again."
00:04:09 - 00:04:51 (42 sec),And we are viewing now for the first time in many decades a phenomenon called so simply America first. And it's about time. It's about time. Right? About time. It's about time. The unemployment rate has just fallen to the lowest level in more than 50 years. Manufacturing confidence just announced has reached an all-time high.
00:04:51 - 00:05:33 (43 sec),"Think what that matters. Think what that is, confidence, confidence. The people of Ohio have confidence. Can tell you that. No, but think of it. If you remember the previous administration said manufacturing jobs... Other than that, you like them very much, right? But remember, they said manufacturing jobs, they're gone, they're dead."
00:05:33 - 00:06:02 (29 sec),"Remember the expression, you'd need a magic wand to bring them -- bring them back? We're bringing them back. I guess we have the magic wand. They're coming back. And they're coming back from Mexico, they're coming back from Canada, they're coming back from everywhere, because they all want to be where the action is. They all want to be in the USA."
00:06:02 - 00:06:59 (57 sec),"That's where we want to be. That's where the jobs are. We are now the hottest country anywhere in the world. All across... [Audience Chants USA] By the way, I wish the cameras would get this crowd. This crowd is incredible. Look at the cameras back there. It's like the Academy Awards. Look at this. How would you like to have to do this every night?"
00:06:59 - 00:07:43 (43 sec),"No, no, how would you like to have to do this every night? And one little mistake, one little mistake and they try to destroy your entire career. Boy. No, I mean, look at this. Seriously, look at -- look at the magnitude of it. Look at the number of the media back there. Look at that. Fake news. Fake news."
00:07:43 - 00:08:13 (30 sec),"Fake. You go back and they'll say, did he say -- did he say this? Or that? Or this? That's OK. You know what, we've learned how to live with them. We've learned how to live with them. We don't like it, but we've learned. All across Ohio, steel mills are reopening, and we are putting our coal miners back to work."
00:08:13 - 00:08:40 (27 sec),"One of the things we're most proud of - look, steel was dead. Steel was dead. I came into office, steel was a dead business. Now they're opening up plans, U.S. Steel, Nucor. They're opening up plants all over the country, big ones, new ones. We're taxing the hell out of the dumpers. You know, you had the dumpers that were hurting your steel industry?"
00:08:40 - 00:09:07 (27 sec),"And you know what happens? After the industry dies -- would have died within two years. After it dies, they would come in and they would charge you three times more money. Nobody says it, but that's what happens. So we're going to have beautiful new American-made steel... It's not going to be mud or it's not going to be sand steel."
00:09:07 - 00:09:35 (27 sec),"You know they put garbage in this stuff they were dumping. We don't even know what's in it. It's going to be U.S. steel. It's going to be American steel. We're going to get the iron ore from our mines, right, beautiful. They're opening up again. Our mines are opening up again. Metallurgic coal, but our miners are back to work."
00:09:35 - 00:10:16 (42 sec),"We don't need outsiders telling us about our steel industry. It's incredible. Seriously, it's incredible what's happened. It's hot as a pistol. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation, which is what we want. And this has been... [Audience Chants USA] So this has been a really historic week for America."
00:10:16 - 00:10:53 (37 sec),"Really historic. And by the way, our magnificent first lady, Melania... just returned from an incredibly successful trip to Africa. It was an incredible trip. And she came back, and she told me so beautiful, so beautiful, and yet such incredible in some cases poverty. They need help. They definitely need help."
00:10:53 - 00:11:21 (28 sec),"It's both beautiful and sad. It's got every kind of emotion. But you probably saw her travels. They were really incredible. And it opens your eyes to what's going on around the world. You're all very lucky in Ohio. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. Thank you. And on Monday night in the East Room of the White House, we achieved a tremendous victory for our nation, our freedom, and our Constitution."
00:11:21 - 00:12:09 (48 sec),"America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Did he get treated badly and unfairly or what? Horrible. And I'll tell you what. He's done us a tremendous service, what -- the way they treated him, I've never seen anybody treated like that."
00:12:09 - 00:12:38 (29 sec),"But he's done us a great service, because we are more energized as Republicans that ever -- I think ever before. I think ever before. We just got poll numbers for some of the Senate races. And you look at some of these Senate races where we weren't even going to contest. It's a Democrat that's in. We were figuring in -- you know, we're winning with candidates that are -- we're winning."
00:12:38 - 00:13:22 (44 sec),"We're beating people that we weren't going to contest. So it's been amazing. Because people realize how important the Supreme Court is. And we could have two, three, maybe even four more choices, and we have to be able to get the votes to put them through. Go out and vote November 6th. From the moment Brett Kavanaugh was announced, an angry Democrat mob was on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy him."
00:13:22 - 00:13:51 (29 sec),"And before they even know -- I'll tell you, you saw it. Before they knew his name, they were saying horrible things. They didn't even know who was going to be the pick. He wasn't picked. I didn't know who was going to be the pick. And they were saying horrible, horrible things. These are bad people. We can't let this happen to our country."
00:13:51 - 00:14:24 (33 sec),"Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob. That's what it is. It's a mob. The people of Ohio can save America from radical Democrats. They've become radicalized. I mean, Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, seriously... No, no, seriously, she's becoming mainstream. You believe that one? We have to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate."
00:14:24 - 00:14:58 (34 sec),"We need the votes. We need the votes. And, by the way, for the people of Ohio, early voting starts right now. You got to get out. Vote early. And then anybody that votes early, you can leave. The hell with you. That's -- you know, I worked in Cincinnati, Ohio, two summers. I loved Ohio. I loved Ohio. I shouldn't tell you this, but I used to travel a lot to Kentucky."
00:14:58 - 00:15:36 (38 sec),"Does anybody travel to Kentucky? Right? No, I -- I like Kentucky. But I traveled to Kentucky when I spent a lot of time in the Queen City. I love the Queen City. We had a job, Swifton Village, Swifton. Does anyone ever hear of Swifton? And it was a great experience. It was a successful experience. I did it with my father, one of my earliest things that I've done, and I guess it's sort of like if you get your first up as a hit, you're a hitter, you hit, you sink the 10-foot putt on the first hole."
00:15:36 - 00:16:10 (34 sec),"But we had a great success in Ohio, and I've never forgotten it. And then they said -- remember, for months before the election, you cannot win without getting the great state of Ohio. Right? And I got the great state of Ohio. And I love the great state of Ohio. We got it. We got it. Remember? They used to say that every time."
00:16:10 - 00:16:36 (26 sec),"I used to hear it. I have fantastic people in Ohio that did a job for me. Bob Paduchik, where's Bob? I had just a great group of people. They did incredible work. But they constantly would say on these phony networks, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio. And then they started doing polls, and I was way up. And I think we won it by 9 or 10 points."
00:16:36 - 00:17:12 (36 sec),"A lot. We won it by a lot. In fact, you know the way, if it's close, they have to take hours and hours and hours, right? So with Ohio, I'll never forget, they said the polls have closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. Crazy. We won Ohio by so much that it took one second before they called it, OK? We won by a lot."
00:17:12 - 00:17:46 (34 sec),"It's a great place. And by the way, have I produced? Look at what's coming into Ohio now. Have we produced? I produced and you produced. If Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats... take control, they will try to raise your taxes, impose socialism on this country, take away your health care, and take away your jobs."
00:17:46 - 00:18:13 (27 sec),"We have more people working now than ever before. They want to take away -- that's what will happen. The Democrats want to erase America's borders and let drugs, gangs and crime pour into our country. In fact, I've been going around lately saying the Democrats are the party of crime. And nobody even challenges me, not even the fake news media."
00:18:13 - 00:18:48 (35 sec),"They don't even challenge me. Republicans are the party of safety and Republicans are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. And that's what's happened. And we're honored to be joined tonight by many terrific Ohio Republicans, including Republican Party Chair -- I have to say, this woman is incredible, because, you know, I got dropped just before the election by the head of the Republican Party."
00:18:48 - 00:19:31 (42 sec),"I've never been dropped in my life. And a woman came in who is a very successful person with a great family. And she took that thing over. What a job she's done. Her name is Jane Timken, and she is very special. Where's Jane? She's incredible. Thank you very much. And a man who said, oh, you're going to win, you're going to win, and I said, well, how do you know?"
00:19:31 - 00:19:56 (26 sec),"So I had five people to choose from to head up my campaign in Ohio. And one name, I don't know, I liked the name, I liked the sound of it, his name was Bob Paduchik. Why do I like that name? Why? It's not outstanding. But he came in and he did a job, and I had the support of the people, but not the support of a lot of others."
00:19:56 - 00:20:16 (20 sec),"And he just said, you're going to win. And every time I called him up and say, you know, this happened, that happened, he said, that's OK, you're going to win by more. This guy's the most positive guy. So I want to thank Bob Paduchik. So good that we moved him over to the RNC, but, Bob, in about a year from now, get ready."
00:20:16 - 00:20:50 (34 sec),"You're coming back here. Thank you, Bob. And we have a friend of mine who's an incredibly respected man in the United States Senate. When he speaks, we all listen, including the president. He really is. He's a great, great guy. He's loved in Ohio. Senator Rob Portman. Where is he? Thank you. He's a respected guy."
00:20:50 - 00:21:15 (25 sec),"Thank you, Rob. Congressman Warren Davidson and Congressman Brad Wenstrup, thank you. Thank you, fellas. Great job. So many things we passed in Congress. Those two guys were there with us. Thank you very much. What a job they've done. We're also joined by your next lieutenant governor Jon Husted. Jon, thank you."
00:21:15 - 00:22:01 (46 sec),"Thank you, Jon. And I hear you're up a little bit, Jon. We've got to get that over, because you're going against a very bad guy. I'll tell you, he's a bad guy. And everybody -- I'll tell you, Jon is with a friend of mine, and they decided to get together, which is very smart. Instead of going like this to each other, they got together, and Jon is running with your next governor, Mike DeWine... And Mike and Jon are running against Elizabeth Warren's far-left disciple, Richard Cordray."
00:22:01 - 00:22:33 (32 sec),"Jon, am I allowed to say some bad things about Cordray? Because let me tell you, he did such a bad job at the agency that he ran. It was terrible. He was hurting people. And I think he enjoyed it. No, really. I really believe he enjoyed it. He was putting people out of business. They weren't loaning money to the people that they were supposed to. It was terrible."
00:22:33 - 00:23:09 (36 sec),"Cordray spent $250 million federal dollars trying to renovate a headquarters, his agency, that they didn't even own, more than twice what the entire building was worth. They didn't own it. And then it became a big scandal. But because it was a Democrat, the fake news didn't want to write about it. Then after spending like $50 million on some elevators, it turned out that they didn't work."
00:23:09 - 00:23:30 (22 sec),"If Cordray were ever -- and I'll tell you what, this is a Pocahontas dream to get this guy elected. [Audience Laughs] I can't believe -- you know, I know Ohio pretty well, right? I've done a lot for the steel industry. More than anybody's done in many, many -- I mean, you speak to U.S. Steel, they'll tell you."
00:23:30 - 00:23:57 (27 sec),"A lot for the miners, a lot for everybody. This guy does not belong in the state, folks. OK? First of all, he's a super liberal. Why do you do that? Why do you do that -- is he -- OK, go with DeWine, please. And Jon. Cordray would be an absolute disaster for Ohio. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing."
00:23:57 - 00:24:36 (39 sec),"I couldn't wait to get him out. We tried so hard. You know, you had one of these deals that you couldn't get him out. But we tried so hard. And they've done such a great job since we got him out. He was bad. You don't need him in Ohio. Now, I'm thrilled to introduce the next United States senator from Ohio, Jim Renacci, who's a great guy and a great friend of mine."
00:24:36 - 00:24:47 (11 sec),"Jim, come up. Come up. Come. This is a good man. Nothing's easy about politics, but I'll tell you what, he's in there fighting, and just get out and vote for him. He is a good, good friend of mine and a good man."
00:24:47 - 00:25:27 (40 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. It's an honor to stand here with you tonight, like I stood with you 31 months ago when you were candidate Trump, and I told you I am with you. I told you I voted for you. I told you my wife voted for you, my family voted for you, my friends voted for you. Because we needed you to change Washington, and you haven't let me down."
00:25:27 - 00:26:13 (47 sec),"Look, this crowd loves you. Ohio loves you. And we love what you're doing! You've got the Ohio economy growing. Unemployment is down. Wages are up. The tax cut and jobs bill is working in Ohio. You have two Supreme Court judges confirmed and more circuit judges confirmed than any other president. You've repealed the individual mandate that was hurting so many individuals here in Ohio, renegotiated NAFTA, helping Ohio business, passed right to try."
00:26:13 - 00:27:06 (53 sec),"ISIS is on the run. And you have given our coal miners here in Ohio hope by reversing those devastating policies of the prior administration that had vowed to bankrupt that industry. Promises kept -- promises made, promises kept. Look, Mr. President, we are not tired of winning here in Ohio. And yet you've been able to do all that with no help from Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown."
00:27:06 - 00:27:39 (33 sec),"He has fought you every turn, voting against the tax bill, voting against coal miners, voting against your judges' confirmations. You asked for help, and that's why I jumped in this race seven months ago. And I am here to help, just like Ohio, everyone here is here to help. Sherrod Brown votes 96 percent of the time with Chuck Schumer and 94 percent of the time with Elizabeth Warren."
00:27:39 - 00:28:35 (56 sec),"Yet he voted 100 percent of the time with President Obama's judge appointments. He supported Hillary Clinton for president. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up] And -- and even though -- and even though you are ripping up those trade agreements that aren't working for Ohio, Senator Brown had the gall just a month ago to say the only thing President Trump has done for trade policy is run his mouth and line his pockets."
00:28:35 - 00:29:09 (34 sec),"That's the type of guy who is not helping this president. Sherrod Brown is the fourth most liberal senator in the country. That's not Ohio. That's not even close to the average American. He votes like a Hollywood liberal, and he has received the most lobbyist money in the Senate, more than any other senator, he has received the most lobbyist dollars."
00:29:09 - 00:29:54 (45 sec),"Look, it's time we send Sherrod Brown packing. And it's time we send me to Washington. Someone that's willing to help this president... [Audience Chants Drain the Swamp] In 25 days... In 25 days, in just 25 days, we need to retire Sherrod Brown. We need a red wave. We need a red -- not only a red wave -- and I said this earlier."
00:29:54 - 00:30:08 (14 sec),"Mr. President, Ohio is going to deliver a red tsunami. Thank you for what you're doing, Mr. President. And thank you for what you've done for Ohio. Thank you."
00:30:08 - 00:30:41 (32 sec),"Thank you. Thanks, Jim. It is true. Sherrod Brown's never voting for us. He didn't vote for anything that we want. Yet I hear he goes around -- he does the best commercials. In fact, I just want to think, is he a Republican? He's doing these commercials that he likes Donald Trump. He'll never vote for us. He didn't vote for Justice Kavanaugh."
00:30:41 - 00:31:36 (55 sec),"He didn't vote for tax cuts. He doesn't vote for us, folks. I mean, it might be nice for him to say he agrees with my economic policy when he's never going to vote for it. So you're just kidding yourself. He voted yes on amnesty for illegal aliens. He voted yes on deadly sanctuary cities. We started building the wall, and we've made progress, but he voted against it. [Audience Chants Build the Wall] So illegal immigration takes American lives, American jobs, and American taxpayer dollars."
00:31:36 - 00:32:02 (26 sec),"A border wall, which is moving faster than anybody would believe... is truly a life-saving barrier against deadly floods of drugs, crime, smugglers, traffickers, cartels. Our brave border agents want a wall. They need a wall. It's happening. It's moving. We have made so much progress. We will finish the wall."
00:32:02 - 00:32:39 (37 sec),"If you want more jobs and less crime, if you want to stop Schumer from running the Senate... we need the vote of Jim Renacci. We do. Jim is a good person. He's a great guy. We need his vote! You know they say we have a majority. But if somebody has a cold, they can't come in, we don't have a majority anymore."
00:32:39 - 00:33:00 (21 sec),"We got to get people. We've got to get some Republicans so we can vote. Finally, it's my privilege to introduce a tremendous Ohio Republican. We're here for him tonight. A great friend of mine, he's fought so hard for everything we've done. He's a true fighter for the state, Congressman Steve Chabot. Great guy."
00:33:00 - 00:33:00 (1 sec),"Come up, Steve. Come up, Steve."
00:33:00 - 00:33:58 (57 sec),"Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President. And God bless Warren County! All right, yeah, all right. And God bless Hamilton County, too. I have Hamilton County. And Butler County, as well, and the Kentuckians. Oh, God bless you all. And God bless President Trump! Thank you. And I never knew I'd say this."
00:33:58 - 00:34:26 (28 sec),"But God bless Kanye West! Hey, you know -- you know how many liberals it takes to screw in a light bulb? None, because they'd prefer to stay in the dark, so... [Audience Laughs] Let me just -- let me just say, I got like a -- I got about a six-page speech here. I decided the more Steve Chabot you get, the less President Trump you're going to get, so I'm not going to give this speech."
00:34:26 - 00:34:43 (17 sec),"God bless you all, and God bless the President Trump!"
00:34:43 - 00:35:19 (37 sec),"Thank you, Steve. So just remember, a vote for Steve Chabot is a vote to protect your family, your jobs, and your country. Now, Steve's winning. Nice poll numbers. But don't take any chances. Get out and vote, please, OK? No chances. We don't want to hear about any upsets. He's a great, great guy. If you want to stop the radical Democrats, if you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker -- can you believe it -- and you have to get out and vote for Steve."
00:35:19 - 00:35:56 (37 sec),"Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats have signed up for a socialist takeover of American health care that would utterly destroy Medicare and Rob our seniors of the benefits they paid into their entire lives. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and they've paid for it. And the Democrats want radical socialism, and they want open borders where everybody pours into our country."
00:35:56 - 00:36:25 (29 sec),"It's what they want. I don't get it, but that's what they want. Does anybody want that? Open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. Think of that. I'll tell you what, the incredible men and women of ICE are not treated properly. They're not treated properly. They do an incredible job."
00:36:25 - 00:36:59 (34 sec),"The Democrats want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens, MS-13 killers, and anybody else that wants to come in. We're not going to have it. We're not going to have it. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. This election is about safety and is about prosperity."
00:36:59 - 00:37:24 (25 sec),"Since the election, which is incredible. If I would have said this, I've been to Ohio so many times, been to every part of Ohio. The people are great. But if I would have said this, the fake news would have said, how dare he say that. Since the election, we've created over 4.2 million new jobs... and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps."
00:37:24 - 00:37:58 (33 sec),"Big deal. That's a big deal. We've added nearly 600,000 brand-new beautiful manufacturing jobs. Right? African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in the history of our country. And African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever, lowest rate ever. My -- that's a big number, right?"
00:37:58 - 00:38:24 (26 sec),"How do they beat that number? How does anybody beat that number? We're going to have these people come in. For over 100 years, they've claimed and they've wanted and they've said -- they've lied to African-Americans. Remember my statement, what do you have to lose? Guess what? They all believe it now. What do you have to lose?"
00:38:24 - 00:38:52 (28 sec),"They're doing -- we are doing great as a country. But I'm so proud -- I am so proud of the kind of numbers you're hearing. My administration is fighting every day to deliver safety, opportunity, and justice for everybody, for everybody. We're asking as an example all African-American voters to honor us with their support this November."
00:38:52 - 00:39:27 (35 sec),"Get away from the Democrats. Get away from the Democrats. They've done nothing. They've done nothing. Think of it. We have the best numbers in history on employment and unemployment and median income and many other things. And I think we're going to get the African-American vote. And it's true. Kanye West, what he did was pretty amazing yesterday."
00:39:27 - 00:40:04 (37 sec),"Pretty amazing. And you know who else was with him? A guy you know well, big Jim Brown. Big Jim. What do you think Big Jim would be making today in the NFL? He was unstoppable, right? Unstoppable Jim Brown. He was a great football player and is an even greater man. He's great. Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans likewise have the lowest unemployment in the history of our country."
00:40:04 - 00:40:50 (46 sec),"And women unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is soon to be changed to historic levels, but right now, I'm sorry, it's the lowest in 65 years, OK? Sorry! Sorry, women! I let the women down. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning, right? Tired of winning. Last week, I announced that we are replacing the horrendous NAFTA -- NAFTA was a disaster, folks -- NAFTA was a disaster -- with the incredible, brand-new, U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, the USMCA."
00:40:50 - 00:41:27 (37 sec),"It's opening up Canada, opening up Mexico for our farmers, our -- everybody. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's unfair trade actions and trade abuses. And thanks to our tariff, and especially on steel that's been dumped all over this country, the Ohio steel industry and the U.S. steel industry is roaring back to life and soon will be hitting its most successful years ever."
00:41:27 - 00:41:59 (32 sec),"Very serious. And you see it. You see it all over this state. Under Republican leadership, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. And by the way, Sherrod Brown voted against them. We reduced high-dose opioid prescriptions by 16 percent during my first year and now they're dropping much lower than that."
00:41:59 - 00:42:57 (57 sec),"And I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress -- thanks to Rob Portman and a lot of others -- thank you, Rob -- but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support. We also passed veterans' choice, the V.A. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor and the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans, who we couldn't fire, we couldn't do anything about it, we now look at them and say, Jim, you're fired."
00:42:57 - 00:43:42 (45 sec),"Out. Get out. True. True. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion for the second year to fully rebuild the American military, which had to happen. We needed it. And much less importantly, when it comes to the military, every bit of equipment is being built in the USA. That's the only place where jobs are secondary."
00:43:42 - 00:44:15 (33 sec),"Number one, we needed the equipment. But it's all being built here. We make the greatest military equipment in the world. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force. Very important. Very important. That's very important. Hate to say it, but very soon, that's where it's going to be at. It's going to be space, everything, defense, offense, everything."
00:44:15 - 00:44:41 (26 sec),"And we have tremendous support from Rob and the Senate. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal, and look what happened to Iran. You know, when I took office, Iran was all over the place. They were taking over Syria. They were taking over Yemen. They were taking over everything."
00:44:41 - 00:45:07 (26 sec),"I actually said, this is going to be a problem, and we've got to do something. And about four months ago, we withdrew from that horrible, ridiculous deal. And you take a look what's happening to Iran. There's riots all over the streets, all over the cities. It's a whole different ballgame. It's a whole different country."
00:45:07 - 00:45:52 (45 sec),"And it's looking real good. Looking real good. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and reopened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together, we've made unbelievable progress, and we're just getting started. We have so many other things. If you vote to elect Republican House, Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes very, very substantially."
00:45:52 - 00:46:43 (51 sec),"We will protect Medicare and we will protect your Social Security. The Democrats cannot do it. We will continue to confirm judges who interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass case law, crack down on sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery and chain migration, defend the ballot box for American citizens, and throw vicious MS-13 gangs the hell out of our country, like we're doing right now."
00:46:43 - 00:47:04 (21 sec),"You know, I say it to people, MS-13 gang, vicious, horrible people. We're throwing them out of here by the thousands. But you know who's doing it? Do we love law enforcement or what? But you know who's... But ICE, in Long Island, where I sort of grew up -- I was right next to these areas. I know them so well."
00:47:04 - 00:47:27 (22 sec),"You had towns that were practically taken over by MS-13. And ICE goes in like it's a day in the office. And they're tougher and smarter that these wise guys. And they start throwing them in the paddy wagon, throwing them in, get the hell out of here. And you know what? The towns are liberated. The people are clapping from windows."
00:47:27 - 00:47:55 (28 sec),"The people are clapping all over the streets. These towns, like a country that was invaded and taken over and then was liberated. These towns are being liberated of the MS-13 garbage that came into our country. Under the previous administration, by the way. And they came in by the tens of thousands -- well, we have set every record on getting them out."
00:47:55 - 00:48:20 (25 sec),"And I want to tell you, there's nothing that gives me more pleasure. And for all of the companies that are moving back in to the United States, we will finally have a merit-based system of immigration. Not just lump -- not a lottery, pick them out of a hat. Who the hell are they? Who is he? Pick them out of a hat."
00:48:20 - 00:48:40 (20 sec),"We're letting people come in on merit, where they can help you, where they can help these companies grow. Right now, we have a system, lottery, a lottery. Think of it, lottery. Oh, pick 'em, I wonder? What people do you think these countries are putting in? Do you think they're putting in their finest? I don't think so. I don't think so. So we're going to end it. We're going to have a merit-based system."
00:48:40 - 00:49:02 (22 sec),"Bring them in through merit. We're lifting millions of people from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. And you see that happening. But to achieve this, you have to get out November 6th or vote early and vote Republican. We need the votes. We have to have those votes. For years and years, you've watched as your leaders apologized for America."
00:49:02 - 00:49:23 (21 sec),"They apologized for America. Now you finally have a president who is standing up for America. [Audience Chants USA] I have to tell you, I wish these fakers back there, the fake news, I wish they'd turn the cameras and show behind them, show outside these walls. Look at the people out there. It's amazing."
00:49:23 - 00:50:48 (84 sec),"Look, they never turn the cameras. I go home, I say to my wife, how did the crowd look? They only show your face. They never move the camera. But you know what? She can tell by the sound, because... True. She can tell by the sound, because, you know, if you have, like, let's say, one of the normal presidents walk in. We've had a lot of normals."
00:50:48 - 00:51:22 (35 sec),"And some great ones. You'd have, what, 300 people show up. But you can tell by the sound, because 300 people cannot make the sound of thousands and thousands and tens of thousands like that. They can't do it. So even though they refuse -- you know, normally I'd like it, but I don't. They don't want to move the camera."
00:51:22 - 00:51:43 (21 sec),"The only ones that become famous are about six people right behind me. [Audience Laughs] They don't have the best seat in the house, but they're going to become the famous ones. No, but, honestly, you know, I know what stadiums sound like, and this sounds like on television we're in the middle of an Ohio State football game."
00:51:43 - 00:52:42 (59 sec),"It's what it sounds like. It's what it sounds like. And speaking of Ohio State -- they're not doing too badly, are they, huh? Great coach. You have a great coach, great guy. Great guy. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Ohio. And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. But to continue our momentum, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and vote Republican, vote early or on November 6th, vote Republican."
00:52:42 - 00:53:18 (35 sec),"Vote for Steve Chabot, Jim Renacci. Vote for DeWine. We need DeWine. We got to have DeWine. Where the hell is Jon? Are you over there, Jon? He's still here. He'll never leave. You got to vote. We need a governor here -- you cannot let this happen to Ohio. This Democrat is a disaster. A proven disaster. Vote DeWine."
00:53:18 - 00:53:48 (30 sec),"He's a good man, and a good man, too. You've got two good men. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, more products made right now in the USA, which is what we're all about. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement."
00:53:48 - 00:54:17 (29 sec),"Thank you, law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division. You've seen that. You just saw it with a high-quality, highest quality, this incredible man. You saw it. Brett Kavanaugh, you saw it, what they did to him and his family. And his young, beautiful daughters."
00:54:17 - 00:55:00 (43 sec),"Right? Da Nang Dick, Da Nang Dick, how about Da Nang? Da Nang Dick. Cory Booker, he ran Newark into the ground. Senator Dianne Feinstein, how about that? How about that? Seriously. [Audience Chants Lock her up] Who think that Dianne Feinstein leaked the papers? Who thinks... She was very unprepared for that question."
00:55:00 - 00:55:35 (36 sec),"No, I didn't -- she was very unprepared, right? Very unprepared. Dianne Feinstein. You know, what they did to this man, he will go down along with Justice Gorsuch -- and, by the way, how good is Clarence Thomas? How good? How good? He's going to go down as one of your greats. It's up to the people in this incredible -- I don't know if you call it a room."
00:55:35 - 00:56:05 (30 sec),"I don't know what the hell it is. All I know -- is this a room or a roof? I think it's a roof. Whatever it is, there are a lot of people. But it's up to you, folks. You have the power with your vote to defend your family, your country, your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity. So we had the greatest movement in the history of our country."
00:56:05 - 00:56:35 (30 sec),"We really did. We really did. You know, they can say what they want, but nobody even challenges it. You know, I'll say that a lot. And usually, if there's, like, a 2 percent variation, the fake news will hit me the next day. Trump exaggerated or something. Actually, we've under-exaggerated, because we've produced more than I ever promised during the campaign."
00:56:35 - 00:56:57 (21 sec),"More. But we had the greatest -- but look at the -- look at this. Look at this group. We had the greatest -- and we never -- by the way, I hate to disappoint you, but we went to Mississippi, we went to Missouri, we went to Nevada, we went to -- every place, and we have crowds, we have tens of thousands of people outside of every arena."
00:56:57 - 00:57:19 (22 sec),"They have to start building larger arenas in this country, right? Something is happening. And I saw this in the election. We'd go -- I'll never forget -- we went to Michigan, final stop. I got there 1 o'clock in the morning. There was actually Election Day, 1 o'clock in the morning. There were 32,000 people."
00:57:19 - 00:57:45 (26 sec),"I see some people there, they were there. It was unbelievable, 32,000 people. I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning. I got home at 4 o'clock in the morning. And I said, you know, we had 32,000. Crooked Hillary had, like, 500. And I said, why aren't we going to win the great state of Michigan? And guess what?"
00:57:45 - 00:58:18 (33 sec),"We did. We did. And it hadn't been won in decades by a Republican. And now they like me even more. You know why? Because car companies are moving plants back in. And just so you don't feel too lonely, they're moving the plants back into Ohio also. A lot of them. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country."
00:58:18 - 00:58:57 (39 sec),"And together we are taking back our country. We're returning the power back to the incredible American people. Ohio is the state that gave us a great president who hasn't been properly recognized, OK? William McKinley has not been properly recognized. What he did in terms of trade, in terms of war, but in terms of trade -- and I hate to say, in terms of being smart in tariffs, William McKinley has not been properly recognized."
00:58:57 - 00:59:27 (30 sec),"But maybe someday he will. It also gave you a general, who was incredible. He drank a little bit too much. You know who I'm talking about, right? So Robert E. Lee was a great general. And Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia. He couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. He was going crazy. I don't know if you know this story."
00:59:27 - 00:59:48 (21 sec),"But Robert E. Lee was winning battle after battle after battle. And Abraham Lincoln came home, he said, I can't beat Robert E. Lee. And he had all of these generals. They look great. They were the top of their class at West Point. They were the greatest people. There was only one problem. They didn't how the hell to win."
00:59:48 - 01:00:14 (27 sec),"They didn't know how to fight. They didn't know how. And one day, it was looking really bad. And Lincoln just said, you -- hardly knew his name -- and they said, don't take him. He's got a drinking problem. And Lincoln said, I don't care what problem he has, you guys aren't winning. And his name was Grant."
01:00:14 - 01:00:51 (37 sec),"General Grant. And he went in and he knocked the hell out of everyone. And you know the story. They said to Lincoln, you can't use him anymore. He's an alcoholic. And Lincoln said, I don't care if he's an alcoholic. Frankly, give me six or seven more just like him. He started to win. Grant really did. He had a serious problem."
01:00:51 - 01:01:13 (22 sec),"Serious drinking problem. But, man, was he a good general. And he's finally being recognized as a great general. But Lincoln had almost developed a phobia, because he was having a hard time with a true great fighter and a great general, Robert E. Lee. But Grant figured it out, and Grant is a great general, and Grant came from right here."
01:01:13 - 01:01:46 (33 sec),"Ulysses S. Grant. Ohio is the state that gave us the Wright Brothers. It gave us Neil Armstrong. He's the man that planted the flag -- think of that -- on the face of the moon. Who's that? Who are they -- a relative of -- oh, that's nice. They weren't worried about not planting a flag, right? You know them."
01:01:46 - 01:02:38 (51 sec),"He planted that flag, that American flag right on the face of the moon. There was no kneeling. There was no nothing. There was no games. There was no games. Boom. Wrong, right? Right, fellas? My military guys up here. Of course, my -- excuse me. Excuse me. My military folks all over this arena. And how do you like the fact that the V.A. now has choice, right?"
01:02:38 - 01:03:02 (24 sec),"I said it. But, you know, I skip over it. For 44 years, they've been trying to get choice, and we got it done. That means instead of waiting for 10 days or 5 days or 22 days or 33 days, or 2 months, our great veterans, some of them would be fine, just not feeling so good by the time they saw the doctor. It took so long, they would have a terminal illness."
01:03:02 - 01:03:31 (29 sec),"That's how bad it was. And I got done what they'd been trying to do for 44 years, I think. Forty-four years. Now when they have to wait, they go out, they get the services of a good private doctor, we pay the bill, and they're all better, and that's nice. Forty-four years. It took 44 years to get that done."
01:03:31 - 01:03:56 (25 sec),"I'm just saying that because I see these great military guys. That's pretty much appreciated, fellas, right? That's a big difference. It's a big difference. Made a lot of people very happy. Probably cost us less money. I don't care about that in this case. I care about taking care of our veterans. It's about time."
01:03:56 - 01:04:41 (45 sec),"Generations of Ohio workers farm the fields, poured the incredible steel, fought the battles that made America into the most powerful and prosperous nation in the history of the world. We lost our way. But now we've gained our way back again, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. These courageous Ohio patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage."
01:04:41 - 01:05:14 (33 sec),"We didn't do that. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. That's all we're going to do is win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down."
01:05:14 - 01:05:43 (28 sec),"We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
01:05:43 - 01:06:13 (30 sec),"And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:23 (24 sec),Please. Thank you very much. You can sit. [Laughter] It's great to be with you. And I want to thank Chief Dekmar for that wonderful introduction and for your lifetime of distinguished service. A very special friend of mine.
00:00:23 - 00:00:52 (29 sec),"I'm thrilled to be here in the great state of Florida, with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. On behalf of all Americans, I want to express our eternal gratitude for what you do every single day to protect our families, defend our streets, and take down criminals. And what you do is keep America safe, and nobody does it better than you. Thank you very much. Thank you."
00:00:52 - 00:01:12 (20 sec),"And I also want to thank your amazing families. Because you know that, without them, you couldn't do it. And they're here. And they are indeed fantastic people. So thank you to the families. Appreciate it very much."
00:01:12 - 00:01:43 (31 sec),"We are thrilled to be joined today by a true friend of law enforcement, Governor Rick Scott. And I will tell you that Rick has been incredible when it comes to law enforcement. Anytime you need funds from the federal government, he's on the phone. ""Mr. President, we need more funds."" ""What's it for this time, Rick?"" [Laughter] ""It's for law enforcement."" And I say, ""You got them."""
00:01:43 - 00:01:57 (14 sec),"And speaking of that -- oh, you got them. You got them. When law enforcement wants it -- and they always -- they're reasonable. They want it. And what you do is so incredible."
00:01:57 - 00:02:04 (8 sec),"So I just want to say, Rick is a tremendous governor, and he is your biggest fan. So thank you very much."
00:02:04 - 00:02:19 (15 sec),"And also, another one of your big fans, I will tell you that, is Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is with us today. And thank you, Pam. Thank you very much, wherever you may be. She's in this big room someplace. Thank you. Incredible woman."
00:02:19 - 00:02:40 (21 sec),"Thank you as well to our Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for being here. Flew down together. The press wants to know, ""What did you talk about?"" [Laughter] But we had a very good talk, I will say it. That became a very big story, actually, folks. [Laughter] We had a good talk."
00:02:40 - 00:03:18 (37 sec),"As Hurricane Michael nears landfall, we are working with state and local officials in Florida to take all necessary precautions. And we urge all residents to be prepared and to heed local officials. I told Rick Scott that we are ready for you. We have already briefed FEMA, and FEMA is getting prepared. And it looks like a big one. Can you believe it? It looks like another big one. But we've handled them well. We have handled them very well. And that includes the one that just left us in Florida. It never ends."
00:03:18 - 00:03:31 (14 sec),"But we're all prepared, and hopefully it won't be as bad as it's looking. It looked, to me -- looked, a couple of days ago, like it was not going to be much. And now, it's looking like it could be a very big one. So we're prepared. And good luck."
00:03:31 - 00:03:55 (23 sec),"Today, I also want to extend my very special thanks to Orlando Chief John Mina and the entire Orlando Police Department for hosting us in this great city. John. Where is John? Thank you, John. Great job. Great city. Safe city, too, John. Thank you very much. Great job."
00:03:55 - 00:04:26 (32 sec),"I also want to thank the board of IACP, and congratulations to your incoming President, Chief Paul Cell. Where is Chief? Chief. Good, Chief. I have a lot of respect for the Chief; I know the Chief. That means I guess I have to be here next year, Chief. Is that right? [Laughter] Looking like that, right? That's okay. For you guys, anything I can do, I'll do."
00:04:26 - 00:04:54 (28 sec),"Very importantly -- I want to recognize our law enforcement partners from around the world who have traveled here to share their experiences and to strengthen the vital cooperation that we all practice together. We have great, great cooperation all over the world. We deeply value your friendship and your partnership, and thank you very much for being here. Thank you."
00:04:54 - 00:05:11 (16 sec),"This year, we proudly celebrate the 125th anniversary of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. It's a great group."
00:05:11 - 00:05:35 (25 sec),"Today, I stand before you, as the President of the United States, to tell you that my administration will always honor, cherish, and support the men and women in blue. And we are proud to do it."
00:05:35 - 00:05:48 (13 sec),"Working together, we have achieved extraordinary progress in the fight against violent crime. We understand that reducing crime begins with respecting law enforcement."
00:05:48 - 00:06:01 (13 sec),"For too many years, we have watched politicians escalate political attacks on our courageous police officers. And I've never seen it more than over the last few years. It's disgraceful."
00:06:01 - 00:06:29 (28 sec),"Politicians who spread this dangerous anti-police sentiment make life easier for criminals and more dangerous for law-abiding citizens. And they also make it more dangerous for police. And it must stop, and it must stop now."
00:06:29 - 00:07:07 (39 sec),"Before I took office less than two years ago, our nation was experiencing a historic surge in violent crime. In 2015, 2016, an additional 128,000 violent crimes were committed nationwide compared to the two previous years. That's a tremendous number of additional crime. Over the same period, we witnessed the steepest two-year consecutive increase in murders in nearly half a century."
00:07:07 - 00:07:32 (24 sec),"But we are turning that tide around very rapidly, as you all know in this room. We are taking back our streets from drug lords, gangs, and crimes. We are being tough. We're being smart. By the end of this year, murders in major cities are estimated to drop by close to 10 percent from their levels in 2016."
00:07:32 - 00:07:53 (21 sec),And I have directed the Attorney General's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave. We want to straighten it out. We want to straighten it out fast. There's no reason for what's going on there.
00:07:53 - 00:08:21 (29 sec),"I've told them to work with local authorities to try to change the terrible deal the city of Chicago entered into with ACLU, which ties law enforcement's hands; and to strongly consider stop-and-frisk. It works, and it was meant for problems like Chicago. It was meant for it. Stop-and-frisk."
00:08:21 - 00:08:47 (25 sec),"And Rudy Giuliani, when he was mayor of New York City, had a very strong program of stop-and-frisk. And it went from an unacceptably dangerous city to one of the safest cities in the country -- and, I think, the safest big city in the country. So it works. It's got to be properly applied, but stop-and-frisk works."
00:08:47 - 00:09:20 (34 sec),"The crime spree is a terrible blight on that city, and we'll do everything possible to get it done. I know the law enforcement people in Chicago, and I know how good they are. They could solve the problem if they were simply allowed to do their job and do their job properly. And that's what they want to do. So, Chicago, we're going to start working with you, as of today. Thank you."
00:09:20 - 00:09:32 (11 sec),"In the Fiscal Year 2018, my administration brought charges against more federal firearm defendants and more violent criminals than ever before in the history of our country."
00:09:32 - 00:09:43 (11 sec),"And to help former inmates become law-abiding and productive members of society, we are also working on a prison reform bill -- a very, very big and comprehensive one."
00:09:43 - 00:10:02 (18 sec),"And the best thing that could happen, I think we've already done: We have record numbers of jobs right now in the United States. There has never been a time when more people are working in our country than right now."
00:10:02 - 00:10:21 (20 sec),And our unemployment numbers in almost every category are at record lows. They are record lows. African American -- best in history. Asian American -- best in history. Hispanic American -- best in history. We are doing incredibly well as a -- as an economy.
00:10:21 - 00:10:40 (19 sec),"And that's a great thing when you talk about people coming out of prison -- unable to get a job, totally unable to get a job; it's a hopeless situation. Now, they're getting jobs -- to a certain extent and to a large extent because we're doing so well, and employers are forced to take people that they maybe wouldn't have done."
00:10:40 - 00:11:02 (21 sec),"And some of those employers call me and get back to me. And they say, ""Mr. President, it's amazing how good these people are."" And not all of them -- not all of anybody or any category is going to be great. But tremendous response. And these people have been given a second or even, in some cases, a third shot at it. And they're doing really well."
00:11:02 - 00:11:22 (20 sec),"So the economy being so great, and the jobs picture being so strong -- people are getting an opportunity, and they're doing an incredible job. So I just want to thank everybody in law enforcement. I know you agree with me on this. It's a great thing."
00:11:22 - 00:11:36 (14 sec),"And in particular, I have to thank the IACP for working with us on this effort and for endorsing important prison reform legislation all over the country. And we're doing federal legislation, but all over the country. You folks have been fantastic."
00:11:36 - 00:12:01 (25 sec),"Every single day of my administration, we will stand for law, order, and justice. Just two days ago, the Senate confirmed a supremely qualified nominee who will be a faithful defender of the rule of law -- and will defend the United States Constitution -- the newest Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh."
00:12:01 - 00:12:37 (35 sec),"And I will tell you, when I decided on Brett -- and we have tremendous talent in our legal system. But I decided on Brett. I said, ""He's flawless. He's a flawless person."" The best student. The best scholar. The great intellect. Incredible record over many years. And yet, he's a young man."
00:12:37 - 00:13:06 (29 sec),"I said, ""Brett, congratulations. This is going to be a piece of cake getting you confirmed."" [Laughter] ""This is going to be so easy. It should go quickly, nicely. Don't even worry."" He was so thankful. [Laughter] He said, ""Mr. President, it's the greatest honor of my life -- United States Supreme Court. The greatest of my life."""
00:13:06 - 00:13:37 (31 sec),"So I haven't heard him say that again to me, but I think he still believes it. [Laughter] But he's a great person, and it was very, very unfair what happened to him -- false charges, false accusations, horrible statements that were totally untrue that he knew nothing about. Frankly, terms that he probably never heard in his life. He was this. He was that. He'd never even heard of these terms. It was a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evil."
00:13:37 - 00:14:11 (34 sec),"And he toughed it out. We all toughed it out together. And I have to thank the Republican senators that fought so hard for this because it wasn't easy. And it was a great honor to be involved in this situation. A lot of people would have said, ""Oh, let's give it up. Let's go a different direction."" We don't give up. You don't give up. We don't give up. Just don't do it. He's going to be a great Supreme Court justice -- watch. A great one. He will be a great one."
00:14:11 - 00:14:30 (19 sec),"We will perform the swearing-in tonight at 7 p.m., at the White House. That's very exciting. So I leave here, and I go home, and I swear in a man who will be a truly great United States Supreme Court Justice. That's going to be my honor. Thank you."
00:14:30 - 00:14:58 (28 sec),"And I'm going to tell him about the spontaneous applause. Before I even finished -- you people. [Laughter] Because you knew what I was about to say, but I didn't even say it. And you started before I completed. So that's the kind of -- all over the country, I'm doing rallies, and people are loving that man and loving that choice. So I think we're all going to be very happy."
00:14:58 - 00:15:24 (26 sec),"In order to keep every American safe, we are also making officer safety a top priority. In 2016, an officer was assaulted in America on an average of every 9 minutes. Is this even believable?"
00:15:24 - 00:16:00 (36 sec),"Last week, seven officers were shot in Florence, South Carolina -- incredible state. One was killed; numerous were really badly injured. Our hearts break for the family of fallen Officer Terrence Carraway. We pray for his loved ones and for the officers who are still recovering. When a police officer is assaulted or killed, it is a wound inflicted upon our entire nation. It is."
00:16:00 - 00:16:43 (43 sec),"And I have to say this, I don't think you understand one thing: how much our country loves you and the job you do. You don't hear it from them. You don't hear it from them. They don't tell you the real feeling. They don't tell you the true feeling, but I know the true feeling. I know the true feeling. You don't hear it from the media, but I can tell you, I know the feeling. And these people -- the people of our country love you. So I just want you to know it direct."
00:16:43 - 00:16:44 (1 sec),"We love you, Trump!"
00:16:44 - 00:16:56 (12 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I love him, too. He's just not my type, I'm sorry. [Laughter] He's not my type. Thank you."
00:16:56 - 00:17:09 (14 sec),One of my very first actions as President was to direct my administration to take all necessary action to protect law enforcement from acts of violence against all of you.
00:17:09 - 00:17:25 (16 sec),"We believe that criminals who kill our police officers should immediately, with trial -- but rapidly as possible; not 15 years later, 20 years later -- get the death penalty."
00:17:25 - 00:18:22 (57 sec),"And importantly, we are also making sure you have the equipment you need to do the job. That's why we are allowing local police to access surplus military equipment. And we've been doing this since the very first day of my administration, whereas others didn't want you to have that equipment for very strange reasons. [Laughter] They said it looked too tough, it looked too strong; it's not a good look. You have people shooting at you, and they're worried about your look. [Laughter] Someday you'll explain that one to me, please. I don't quite get it. Explain it."
00:18:22 - 00:18:43 (21 sec),"This equipment doesn't only protect your lives and safety, it protects the lives and safety of every citizen that you serve. During Hurricane Harvey, surplus military equipment helped rescue more than 9,000 people."
00:18:43 - 00:18:59 (17 sec),"We are also taking unprecedented action to help our local police fight the worst drug epidemic in our history -- the opioid crisis -- which took nearly 50,000 American lives last year."
00:18:59 - 00:19:15 (16 sec),"We have secured the most funding in history to give you the tools and resources that you need to hunt down the traffickers, stop these poisonous drugs from coming into our country, and to save American lives."
00:19:15 - 00:19:42 (27 sec),"In fact, today I'm announcing another $42.4 million for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program to attack this epidemic. This grant funding will go to more than 50 innovative projects targeting the greatest drug threats facing the United States."
00:19:42 - 00:20:00 (18 sec),"And I will tell you that, last year in the budget -- this year also -- last year, we got $6 billion -- $6 billion -- to work on the opioid problem at every level, including people -- really helping people that are in need of help."
00:20:00 - 00:20:17 (17 sec),"Last year, we increased the average federal sentence for drug trafficking to its highest level since 2013. For the first time in years, we are ensuring there are real, tough consequences for those who flood our streets with deadly poison."
00:20:17 - 00:20:42 (25 sec),"Thanks to your partnership, last year, our brave ICE agents seized 1 million pounds of narcotics, including almost 7,000 pounds of heroin and more than 2,300 pounds of fentanyl -- saving thousands upon thousands of American lives. And this year, we're way ahead of those numbers."
00:20:42 - 00:21:09 (27 sec),"Last year alone, ICE removed nearly 130,000 criminal aliens from our country. And, as you know, my competitors don't like that. They don't like that. That's the other thing you're going to have to explain to me someday. Including thousands of vicious gang members and MS-13 predators. They're gone. They're gone."
00:21:09 - 00:21:50 (41 sec),"Yet, these brave ICE officers have been subjected to shameless attacks by leading members of the Democrat Party, including outrageous calls to abolish ICE. And also, they're not a big help to us in law enforcement. They don't want to give us the kind of funds that you people are requesting. But you're getting them anyway because we're giving them to you. But they fight us at every turn. The Democrats fight us at every single turn. Whether it's law enforcement or military, they fight us at every turn. But we win."
00:21:50 - 00:22:04 (14 sec),"We condemn the vilification of law enforcement and law enforcement officers, and we stand proudly with the heroes of ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement in general."
00:22:04 - 00:22:29 (25 sec),"We also strongly oppose efforts from politicians to shackle local police departments and prevent them from cooperating with their federal partners. So let's see whether or not Chicago -- as an example, locally -- accepts help. They need it. And we'll straighten it out fast. We're going to straighten it out fast."
00:22:29 - 00:22:37 (8 sec),"I assume they want to straighten it out. Sometimes I think, ""Maybe is it possible that they don't?"" But we're going to be there. We're going to try and help them."
00:22:37 - 00:22:54 (17 sec),"Every day, these sanctuary city policies force the release of criminal aliens and gang members right back onto our streets, putting innocent civilians at grave risk -- many people being killed."
00:22:54 - 00:23:22 (28 sec),"I will fight every day for your right to cooperate with federal law enforcement and to protect your communities as you wish. And I know most of you in this room -- I think probably everybody in this room -- works brilliantly with our federal authorities. And it's our honor to do it -- including funding, by the way -- including funding. Thank you."
00:23:22 - 00:23:56 (34 sec),"Last week, my administration also provided historic levels of funding to improve school safety. Through STOP School Violence grants, we are giving local schools and police departments the resources they need to hire more officers, and train more teachers, and better detect and address early warning signs of mental illness before it's too late. I made a lot of strides in the last year. Heavy funding -- but you've made a lot of strides."
00:23:56 - 00:24:11 (15 sec),"In every action we take, we are defending American safety and treasuring the extraordinary -- I mean, we're just helping as much as we can the extraordinary men and women who protect our communities."
00:24:11 - 00:24:22 (11 sec),Here with us today are all four nominees for the IACP Police Officer of the Year Award.
00:24:22 - 00:25:06 (44 sec),"Officer Taylor Rust serves with the Plano, Texas Police Department. Good place. Where's Taylor? Taylor. Where's Taylor? Come on up here, Taylor. Run up here. They'll let you up. Come on up. We'll get all of them up. Come on."
00:25:06 - 00:25:17 (11 sec),"A year ago, Taylor raced to the scene of an active shooter in a neighborhood, entered the house without any backup at all, and shot and killed the murderer -- it turned out to be somebody with a lot of bad past -- saving the lives of four civilians."
00:25:17 - 00:25:40 (23 sec),"Officer Rust, we salute you and your remarkable courage. You are a great gentleman. Stay up here with me, okay? Say -- come on, say couple of words."
00:25:40 - 00:25:48 (8 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. You'll have to forgive me, I'm much more comfortable in the situation Mr. President described than being up here. [Laughter]"
00:25:48 - 00:25:59 (11 sec),"It's a tremendous honor for me to be here. I appreciate everything IACP has done for us, my family. My wife, Amber, is here. She's been a tremendous support, as well, through this whole thing."
00:25:59 - 00:26:14 (15 sec),"It's been a very humbling experience for me, and it's been an honor to be spoken in the same breath with the other three officers that are sitting over there today. Thank you very much."
00:26:14 - 00:26:29 (15 sec),"That was a good job. He'll be running for office soon. You watch. [Laughter] Thank you very much, Taylor."
00:26:29 - 00:26:51 (22 sec),"Last May, Officer Mark Dallas was on duty at Dixon High School, in Illinois, when he heard gunshots. Within -- listen to this -- three seconds, he was at the scene, right outside the auditorium where the entire senior class was gathered and was in a lot of trouble."
00:26:51 - 00:27:22 (31 sec),"The shooter fled and fired shots at him, but Officer Dallas chased him down before a single student was injured. Officer Dallas's son Joshua was one of the seniors inside that auditorium. Afterwards, Joshua said, ""I wasn't scared for my life at all because I knew my dad would protect us."" How good is that?"
00:27:22 - 00:27:32 (10 sec),"Thank you, Officer Dallas. Where are you? Officer Dallas, come on up here. That's pretty good. That's pretty good."
00:27:32 - 00:27:44 (13 sec),So his son had a little confidence in him. That's not bad. That's beautiful. Beautiful.
00:27:44 - 00:27:58 (14 sec),"Public speaking is not my best, but I'm -- I'm extremely nervous. [Laughter] Mr. President, I appreciate everything, and the support you give us. And I'm honored to be here with the IACP and the other nominees."
00:27:58 - 00:28:05 (7 sec),"My son said he wasn't scared because dad was out there. I was ""dad"" to 182 other kids in that gymnasium."
00:28:05 - 00:28:18 (13 sec),I just want to say thank you. I'm honored and blessed to be here. Thank you.
00:28:18 - 00:28:28 (10 sec),Beautiful story. Thank you very much. That's a beautiful story. And your son was right.
00:28:28 - 00:29:01 (33 sec),"In October of last year, Washington State Trooper Nathaniel Dawson pursued a car that violated a traffic law. When the car stopped, two gunmen began shooting at Trooper Dawson, and shooting very violently. Despite heavy fire, Trooper Dawson got out of his vehicle and fired back until the shooters ran away and were later apprehended. They were very dangerous criminals."
00:29:01 - 00:29:12 (10 sec),"Our streets are safer, and our criminals recoil in fear because of brave officers like Trooper Dawson. And I want to thank you. Come up, please, Trooper Dawson."
00:29:12 - 00:29:38 (26 sec),Wow. It's a great honor to be here tonight. Thank you all for coming -- Mr. President. I think we all would say the same: We're just doing our job. And to be recognized is just extra. So thank you again.
00:29:38 - 00:30:00 (22 sec),"Thank you very much. Thank you. These people have a lot of respect for you. They don't sit down when you're up here. [Laughter] They have a lot of respect, right? That's great. Beautiful."
00:30:00 - 00:30:29 (29 sec),"Finally, Sergeant Luis Celis of the Doral -- I know it well -- Florida Police Department -- they are fantastic -- responded to the call that you all read about -- a big story at the time -- that a shooter was in the lobby of Trump National Doral. Can you believe this is happening to me? And I didn't say, ""Put this manâ¦"" I knew what he did. But they put him. Threatening a lot of people that were in the hotel, including the employees."
00:30:29 - 00:30:50 (21 sec),"Sergeant Celis entered the building, engaged in a vicious shooting attack, and captured the criminal before anyone was hurt -- which was incredible, actually."
00:30:50 - 00:31:12 (22 sec),"Sergeant Celis, that was really a job well done. People are still talking about it. It was an amazing job. Please come up."
00:31:12 - 00:31:23 (12 sec),I guess he's a tough act to follow -- [Laughter] -- what the guy said over here.
00:31:23 - 00:31:40 (16 sec),"Thanks everybody for being here. My wife, Olga. And congratulations to everybody else. Thank you."
00:31:40 - 00:31:51 (11 sec),"And just to conclude, I have to say, in each of these stories we see the unmatched strength, and character, and courage of our amazing heroes in blue."
00:31:51 - 00:32:15 (24 sec),"Every day, our police officers race into darkened allies and deserted streets, and onto the doorsteps of the most hardened criminals -- people you don't want to be dealing with. And you deal with them well. Incredible. They see the worst of humanity, and they respond with the best of the American spirit."
00:32:15 - 00:32:38 (23 sec),"America's police officers have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. In moments of danger and despair, you are the reason we never lose hope -- because there are men and women in uniform who face down evil and stand for all that's good and just and decent and right."
00:32:38 - 00:32:56 (18 sec),"No matter what threat you face, you never give in. You never back down. You are people of tremendous courage and strength. We appreciate it. Appreciate it."
00:32:56 - 00:33:11 (15 sec),Nothing can break your spirit or bend your will -- I've seen it over many years -- because you are the proud men and women of law enforcement.
00:33:11 - 00:33:23 (11 sec),"We thank you. We salute you. We honor you. And we promise you: We will always have your back. Now and forever, we will have your back."
00:33:23 - 00:33:51 (28 sec),"So it's my great honor to be with you today, and I thank you and I thank everyone in this incredible room of heroes -- the International Association of Chiefs of Police. You have very, very special, very smart, very brave, brave people."
00:33:51 - 00:34:06 (15 sec),And on behalf of our incredible country -- our country that's getting stronger and bigger and richer and just better -- we're making it greater. [Laughter] And that's okay. It's greater. We're making it greater.
00:34:06 - 00:34:21 (15 sec),"I want to say God bless you, God bless your families, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:15 (16 sec),"Thank you, folks. I've paid you so much money over the years. David, I've given them so much money. That's all right. And you did a good job. Please."
00:00:15 - 00:00:25 (10 sec),"As a memento for us of him being here, we have created him a hardhat with the Presidential Seal, the American flag, NECA, and our convention logo. You could use this in Washington from time to time. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:00:25 - 00:01:04 (39 sec),"I will use it. I will. That's beautiful. Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you. I don't want to put it on because I'm afraid that I'll mess up my hair. That would be terrible. [Laughter] Did I have a good hair day? Or -- I don't know. Yes? Come on. [Laughter] Got to do it. Thank you, man. Is it still okay? I think so."
00:01:04 - 00:01:19 (15 sec),"Thank you, everybody. Please sit down. And it is true -- I told David, ""David, I paid these guys so much money over the years, built so many beautiful buildings."" And you know what? The job you do is incredible."
00:01:19 - 00:01:38 (19 sec),"I'd go to some of those switchboards and I'd go to some of those connectors, and I said, ""These are smart people. Putting that together, these are smart..."" -- and you are, you're smart people and you're talented people. Few people could do what you do, that I can tell you. So, thank you. Thank you. That's true."
00:01:38 - 00:01:58 (21 sec),"And thank you, David. I'm thrilled to be in the great city of Philadelphia. I went to college here at the Wharton School of Finance -- U of Penn -- with thousands of our nation's most skilled and talented workers -- the electrical contractors who make our country run. So true."
00:01:58 - 00:02:19 (21 sec),"I also know from firsthand experience, America's electrical contractors are the best in the world. Nobody even close. And now -- that's true. Nobody close. And now, you have a friend and an ally in the White House. And you do. You have a friend."
00:02:19 - 00:02:56 (37 sec),"I want to thank John Grau, Dan Walter, Mark Mazur -- well, that's a very interesting name, Greg Rick. Where -- who's Greg Rick? Where's Greg? [Laughter] Stand up. I love that name. ""Greg Rick."" They have a lot of problem back-and-forth, I'll bet, huh? Over your life, huh? [Laughter] They call you ""Rick""; they call you ""Greg."" [Laughter] And he's a good man. And the incredible leadership team at the National Electrical Contractors Association. You have great leadership."
00:02:56 - 00:03:06 (10 sec),"With your help, we will protect this noble trade for many generations to come. And you're protecting it yourself with your talent."
00:03:06 - 00:03:28 (22 sec),I also want to thank a very special group of people who always get the job done and get it done right -- the proud members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Thank you very much. Thank you.
00:03:28 - 00:03:38 (9 sec),"And speaking of energy, we are honored to be joined by Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- where's Rick? He's around here. Stand up, Rick. Great job he's doing. Doing a great job."
00:03:38 - 00:04:02 (25 sec),"And Alex Acosta, as you know, Secretary of Labor. Alex. Thank you, Alex. He just developed two incredible healthcare plans that really work and they're really popular. Thank you very much, Alex."
00:04:02 - 00:04:24 (21 sec),"As well as two tremendous leaders from Pennsylvania, Congressmen G.T. Thompson and the great Lou Barletta -- going to be your next senator I hope. Thank you. Thank you, G.T. Thank you, G.T. And thank you, Lou. What a job you're doing."
00:04:24 - 00:04:37 (13 sec),"I'll tell you what, if he's your next senator, you're going to have no more problems. He is a doer. So, I'm very proud of you, man. Great job. And I hear you're doing well, and I'm proud."
00:04:37 - 00:04:46 (9 sec),"Also here with us are members of the Mississippi congressional delegation. In fact, I'm going there with the delegation. I'll be there tonight."
00:04:46 - 00:04:59 (13 sec),"People say, ""Where do you get this energy?"" You know where I get it? I love doing it, actually. If you love doing it, it's easy. Right, David? If you don't like doing it, not so good."
00:04:59 - 00:05:30 (31 sec),"Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith -- where's Cindy? Cindy. Thank you, Cindy. I hear you're doing really well. A man who always does well, Senator Roger Wicker. Roger. Been a great friend of mine from the beginning. Thank you, Roger. And Representative Gregg Harper. Thanks, Gregg. Thank you, Gregg."
00:05:30 - 00:05:44 (14 sec),"This is really an incredible time for our nation. We are respected again. We are respected again, like we haven't been respected in many, many decades."
00:05:44 - 00:06:17 (33 sec),"We have the best economy in our history. Stock market today just hit another record high. That's the hundred -- I think its 103 times since I'm President that we've hit a new high. And hopefully, next year at this time we'll hit many more. But that's not a bad number, right? I think we're up to 103. And if I'm off just by a little bit -â like if it's 102 -- it'll be headlines. ""Trump exaggerated."" [Laughter] That's why I always say ""I think it's around..."""
00:06:17 - 00:06:29 (12 sec),"With a Republican Congress, we've added more than 4 million new jobs since Election Day, and lifted 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Those are tremendous numbers."
00:06:29 - 00:07:00 (32 sec),"Jobless claims are at a 50-year low. And the stock market, as I just said, is at an all-time high today. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have all recently achieved their lowest levels ever recorded. That's pretty good."
00:07:00 - 00:07:24 (23 sec),"That's a very hard soundbite to beat, right, if you're the opponent of Trump? When you say ""highest and best numbers we've ever had."" And we have created over 50,000 new jobs in electrical contracting. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Nobody thought that was going to be happening. And it's going way up. It's going up very fast."
00:07:24 - 00:07:44 (21 sec),America's â- and just remember this â- America's economic revival would not be possible without the men and women in this room. Would not be possible. I've built so much. I've done so much business with you. I've watched the things you've done and it's incredible.
00:07:44 - 00:08:06 (21 sec),"We are truly grateful to our electricians, our wiremen, linemen, engineers, technicians, journeymen, contractors, and apprentices â- oh, I love that word. That was a great -- I love the word ""apprentice."" I love that word."
00:08:06 - 00:08:16 (10 sec),"You know, I did that show 14 seasons, and then I left. They wanted to sign me for three more seasons. I said, ""No, I'm going to run for President."" [Laughter] It's true."
00:08:16 - 00:08:28 (12 sec),"So they replaced me with a big, big movie star. And it didn't last too well. It was gone like â- quickly. But I love that name. ""The Apprentice."""
00:08:28 - 00:08:53 (24 sec),"Who keep the engine of American prosperity running full speed ahead. We're also fixing decades of disastrous trade deals that have plundered our factories and stolen our wealth and our jobs. What's happened here over the last 20, 25 years, and more is horrible."
00:08:53 - 00:09:11 (18 sec),"But we're changing it all. We've added 400,000 new manufacturing jobs since the election. And that number, very shortly, will be up, David, to 640,000. Big things are happening currently."
00:09:11 - 00:09:25 (14 sec),"And if you remember, the past administration said those are jobs that you're not going to be adding. ""You're going to need a magic wand."" Do you remember that? Magic wand. There was no magic wand; it's good policy and other things."
00:09:25 - 00:09:37 (13 sec),We are in the midst of a manufacturing renaissance â- something which nobody thought you'd hear â- which means more jobs for our great electrical contractors.
00:09:37 - 00:10:05 (27 sec),"Yesterday, we made history by announcing an incredible, brand new trade deal to replace the horrible NAFTA deal that drained our country of jobs and companies. As I have said many times -- NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made in any country at any time."
00:10:05 - 00:10:19 (14 sec),And now we have a great trade deal. And we have deal that is also good for Mexico and good for Canada. And we have a good partnership with the three. And it worked out. It all worked out.
00:10:19 - 00:10:33 (15 sec),"As you probably noticed, and read, and saw, there were a little tough negotiations. But you know what? It all worked out. And we're now on the right track. And we did a great deal with South Korea. It's all working out."
00:10:33 - 00:10:52 (19 sec),"Now, as you probably have heard, we're looking at China and other countries, and we're straightening out some of these horrible deals that stole our wealth, stole our jobs, stole so much from us. Actually, in many ways, stole our dignity as a country."
00:10:52 - 00:11:33 (40 sec),"Our landmark new trade agreement is called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Like YMCA; or United States Marine Corps, with an ""A"" at the end. [Laughter] I liked the way it sounded. I didn't want to use the name ""NAFTA,"" because NAFTA has been so bad for us. I would watch 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago -- you look at New England where the factories were devastated. People forget. People forget. You still have empty buildings all over the country from NAFTA, so I didn't want to use the name ""NAFTA."""
00:11:33 - 00:11:54 (21 sec),"â USMCA is the most advanced, modern, and balanced trade agreement ever negotiated. It is also the largest trade deal the United States has ever made. And we think it's the largest trade deal ever made in the world -- $1.2 trillion in commerce a year."
00:11:54 - 00:12:30 (36 sec),"The USMCA will protect American workers, substantially increase exports of American agriculture. Our farmers are so happy. I spoke with Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa this morning. She was so happy. And the farmers and agricultural people are thrilled. They didn't know if we'd ever be able to make a deal or certainly a fair deal for them. They're thrilled. And this deal will revitalize, also, the American auto industry."
00:12:30 - 00:13:02 (32 sec),"One thing I wanted was, I don't want any incentives to get companies to leave our country; fire everybody; move to Mexico, or Canada, or someplace, and build cars and send them in -- no tax, no nothing; and, in the meantime, we end up with nothing except unemployed people. Not going to happen anymore. That's what I wanted in this deal. It was so important. It was so important."
00:13:02 - 00:13:16 (14 sec),"Do you remember those days? You all remember those days? When everybody was leaving the country? Going to make a product, send it in, and we end up with unemployed. That's about all we got out of it -- no nothing. So those days are over, folks."
00:13:16 - 00:13:39 (23 sec),"Last week, I also stood beside President Moon and announced a new trade deal with South Korea that will increase exports of American-made cars very, very substantially; increase exports of agriculture; and also medicine, which is very big and very important business."
00:13:39 - 00:13:53 (14 sec),"We're preparing to start negotiations, right now, with Japan. And we have taken the toughest-ever actions in our history against China's very abusive trading policies and trade practices."
00:13:53 - 00:14:17 (24 sec),"China has been taking out of our country $500 billion a year and it was time to stop. Nobody ever did it. It's crazy. Nobody ever did it -- $500 billion a year. And we're going to have a great relationship with China, but we have to be fair to ourselves, also."
00:14:17 - 00:14:38 (21 sec),"After years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, and we are doing it with -- American aluminum, American steel, and with our great electrical contractors. It's true. But we're rebuilding our country. Yep."
00:14:38 - 00:14:56 (18 sec),We're committed to revitalizing our infrastructure and strengthening our electrical grid. It's so important.
00:14:56 - 00:15:30 (34 sec),"Last week, I proudly signed legislation to completely rebuild the United States military. We're purchasing the finest equipment on Earth, and it will be all made right here in the USA. We make the best equipment in the world. We make the greatest military equipment in the world -- greatest missiles, greatest rockets, greatest planes, best rifles, best ships. We make the best military equipment, by far, in the world."
00:15:30 - 00:15:50 (20 sec),"And it's made also -- much less importantly, in this case, David -- but it's also made with American jobs, which is very good. Normally jobs is number one. When it comes to military, we'll put jobs at number two. We need the equipment, right? Probably seldom so much as these times."
00:15:50 - 00:16:14 (24 sec),"And interestingly -- I hope we never have to use it -- but you know what assures that, or at least almost assures that? Having the most powerful military, by far, that we've ever had means we'l probably never have to use it. It's very simple. We learned that -- we learned that a long time ago, right? We learned that a long time ago."
00:16:14 - 00:16:48 (34 sec),"Another critical element of national security is energy security. And, Rick Perry, you're doing a great job. I'm proud of you. Very proud of you. He was the governor of Texas for 12 years. He was not only a great governor; he was a great cheerleader. And he ran for President -- he was nasty against me, wasn't he, though? Wow. [Laughter] He was tough. And you're doing great, Rick. We appreciate it very much."
00:16:48 - 00:17:12 (24 sec),We are now the single largest producer of oil and gas anywhere in the world. This was very recent. Took a lot of regulations off. We have plenty left. But we took regulations off which allowed us to do things that we would never have been able to do. Think of it: We're the single-largest producer of energy in the world. Did you ever think you were going to hear that? This all happened very quickly.
00:17:12 - 00:17:32 (20 sec),"We've ended the war on clean, beautiful, Pennsylvenle [Pennsylvania] -- hey -- your clean, beautiful, Pennsylvania coal. Right? It's beautiful. It's clean. What they can do with coal today is incredible. And we have more of it than anybody in the world and we're producing energy-rich Pennsylvania shale."
00:17:32 - 00:18:00 (28 sec),"To get you more contracts and more jobs, we've slashed a record number of regulations. And we've approved immediately -- like first day, first week -- the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipelines. That's 48,000 jobs in one day. Boom, boom. Had to sign something."
00:18:00 - 00:18:21 (21 sec),"Those companies have never had it so good. That was dead. Both of them were dead. And I came along. I think it could've been my first day, Rick. Right? But close. And we signed it -- 48,000 jobs immediately. And better than riding it on top, on the railroads. Better environmentally. You know, they talk about the environment."
00:18:21 - 00:18:38 (17 sec),"And right now, our air is record clean. And our water is crystal clear. And that's what we want. But we don't want stopping jobs. We don't want to do what some people wanted us to do -- mostly, our foreign competitors."
00:18:38 - 00:18:58 (20 sec),"And I've ordered federal agencies to dramatically speed up the federal permitting process so that you can get approvals much more quickly. We have the time down to one half of one half already. It used to take 20 years to get a highway approved; we're close to two years, and I'd like to get it down to one."
00:18:58 - 00:19:16 (18 sec),"And that doesn't mean they're going to approve it. But if they're not going to approve it, somebody doesn't have to give up their entire life going through an approval process only to have a 3 to 2 vote -- ""we're not going to approve it."" So, we're going to be close to one year, from twenty."
00:19:16 - 00:19:48 (32 sec),"My administration has also taken historic action to make healthcare more affordable. Through Association Health Plans -- that's Alex -- we are allowing businesses to band together and to buy much more affordable insurance for their employees, including across state lines -- meaning you have tremendous competition. You have to see these insurance companies. They're going crazy -- sort of like the fake news media. They're going crazy. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:19:48 - 00:19:56 (8 sec),"I used the term last night ""loco"" -- in order to get the business -- meaning you're getting good deals. They're getting great deals."
00:19:56 - 00:20:10 (13 sec),"We opened up short-term, limited-duration plans so that individuals can buy the plan they want and the plan that they need at tremendously reduced costs. We've done great with that."
00:20:10 - 00:20:39 (29 sec),"And we've eliminated much of Obamacare. And most importantly, we've eliminated the individual mandate. It's gone. That was the thing in Obamacare that was just no good, where you paid a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay a fortune to have bad health care. Right? You know, guys are paying thousands of dollars so they don't have to buy healthcare. We've gotten rid of it. Gone. That was a big one."
00:20:39 - 00:21:01 (22 sec),"Thanks to our actions, I am pleased to announce that, for the first time since Obamacare was passed, premiums are not going to go up next year. We have done everything in the book. They are actually going to go down somewhat. And if we weren't here, if you had another administration -- they were going up another 122 percent, 153 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent."
00:21:01 - 00:21:17 (15 sec),"And you look at what we've done, just through management of healthcare, and it's not good stuff but we've keep the premiums down to the lowest number that they've been. So we're very happy with that. A lot of people are very happy with that. Thank you."
00:21:17 - 00:21:55 (39 sec),"And we're strongly protecting your Medicare. We oppose efforts from Democrats to raid Medicare to fund socialism, robbing seniors of their benefits. Medicare belongs to the seniors who have earned it and paid into it for their entire lives. They want to take it away -- the Democrats. And we will always protect Americans with preexisting conditions. That's a major part of what I'm all about."
00:21:55 - 00:22:33 (38 sec),"At the heart of our economic revival are the massive tax cuts passed by Republicans in Congress. We didn't get one Democrat vote. And those tax cuts are one of the reasons the economy is doing so well. But you're talking about a lot of money in the pockets of everybody in this room. A typical family of four earning $75,000, as an example, will see an income tax cut of more than $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half, and, in many cases, much more than that. Big difference."
00:22:33 - 00:22:44 (11 sec),And small businesses can now deduct 20 percent of their business income -- one of the most significant small business tax cuts in the history of our country. Very big cut. Big incentive.
00:22:44 - 00:23:07 (22 sec),"Capital investments are soaring because you can now immediately deduct every penny spent on new equipment. You can do one-year expensing. Nobody thought that was ever going to happen. In fact, I should leave and go back into business maybe. If you would have told me that when I was a private businessman, maybe I wouldn't have run for President."
00:23:07 - 00:23:35 (28 sec),"One-year -- think of it -- one-year expensing. Normally, you write it off over 30, 40 years. One-year expensing. That's an incentive to go out and do what you have to do. And I always said that was going to be one of the most important things in the package. That was a small clause that a lot of people didn't talk about. And I said, ""That's going to be one of the most important."""
00:23:35 - 00:24:12 (37 sec),"And bringing back trillions of dollars from overseas -- money that was going to be spent in other parts of the world. Apple is bringing back $230 billion. They're building plants all over the United States, and a great -- from what I hear, a great campus, they call it. So many things are happening. But billions and billions of dollars is being brought back into our country -- money that could never have been brought back under the old system."
00:24:12 - 00:24:21 (10 sec),"And from now on, small business owners will be spared from the deeply unfair estate tax, also known as the ""death tax."""
00:24:21 - 00:24:40 (19 sec),"So if you have a small business or a farm or something -- and you love your kids -- now, if you don't love your kids, it doesn't help you. [Laughter] Because if your kids don't treat you good, don't leave it to them. Give it to somebody else. [Laughter] So it doesn't help."
00:24:40 - 00:25:11 (31 sec),"But if you love your kids, which probably 82 percent of you do -- according to most [Inaudible] -- [Laughter] -- you can now leave your small business or your beautiful little farm or whatever it is that you're so proud of -- you leave it to your kids, and they don't have to go out to the bank and borrow to pay the tax and end up losing it in a foreclosure. It's such a big thing. A lot of people don't talk about it, but we were able to get it."
00:25:11 - 00:25:22 (11 sec),"So the estate tax -- and the death tax, which is sort of the same thing -- but gone -- essentially gone for small business. So that's great. A very big thing."
00:25:22 - 00:26:04 (42 sec),"One of the millions of small businesses that is thriving thanks to tax cuts is Wilson Construction Company in Canby, Oregon. Stacy Wilson runs the business with her family, and she joins us today. Stacy, please come up and tell us about the incredible growth that you've seen since the institution of our tax cuts. Where is Stacy? Go ahead, Stacy. Come on up. From Oregon."
00:26:04 - 00:26:07 (3 sec),"Thank you, Stacy."
00:26:07 - 00:26:09 (2 sec),Thank you. Wow.
00:26:09 - 00:26:09 (0 sec),[Inaudible]
00:26:09 - 00:26:11 (2 sec),Thank you very much. Wow.
00:26:11 - 00:26:14 (3 sec),I'll put that down.
00:26:14 - 00:26:22 (8 sec),"Thank you. Wow. Truly an honor. Thank you so much, Mr. President."
00:26:22 - 00:26:23 (1 sec),It's my honor.
00:26:23 - 00:26:57 (34 sec),"As Mr. President said, my name is Stacy Wilson. We own an electrical contracting company out of Canby, Oregon. We are a midsize company that is family-owned. My grandfather started the company 65 years ago in Oregon and Washington. And my father, Don Wilson, has really made it what it is today -- a nationwide company that specializes in transmission, distribution, and substation projects nationwide."
00:26:57 - 00:27:43 (45 sec),"We employ about 500 employees. And thanks to Mr. Trump and the tax reforms and the general confidence in the economy, I guess, we have really been able to invest more in our employees and grow our company in the last year. We're investing more in employee wages and benefits and bonuses. We're spending millions on equipment and assets. And, in general, we're just seeing a huge increase in work that is coming out because utilities are spending more to update this aging infrastructure."
00:27:43 - 00:27:44 (2 sec),So thank you very much.
00:27:44 - 00:27:47 (2 sec),"Well, thank you so much."
00:27:47 - 00:28:25 (38 sec),"It's made a huge impact. And -- so we are looking to grow about 20 to 30 percent more in employees just in the next few months. We have a lot of large projects that are starting. And this will make, I think, a big difference in -- really, these incentives that are good for businesses are really important for our employees but also the communities we work in. And we've really been thankful and have seen this since President Trump has been in office."
00:28:25 - 00:28:38 (13 sec),"So, thank you so much for this opportunity and this great acknowledgement. I never thought I would be up here, so thank you. [Laughs]"
00:28:38 - 00:28:39 (2 sec),"Thank you, Stacy."
00:28:39 - 00:28:58 (19 sec),"I see that, you know, Stacy comes up -- no notes, no nothing, nothing to read -- and gives a speech better than the politicians, folks. [Laughter] The politicians, they walk up with papers; everything is scripted. They read it. They stutter. Look at her, she's, like, great."
00:28:58 - 00:29:31 (33 sec),"Okay, now she's famous too, so she'll probably become a governor of Oregon. She'll become a governor, or a senator. Great job. Very impressive. That's very impressive."
00:29:31 - 00:29:48 (17 sec),"Another success story in this world, in this great land of ours, is Arcadia Electric in Ridgewood, New York. That's right where I grew up -- right near where I grew up. Company president Steve Gianotti is with us. And, Steve, could you come up and tell us about that great success that you're experiencing, especially recently? Thank you, Steve."
00:29:48 - 00:29:49 (1 sec),"Good afternoon, everyone."
00:29:49 - 00:30:01 (12 sec),"First, I'd like to thank President Trump for his perseverance in helping us with his fiscal policy, which have enabled my company, Arcadia Electric, to bid on more work, and take on more jobs that we're able to do now because we have more coming that's available to us, more than ever before."
00:30:01 - 00:30:30 (29 sec),"And as a result of that, we have been able to keep our 120 people employed. But next year, we anticipate hiring 25 percent more hardworking union workers, middle-class workforce that will -- bring our company to approximately 150 employees, which we're very proud of. They work hard. They're the safest, hardest, union workers. And their professional abilities is what makes us successful."
00:30:30 - 00:31:02 (33 sec),"And for that I have to, again, thank the President of the United States for his perseverance and for enabling us to get this work and to change the regulatory policies that he's been doing -- that he spoke of earlier. This is all helpful to us. So, President Trump, thank you very much."
00:31:02 - 00:31:04 (2 sec),"Thanks. Thank you, Steve. Great job."
00:31:04 - 00:31:30 (26 sec),"We want to give every citizen the opportunity to achieve their American Dream. That's why we're committed to expanding apprenticeships, and on-the-job-training, and vocational education -- you know, a word that you don't hear that much. I'm bringing it back. Because when I was growing up -- I had so many vocational schools, and you don't hear that anymore."
00:31:30 - 00:31:58 (28 sec),"You hear ""junior college."" You hear all sorts of names, but the vocational is what I understood and that's what I like. And I had people that went to school with me, and, in some cases, they weren't great students. But they could take apart an engine blindfolded, put it back together 15 different ways. They were so much more talented than the ""A"" student. We would have been ""D"" students. And that's what they want to do, and that's what they love, and it's called ""vocational."" So we're bringing that word back a lot."
00:31:58 - 00:32:22 (24 sec),"But you have tremendously talented people that are, frankly, making a tremendous living -- making a lot of money. And we love those people. They're very special, so we're bringing back the word ""vocational."" And we're bringing it back strong."
00:32:22 - 00:32:41 (19 sec),"My administration is making a historic investment in workforce development. We established the National Council on the American Worker, and I recently signed a bill to provide more than $1 billion annually for vocational education."
00:32:41 - 00:33:08 (27 sec),"Employers all across the country are signing our Pledge to America's Workers, expanding job opportunities for more than 4.2 million Americans. And that number is soon going to reach 10 million Americans, including 60,000 Americans who will have access to apprenticeships and on-the-job training thanks to the National Electrical Contractors Association. Thank you, David. Thank you, David."
00:33:08 - 00:33:48 (40 sec),"And one of the countless Americans who has experienced the tremendous benefits of an apprenticeship is Liam Nickelaides -- a proud Air Force veteran, a National Guardsman, and a member of Philadelphia's own Local 98. Liam, please come up. Tell us your great story, please."
00:33:48 - 00:33:52 (4 sec),Yes. How is everybody doing today? [Laughter]
00:33:52 - 00:34:08 (16 sec),"So, as an apprentice, it's a pretty easy schedule. Mondays, you wake up at 4:20 in the morning. Tuesdays, you wake up at the same time, you give a speech in front of a couple thousand people and the President of the United States. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:34:08 - 00:34:08 (0 sec),That's great.
00:34:08 - 00:34:53 (44 sec),"For me, my apprenticeship experience has been a pretty good one. When I went to get a job with Local 98, as a member of the Air Force National Guard, I told them that there'd be a good chance that I'd be deploying pretty often. And I told them that during my interview. And I really thank God for the opportunity that they still gave me to get a job and to train me in their union."
00:34:53 - 00:35:21 (28 sec),"So, I thought that maybe it would be just words that I'd get from Local 98. That, yeah, they support the military, but I didn't really know if I could believe it. But I was able to deploy for three months -- short little deployment. And upon my return, I was able to get pushed right back into the education program with the Local 98. And I'm back working -- upon arrival, back in the United States. And tomorrow, I'm waking up at 4:20, and going back to work again. [Laughter, Applause]"
00:35:21 - 00:35:22 (1 sec),"So, thank you."
00:35:22 - 00:36:11 (49 sec),"Is he a natural? Huh? [Laughter, Applause] Thank you, Liam. Good luck with everything. Wow. That's so great. That's so great. They don't even seem nervous, you know? [Laughter] They come up here -- no notes, no nothing. I think it's great. Thank you very much."
00:36:11 - 00:36:40 (29 sec),"And I want to thank you to everyone here today for your investment in America's future, and for your devotion to the American worker. So important. Hardworking citizens like you who have always been the backbone of our nation will always be the most important factor in our nation. You make it grow, you make it work."
00:36:40 - 00:37:03 (23 sec),"You power our homes, you light up our skylines, and you make the glory of America shine for all the world to see. You take pride in your work, and America takes pride in all of you in this big, beautiful room."
00:37:03 - 00:37:30 (27 sec),"You pour out your hearts to earn a living, you create loving homes for your family, and you teach your children to cherish our values and to cherish our great American flag. Always."
00:37:30 - 00:37:50 (19 sec),"In a house not far from where we are today, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, and forever changed the course of human history. Today, we reaffirm our nation's founding truth: In America, the people govern."
00:37:50 - 00:38:03 (14 sec),"The men and women who go to work each day are not only powering our economy, they are powering our nation and they are powering our freedom."
00:38:03 - 00:38:33 (29 sec),"America will always be a nation of great builders. Because in America, we honor work. We honor grit. We honor craftsmanship. We honor the men and women who turn dreams into reality with their own two, beautiful hands. In America, we honor all of you."
00:38:33 - 00:39:01 (28 sec),"With cable, copper, wire, and steel, you are the ones lighting America's path forward. So important. So important. You may not even understand how important it is, what you do. You are the ones rebuilding this land that we love. You are the ones who are making America greater than ever before."
00:39:01 - 00:39:11 (10 sec),Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
00:00:00 - 00:00:43 (43 sec),"That's right, USA. And hello, Kentucky. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in the heartland with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots. In just 24 days, the people of Kentucky -- we love Kentucky -- greatest horses in the world and plenty of other things -- are going to elect an incredible slate of Republican candidates to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and continue making America great again."
00:00:43 - 00:01:36 (54 sec),"Just hours ago, we celebrated another tremendous victory for the American people. You know what I'm talking about. We're having a lot of victories, folks. Can you handle it? In the Oval Office of the White House, I welcomed home Pastor Andrew Brunson, great man, from Turkey. He is now free from jail. Think of that, 35-year jail sentence, 35 years."
00:01:36 - 00:02:07 (31 sec),"Not anymore. He's back with his family, together with his wife, and he is on American soil. And it's a beautiful family. They're all together. And I want to thank President Erdogan of Turkey. He was -- he was terrific. We all worked together. It wasn't easy. It wasn't easy. That one wasn't easy. And we don't pay ransom."
00:02:07 - 00:02:45 (38 sec),"We don't pay ransom. But I do -- I want to thank the president. I want to thank the people of Turkey. And I think we'll probably now really establish a terrific relationship with Turkey. We appreciate it. This evening, in the wake of Hurricane Michael, our thoughts are with our fellow citizens in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia."
00:02:45 - 00:03:37 (52 sec),"They got hit hard. They got hit hard, especially when you look at -- when you look at Florida, did you ever see anything like that? And you look at Georgia, Georgia got hit hard. That was some wind force. Up to 200 miles -- almost 200 miles an hour, one of the most vicious we've ever been hit with. So I just want to thank all of those incredible people, the people of FEMA, the first responders... law enforcement, and all of the thousands of federal employees and National Guard, all of the personnel, they're now on the ground, they're supporting this really major recovery."
00:03:37 - 00:04:00 (23 sec),"I will say, you have thousands of electrical trucks all lined up, they're following in, they're getting the roads cleared, not easy. And they have done some job. You had 600,000 people without electric. In one day, they got it down to 250,000. That's some job, one day. And we will not rest until the job is done."
00:04:00 - 00:04:42 (42 sec),"We're here tonight to discuss everything we have accomplished together in less than two years' time. Think of it. Think of it. And I'm here tonight, although I've been back many times, I love this state... to thank the people of Kentucky for 2016. We didn't have to wait too long for that. We didn't have to wait too long for that."
00:04:42 - 00:05:16 (33 sec),"Remember, the vote is in, the polls have closed in Kentucky, Donald Trump is the winner of Kentucky. That was fast. That was fast. And to make sure that America's extraordinary comeback, we want to make sure it continues full speed ahead. We don't want Democrats... that are coming from a different place, we don't want them getting in office."
00:05:16 - 00:06:27 (71 sec),"All they'll do is abstract. Under Republican leadership, America is booming. It's thriving. America is winning again because we are finally putting America first. [Audience chants USA] Our country's unemployment rate has just fallen to 3.7 percent, the lowest in over 50 years. Fifty years. Median household income has reached an all-time high."
00:06:27 - 00:06:57 (30 sec),"That's pretty good. It means you're making more money than you've ever made before. I don't know how much better, but we're going to get it up higher. We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And some of you will love this, and I'm proud of it, these are great people, it's a great resource when properly used."
00:06:57 - 00:07:39 (42 sec),"We have ended the war on clean, beautiful coal. We're putting our miners back to work like never before. They're going back, back, back. And after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. And we are doing it with American iron, aluminum, and look at what happened to steel."
00:07:39 - 00:08:10 (30 sec),"You see the comeback with steel? Everyone's going back to work. The steel mills are opening up, U.S. Steel, Nucor. They're all opening up their steel mills. That was faster than I thought. And we're stopping the dumping. And if they want to dump, they can but they got to pay a lot. So if you think about it, so true, despite our size, America is now the hottest country anywhere in the world."
00:08:10 - 00:08:42 (32 sec),"This is where people want to be. Since my election, we've picked up in worth $11.7 trillion. Think of that. Think of it. And we are going to get along great with China, but we're doing things with China, and they've dropped about $20 trillion. But you know what? They're going to be just fine, but they have to treat us fairly."
00:08:42 - 00:09:42 (61 sec),"They have to treat us fairly. Right? That's right. And every day, we are living by our motto, promises made, promises kept. [Audience Chants Trump] And you look back there at the fake news media, look at them. Look at them. It's like the Academy Awards every time. You know, I'd like to walk into a place one night and not have any of these guys."
00:09:42 - 00:10:09 (27 sec),"Boy. It gets bigger and bigger. But even they have said that President Trump, and you know they probably get fired the next day, that President Trump made promises during the campaign, and I've actually produced more than the promises I made. How often do you hear that? And we all produced it together. We have incredible people."
00:10:09 - 00:10:30 (21 sec),"Mitch and Rand, and we all produced it together. We have a great team. But we need more of them. We need more Republican votes. We have a majority that's essentially, Rand, not a majority. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority, right? So we have to get some more Republicans in there, and we're here for some good ones tonight."
00:10:30 - 00:10:55 (25 sec),"On Monday night at the White House, we kept one of the biggest and most historic promises of all. Do you know what we're talking about, right? Never has a man been treated so badly. America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. A great, great gentleman."
00:10:55 - 00:11:55 (60 sec),"What happened to him was so unfair. I've never seen anything like it. And we stuck with him all the way because we knew the facts. We stuck with him all the way. And Rand Paul and Mitch, they stuck with him. No doubts about it. No doubts. Remember that. Remember that. He now sits alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch to defend your sacred rights and your God-given freedom."
00:11:55 - 00:12:42 (47 sec),"What the crazy, radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh is a national disgrace. From the moment Brett Kavanaugh was known, well, you know what happened. We announced the name, we nominated him, and literally from the moment he was nominated, they didn't even know. It's actually, if you think of it, it's from before he was nominated, nobody knew anything about who it was going to be. I didn't even make my decision yet, and they started saying horrible things about whoever the person might be. They were on a mission to obstruct, resist, delay, demolish, and destroy."
00:12:42 - 00:13:16 (34 sec),"The Democrats have become totally consumed by their chilling lust for power. And I'll tell you something, we have a man, one of the most powerful men in the world, it's OK, comes from Kentucky, that's not bad. Got to respect that. And he heard about this, he says I want to be there. He's one of yours. He's joining us tonight."
00:13:16 - 00:13:51 (35 sec),"He's rock-ribbed Kentucky leader. He's been a leader for a long time. There's nobody tougher. There's nobody smarter. He refused to cave to the radical Democrats' shameful campaign of political and personal destruction. He stared down, tough cookie -- I know tough people, he's tough, he's Kentucky tough, which is about as tough... He stared down the angry left-wing mob."
00:13:51 - 00:13:56 (5 sec),"He never blinked, and he never looked back, and he got us a man who will be one of our great, great Supreme Court justices, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Come up here."
00:13:56 - 00:14:11 (15 sec),"Thank you, Kentucky. Aren't we proud of President Trump? Let me just add, thanks to President Trump and a Republican Senate, 84 new federal judges already this Congress. That's already a record, Mr. President. Keep sending them our way and we'll keep confirming them and change the court system forever. Thank you for being here."
00:14:11 - 00:15:36 (85 sec),"Thank you. And Mitch is a true fighter for Kentucky. He loves this state. And you know, we'll be running together in 2020. That will be a lot of fun. Thank you, Mitch. On this Election Day, November 6th, every American faces a simple choice. You can either vote for Democrat mob rule or you can vote for a Republican Party that stands proudly for law and order, fairness, freedom, and justice."
00:15:36 - 00:16:20 (44 sec),"Simple as that. If Nancy Pelosi... crying Chuck Schumer, and the radical Democrats take over Congress, they will try to raise your taxes, they will immediately restore job-killing regulations, they will impose, believe it or not, socialism, take away your health care, your health care and your whole life will be unaffordable, shut down immediately, oh, forget this one, shut down your coal mines in about two minutes."
00:16:20 - 00:16:49 (29 sec),"You see what's going on with the Second Amendment? They will destroy your Second Amendment. And the Democrats want to open our borders to a flood of deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The fact is, Democrats have become the party of crime. They have. Republicans are the party of safety, and we are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs."
00:16:49 - 00:17:25 (36 sec),"And we're thrilled to be joined this evening by several terrific Kentucky Republicans. First of all, Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? Thank you. Congressman Tom Massie. They've got them spread all over the place. Where's Tom? Doing a great job, thank you. They're doing a great job."
00:17:25 - 00:18:27 (62 sec),"Congressman Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Congressman James Comer, James Comer. Thanks, James. James, the whole group, they have been incredible, I'll tell you what. We got tax cuts, biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. We got so many other things. ANWR. We got rid of the individual mandate. We had Obamacare repealed and replaced."
00:18:27 - 00:19:08 (41 sec),"We didn't get one Democrat vote, but we'll get it done. We had a little disappointment that night. A little bit of a disappointment. But it's essentially done anyway, because when you get rid of the mandate, the individual mandate, it's done. And what we have done with the remnants of Obamacare is we've kept your premiums down far below what anybody would have thought, through good management, through Secretary Alex Azar."
00:19:08 - 00:19:40 (32 sec),"Now a friend of mine who has helped us so much, he's really smart, but I have to say his wife, the last couple of days, has become maybe the biggest star in the family. She's been so -- I said, Rand, you have to get her on television more. She's become the biggest star in the family. Yes. A man that really has been a friend of mine, a special friend, and he's really something."
00:19:40 - 00:20:15 (35 sec),"He's a great guy. Not everybody knows that, believe it or not. Not -- it's like Mitch, not everybody knows that Mitch is a great guy. These are great people. There's something that happens to you when you grow up in Kentucky, I guess, right? These are great people. But, you know, I call Rand a senator of tremendous common sense."
00:20:15 - 00:20:25 (9 sec),"That's a great compliment, common sense. And you know what? Hey, Rand, he's young, he's spry, run up here for a second, Rand. Come up here, Rand."
00:20:25 - 00:21:12 (47 sec),"The president said he's tired. I could take 20 or 30 minutes, right? Now, I'm going to tell you a very quick story about the president, and this shows how he's different than any politician and why you're all out here. I went to him with an idea on health care. I said, let's let individuals buy it in a group."
00:21:12 - 00:21:34 (22 sec),"Let them join an association. Let competition drive prices down. The president said, it's a great idea. What did he staff say? Oh, no, we could never do that. What did all the middle managers say? Oh, we could never do that. And you know what the president said? Make it so. And he did it."
00:21:34 - 00:22:21 (47 sec),"But it's true. We were talking about health care and Rand had this concept that -- he was so far advanced, even the experts didn't know, and after they checked, they said, you know, he's right. He's right. Association health care, where you can team up with other companies, you can team up -- you go in, you get phenomenal pricing, you have no problems with crossing borders, so you get every insurance company, and it's taken off, Rand, and that was Rand's initial idea."
00:22:21 - 00:22:49 (28 sec),"That's true. And it's doing really well. Inexpensive and terrific. And another man, a very special friend of mine, he was a great businessman, decided to win and run in Kentucky. By the way, does that sound familiar? This guy was a really successful guy and he saw things happening in Kentucky, and he said, you know, I can do a tremendous job, and he really has done."
00:22:49 - 00:23:15 (26 sec),"And he doesn't want to be political. He wants to get the job done. This state is doing so well. You have your lowest unemployment numbers in history. You have your best incomes in history. You have jobs and companies flowing back in. And all of that wouldn't matter if I didn't like him, because if I didn't like him, I'd say, forget about him, right?"
00:23:15 - 00:23:59 (44 sec),"But I like him a lot. He's a terrific man and a terrific governor, Matt Bevin. Thank you, Matt. Thanks, Matt. So we're here for a truly special guy. These are all special people. Something about this place. Boy, did we win by a lot. What did we win by, 38? Thirty-eight. We won by a lot. I have a feeling that Mitch McConnell in two years is going to do very good, very good."
00:23:59 - 00:24:16 (17 sec),"He's going to do very good. You know, he goes down as the greatest leader, in my opinion, in history. What we've done is incredible together. But he's better when I'm president than he ever was when anyone else was president. Doing much better. But I want to introduce the leader that we're all here for tonight."
00:24:16 - 00:25:01 (45 sec),"And all of our congressmen know exactly what I'm talking about. He has been so strong on all of the things that we stand for, tax cuts, regulation cuts. Every single event that we passed, and it's record numbers of events, he's been at the forefront, and he's got a little bit of a tough race with a Nancy Pelosi-picked figure."
00:25:01 - 00:25:19 (18 sec),"And I guess they did a little changing, and they did a lot of this and that, the Democrats do, that's the only way they can win. But I'll tell you what, I've seen the -- you know, outside, you have 25,000, 35,000, some crazy number of people, and we set up movie screens. We set up beautiful movie screens."
00:25:19 - 00:25:47 (27 sec),"And to those people outside, we love you. We love you. You have to see the lines, they go all the way back, many miles. But a lot of them stayed and they're watching screens outside. I like your location better, do you agree? But this is a special guy, and normally I wouldn't make a trip, but here I have two reasons."
00:25:47 - 00:26:20 (33 sec),"One was I love the state of Kentucky. And the other was that Andy Barr is a great congressman. Andy, come on up. [Audience Chants Andy]"
00:26:20 - 00:27:07 (47 sec),"Mr. President, welcome to Kentucky's Sixth Congressional District. A swing district that two years ago, you sent a message to the nation because you won it by 15 points. And welcome to Madison County, a county, Mr. President, that you won by a whopping 32 points. Home of Eastern Kentucky University, where we are right now, the most pro-veteran university in America."
00:27:07 - 00:27:50 (42 sec),"Home to workers who relocated from Eastern Kentucky, who value a paycheck to put food on the table, and, Mr. President, thank you for ending the war on coal. And Madison County, home of the Department of Criminal Justice Training, the Kentucky State Police, two awesome police departments, and Democrat Sheriff Mike Coyle, the sheriff of the year, who says, Mr. President, to keep the drugs out of our communities, we need to build the wall."
00:27:50 - 00:28:28 (38 sec),"[Audience Chants Build the Wall] And when I first met you -- when I first met you, Mr. President, I told you about our drug problem in Kentucky, and you listened. And six months later, I was in the White House with you when you declared a national public health emergency to fight the drug epidemic, the opioid epidemic."
00:28:28 - 00:29:09 (40 sec),"And we worked together and we funded the most significant investment to fight a drug crisis in American history. This president is a man of action. A man of action. Other people resist, but this president gets results. And so I want to turn it over to him, but I just want to remember one special night two years ago in Cleveland, the moment I knew this man would be the next president of the United States."
00:29:09 - 00:29:31 (22 sec),"Remember? Remember what he said. He said that my opponent has a slogan, and that slogan is I'm with her. Remember what he said next? What he said was, I have a different slogan, and that slogan is: I'm with you, the American people. Mr. President, I'm with you to fight for the American people!"
00:29:31 - 00:30:12 (41 sec),"Thank you. That's pretty good. Now, you know, the one thing that Andy didn't say is that she paid a lot of money for that slogan. And the morning after I came up with my little feel on it, they changed the slogan. It was gone. It was gone. But we weren't gone, because this was the single greatest movement in the history of American politics."
00:30:12 - 00:30:28 (16 sec),"And our slogan was a great slogan. I think it's the greatest slogan that anybody will ever come up with. Although in two years, we have a new one, you know what that is. Ours is make America great again. Look at all these hats. And at the rate we're going, it's going to happen fast, it's called keep America great."
00:30:28 - 00:31:10 (42 sec),"It's got to be that. Right? So I'm here for Andy Barr. And that's a vote for safe communities, strong borders, and Kentucky values. Andy Barr. A vote for Andy's opponent, I had to do a little checking, who's he running against? Who? This is an extreme liberal named Amy McGrath. Chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, that's a real beauty... and the radical Democrat mob."
00:31:10 - 00:31:51 (41 sec),"Now, Amy supports a socialist takeover of your health care, which by the way means your taxes are going to triple if you're lucky. She supports open borders. She needs the tax hikes to cover the through-the-roof garbage that you want no part of. And she wants to immediately decimate your now-thriving coal industry."
00:31:51 - 00:32:30 (39 sec),"So if you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker of the House -- no, we can't do that. That will not be good. Then you have to get out and vote for Andy Barr, a great man. Great man. You know, actually, I must tell you, Kentucky, you're always involved at the middle of politics. The election of Andy is a very important thing, could make the difference between unbelievable continued success and, frankly, failure, where we fight for two more years with these people, with these obstructionists."
00:32:30 - 00:33:14 (44 sec),"So it's really an important race. It could be the congressman up -- I don't know if they're worried about them. They're so far ahead in their races. We don't have to talk about them anymore, right? We don't have to talk about them. We don't have to talk about them, but we were talking backstage, and they said it. This could be the most important race there is. So get out and vote."
00:33:14 - 00:34:03 (49 sec),"We can't let this happen. A majority of House Democrats have already signed up for socialist health care. By the way, it doesn't work anywhere in the world. Just so you understand. It doesn't work. It's good if you don't mind waiting like five weeks to see a doctor. They come from socialist countries. Frankly, they come from Canada, because they want to use our doctors."
00:34:03 - 00:34:57 (54 sec),"They come from all over the world. And we're making it now better. And they want to destroy everything that's been built, all of that great foundation. They want to outlaw the private insurance plans of 2.4 million Kentucky residents. And some of those plans are fantastic and inexpensive. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for nearly 250,000 Kentucky seniors who depend on it. Republicans want to protect Medicare, and we will, for our great seniors who have earned it and who have paid for it. And Republicans only will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions."
00:34:57 - 00:35:32 (35 sec),"We're going to protect it. The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and it's open borders. Democrats want to abolish ICE and they want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and MS-13 thugs. And don't kid yourself, that's what's going to happen. And they want to get rid of ICE."
00:35:32 - 00:35:56 (23 sec),"They think ICE isn't nice. Did you ever see what they're dealing with? First of all, they're incredible patriots. They have a job that nobody in this group wants. They go in there and they meet the most vile, most vicious people on earth like it's a day at the office. You don't want to do it. You don't want to -- yeah, you might do it. This guy might do it. You want a job?"
00:35:56 - 00:36:25 (29 sec),"I'll get it to you with a -- look at this guy, this guy will do it. I'm looking at -- he might do it. You might do it. But you don't want to do it. They go in there and they liberate towns. These people came in by the thousands, and we're taking them out by the thousands. They're getting out. They're getting out."
00:36:25 - 00:37:01 (36 sec),"Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans -- and you know this, you know this -- Republicans stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. You know that. One by one, we are finding the illegal alien criminals, predators, drug dealers, MS-13 killers, and we are sending them back home."
00:37:01 - 00:37:31 (30 sec),"We are liberating America's cities and towns. That's what we're doing. The only immigration policy Democrats support is catch and release. How about that one? You catch a criminal thug, you take their name, and then you release them, say please show up in five years to court. Now, number one, it's ridiculous."
00:37:31 - 00:38:04 (34 sec),"Number two, they never show up. What a mess. We have the dumbest immigration laws in the world. The world laughs at us, but we're getting them changed. We need some more Republicans. We need some votes. And if you elect Republicans this November, we will pass legislation to end catch and release. We will -- I'll tell you, have you heard the other one?"
00:38:04 - 00:38:42 (38 sec),"Right? Lottery. Lottery. Lottery. OK? Names, you pick them out, coming to the United States. Now, let me ask you, these countries set up lotteries. Do you really believe they're giving us their finest? No. This is a lottery. This was Chuck Schumer's special deal for this country. And we need to elect people so we get rid of it. We got -- maybe just get rid of it. How crazy."
00:38:42 - 00:39:15 (33 sec),"How crazy. How -- and then you have chain migration. You know what that is, right? So we had a man, horrible person, the west side in Manhattan, where I live, where I love, right along the Hudson River. He's driving a car down this roadway where the speed limit is 35. He's going about 70. And he decides to make a right turn into a beautiful park that goes along the river with lots of people."
00:39:15 - 00:39:43 (28 sec),"Many people were killed. Nobody ever talks about the people that were horribly injured. They lost legs, they lost arms. These are people that were running. They want to keep themselves in shape. They were working out. They were walking hand-in-hand together. They're dead. They're horribly wounded. Many will never, ever recover."
00:39:43 - 00:40:14 (31 sec),"Now, what happens? What happened to him? It will be years of litigation. He came in, and then he took chain migration, and he brought his mother, and his father, and his brother, and his sister, and his aunt, and his grandfather. None of them working. It ended up being approximately 22 people who came in. It's called a chain."
00:40:14 - 00:40:59 (45 sec),"Isn't that wonderful? A chain. And we're stuck with them. We're stuck with these people. And I don't want a chain. I want people to come into our country on a merit-based system. And I want them to help all of the great companies that are moving back into the United States. They're moving to Michigan, they're moving to Ohio, they're moving to Pennsylvania, they're moving to North and South Carolina."
00:40:59 - 00:41:25 (26 sec),"They're coming in. They're moving to Florida. And, yes, they're moving into Kentucky. And with what we've done, we've become so successful that we need people to come in with all these companies that are coming in. But we want great people that love our country, that respect our country, and that want to work."
00:41:25 - 00:42:09 (43 sec),"This election is about safety and it is about prosperity. Since the last election -- and these are numbers that the fakers back there, the fake news, would never have allowed me to say. They'd never in a million years, if I ever said this during the campaign, they would've had headlines. We've created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps."
00:42:09 - 00:42:41 (33 sec),"You know what that means? The second, food stamps. It means, number one, we get rid of an unbelievable cost. You wouldn't even believe it. But you know what else? You got a lot of happy people that are working. It's a great thing. It's a great thing. We've added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing's never going to come back?"
00:42:41 - 00:43:16 (34 sec),"Never going to come back, remember? The previous administration, oh, you think that's going to happen? You'd need a magic wand. Well, I guess we had the magic wand. We had the magic wand. And these are great jobs and these are important jobs. Manufacturing jobs, companies pouring back in. Manufacturing. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded in history."
00:43:16 - 00:43:59 (43 sec),"African-American poverty has reached its lowest level in history. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history. I can't believe I'm still saying this. I am so sorry, I apologize to the women in the room. Remember, I got 52 percent -- remember, they kept saying, he's not -- the fake news -- that's right."
00:43:59 - 00:44:43 (44 sec),"Remember he said -- they were all saying he will not do well with women? Wow, did we do well with women. Did we do well. Fake news. We did really well with women. But, unfortunately, the women's unemployment, Mitch, is not at a historic low. It's only the best number in 65 years. We let down women. We let down women."
00:44:43 - 00:45:12 (30 sec),"Sixty-five years, 3.6 percent. As the charts grow just a little bit, it will be historic very soon. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning. You know about winning. You really know about winning. Those horses win. You people are winners. I'm just afraid that Kentucky is winning too much."
00:45:12 - 00:45:40 (28 sec),"[Audience calls out No] You're going to send Matt Bevin to see Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, and they're going to all come to the Oval Office to see me, and they're going to say, Mr. President, we can't do it anymore. Kentucky is winning too much. They can't do it. They don't like it. They don't want to do it anymore."
00:45:40 - 00:46:07 (27 sec),"They're going to say, we're winning so much, we just can't stand it. I'm going to say, Mitch and Matt and Rand, I'm sorry. We're going to keep winning. We're going to win more and more and more. We're going to keep winning. I'm sorry, folks. And I will send them happily back to Kentucky. You're winning a lot."
00:46:07 - 00:46:44 (37 sec),"We won today. We won today with the great pastor, Pastor Brunson. Last week, I announced that we are replacing the horror show, one of the worst trade deals ever made, known as NAFTA, with an incredible, brand-new U.S. Mexico-Canada agreement called the USMCA, USMCA. And even the Democrats are saying, wow, what a good deal that is. They can't believe it. We actually, Mitch, get bipartisan support."
00:46:44 - 00:47:21 (37 sec),"Can you believe it? Although, if it's too good, they won't support it. That's the problem. No, I will say, even Chuck Schumer liked it. Can you believe that one? He said that's a good deal. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices. China -- and I have great respect for China, we all do, and I have great respect and like him for President Xi, the absolute head -- this is an absolute head of China."
00:47:21 - 00:48:03 (42 sec),"But you know what? They've been making $300 billion to $500 billion a year, taking it out of our country. We have rebuilt China. And I don't blame China. They can get away -- I blame our past leaders, because they should never have let it happen. I don't blame China. And thanks to our strong trade and economic policies, Brady Industries recently broke ground on a new billion-dollar aluminum mill that will create up to 1,500 jobs right next to Ashland, Kentucky."
00:48:03 - 00:48:37 (34 sec),"You know where we're talking about, right? Right? Ashland. Under Republican leadership, we also passed the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. Bigger than any have ever been passed. We have taken historic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. You saw three weeks ago, Pfizer, Novartis, a lot of drug companies announced a very substantial increase."
00:48:37 - 00:49:07 (30 sec),"Then I said to Secretary Alex Ocasa -- and I said to Alex Azar, this is no good. This is no good. We got to do something. I want to call them. And I called the head of Pfizer, big company -- I guess like the biggest -- big, big drug company. I called Novartis. I called the heads of these companies, and they said, sir, sir, we will immediately drop the price back to where it was."
00:49:07 - 00:49:35 (28 sec),"Did you ever hear of that? And Rand Paul, it's the first time I realized how powerful it was to be the president of the United States. No, they -- they reduced -- now, I -- and by the way, I kid, but I do, I respect that they did that. I really appreciate it. And now because of what Secretary Azar is doing, you're going to see drug pricing, prescription drugs going down."
00:49:35 - 00:50:04 (29 sec),"You know, we have countries -- we have countries on this planet, the exact same pill, the exact same prescription, made in the exact same factory or plant, in Canada and in other countries all over the world, is much less, sometimes 50 percent, sometimes more than that, it's much less than what Americans pay."
00:50:04 - 00:50:40 (36 sec),"We're getting rid of the middleman. We're doing a number -- I'm going to be hated so much by some people in this country that made a fortune. But we're getting drug prices way down. And we started it last Friday with the signing of two bills. And something that the congressman really helped me with, all of them in the room and Andy, in particular, we help right now get critically ill, terminal patients access to life-saving treatments."
00:50:40 - 00:51:08 (27 sec),"We just passed right to try. Right to try. I hope nobody has to use it in this room. But this is a person who's terminally ill -- we have the greatest drug companies and the greatest research in the world by far, nobody close. But we have a pipeline that would take 12 to 15 years to get it approved and through the pipeline."
00:51:08 - 00:51:32 (25 sec),"We have that down, I think, to four years and maybe less, but we have to be careful. But if we had something that really showed great promise toward a problem that somebody had, who's terminally ill, for 44 years, they've been trying to get this passed. They couldn't. Not as easy as it sounds. Between the insurance companies, the liabilities, the country itself, the lawsuits."
00:51:32 - 00:51:58 (26 sec),"So I got everybody in a room, we got to get life -- this is really important stuff. Excuse me, how many of you know friends? If they have money, they travel all over the world, begging and looking for a cure. They want hope. If they don't have money, they go home, they have no hope. And we got right to try passed a month-and-a-half ago and already it's had an incredible impact."
00:51:58 - 00:52:36 (38 sec),"Incredible impact, 44 years. So now a patient is terminally ill, we have something that's looking really good, we make them sign a document, very important document, and they go in and we work with them and we see if we can help them. And we've had some incredible results already. So I just want to thank Andy Barr and all of the congressmen here and Mitch and Rand, because we got it passed."
00:52:36 - 00:53:17 (40 sec),"We got it passed. But to me that was a big thing. Many, many, many years they worked on it, they couldn't get it done. We also passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor instead of waiting online for 12 days, for 24 days, for 38 days. We have our great veterans -- we're doing a great job with our veterans -- we have our -- but this was one of the most important things -- because they'd be waiting in line for sometimes months if you can believe it. We had people waiting in line and they weren't very sick."
00:53:17 - 00:53:41 (24 sec),"By the time they saw a doctor, they were terminally ill. Now, if there's a line, if there's a way, because we have great doctors in the V.A. That's one thing we -- I'll tell you, everybody tells me. You can't get to them. Now, if there's a wait, you go to a local doctor, you get yourself taken care of, and we pay for the bill."
00:53:41 - 00:54:09 (28 sec),"We pay for the bill. That was another one. That was another one. Took over 40 years. I used to say to people, why don't we do that? I thought I was so smart. I said, listen, I got a great idea. These lines are terrible, 28 days, 30 days. I got a great idea. It's the greatest idea I think I've ever had. We're going to have them go to a private doctor instead of waiting on line."
00:54:09 - 00:54:49 (41 sec),"Sir, we've been trying to get that passed for 40 years. Oh, you've heard about it before? Everybody heard -- they couldn't get it passed. But we're going at getting things passed. We got it passed. Rand and Mitch and Andy, we got it passed. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable."
00:54:49 - 00:55:29 (40 sec),"Jim, you mistreated our veteran, Jim. Jim, you're fired, get out. We just secured $700 billion and $716 billion, two years, to fully rebuild the American military. Bigger, stronger, more powerful than ever before, and we are giving our warriors their largest pay raise in over a decade. And at my direction -- and we need Rand and we need Mitch's help, but it's really popular -- let them know how popular this is -- you know, it's all about space."
00:55:29 - 00:55:48 (19 sec),"It's all about space. Defense, offense, everything, it's going to soon be all about space. So let Rand and Mitch know about this. Ready? At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces known as the Space Force. Now they have to do it. I put them on the spot."
00:55:48 - 00:56:23 (35 sec),"I put them on the spot. Now, they have to do it. No, it's very popular. One of the biggest applause I get wherever I go is when I talk about the Space Force. And, by the way, China, already started. Russia, already started. They've got to start, but we have the greatest people in the world. We make the greatest equipment in the world."
00:56:23 - 00:56:54 (31 sec),"We make the greatest rockets and missiles and tanks and ships in the world. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. You know, when I came to office, weeks before I was given rundowns of what's happening, and Iran was just a question of when will they take over the entire Middle East?"
00:56:54 - 00:57:13 (19 sec),"They're not thinking about that anymore, folks. They're not thinking about it anymore. They've got a little disaster going. They have riots in the street. Their currency is shot. And they'll be coming to us some day, probably not too far out, and they'll say we'd like to make a deal. And that's fine. That's good."
00:57:13 - 00:58:05 (51 sec),"But a real deal. Not the joke of a deal that was made by the past administration. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Right? Together we have made extraordinary progress, but we're just getting started. If you vote to elect Republican House and Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes very, very substantially."
00:58:05 - 00:58:57 (52 sec),"We, unlike the Democrats, will protect Medicare and protect Social Security. Remember what I said during the debates? We will protect them. We will defend your Second Amendment and protect your right to free speech and religious liberty. With your help, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, and all of the people that work so well with us will continue to confirm incredible pro-Constitution judges, not radical far-left judges who will rewrite your Constitution and replace your Kentucky values."
00:58:57 - 00:59:17 (20 sec),"Not going to happen. Eighty-four judges -- think of that, it's a record -- it's a record -- and we actually have a lot to go, 84 judges approved. What a difference. Going to be, by the time we finish, maybe 50 percent of the court. Do you know what that is? Fifty percent. We will fully secure the border."
00:59:17 - 00:59:55 (39 sec),"We will pass Kate's law, stop sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery, end chain migration, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity."
00:59:55 - 01:00:39 (43 sec),"But to achieve this future, to continue the greatest movement in the history of our country and maybe of any country, you need to vote Republican. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for the great people of Kentucky."
01:00:39 - 01:01:28 (49 sec),"And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. On November 6th, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote for Andy Barr. Great man. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, and more products made right here in the good, old USA."
01:01:28 - 01:02:05 (38 sec),"It's about to respect our laws and to respect the heroes of law enforcement. They are heroes. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division, and to celebrate the greatness and the glory of being an American. It is not up to the media, it's not up to the pundits, it's up to you to decide your own fate."
01:02:05 - 01:02:59 (53 sec),"You have the power with your vote to defend your family, defend your country, defend your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country, returning power to the American people. This great state was settled by really -- I mean, how tough, how smart -- by tough, tough men and even tougher women, by the way."
01:02:59 - 01:03:37 (38 sec),"But it was settled by tough men, pioneer women who braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God."
01:03:37 - 01:04:07 (31 sec),"These courageous Kentucky patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage. For the sake of our freedom, and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win."
01:04:07 - 01:04:59 (51 sec),"We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to glorious victory, because we are American, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
01:04:59 - 01:05:23 (24 sec),"And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Vote for Andy Barr."
00:00:00 - 00:00:56 (56 sec),"So this is supposed to be a Democrat state. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. They have a very big surprise coming, don't you think? Very big surprise. Hello, Minnesota. Great state. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in the heartland with thousands of hard-working and truly great American patriots."
00:00:56 - 00:01:35 (39 sec),"You know that. In less than two years of Republican leadership, America has achieved the biggest comeback in our history. True. Jobs are booming, wages are rising and the number of Americans working right now today has reached an all-time high in our history. We are defending our great Second Amendment... taking care of our wonderful veterans, who we love and respect... and our military will soon be more powerful than ever before by far."
00:01:35 - 00:02:23 (48 sec),"But the radical Democrats want to take it all away. They want to destroy our prosperity. We've had great prosperity. You see what's happening. You don't want your 401(k)s being cut in half, and if you vote Democrat, that's what's going to happen. They want to erase our gains and plunge our country into a nightmare of gridlock, poverty, chaos and, frankly, crime, because that's what comes with it. So we're just five weeks away from one of the most important congressional elections in our lifetime."
00:02:23 - 00:02:58 (36 sec),"You see what's happening in Washington right now so you know how important it is. You see what's going on. By the way, look back there, look at all that media. Look at all that media. If we could ever get them on our side, we'd win for a thousand years -- for a thousand years. On Tuesday, November 6th, I need your vote, I need your support to stop radical Democrats and to elect proud Minnesota Republicans."
00:02:58 - 00:03:57 (59 sec),"And we have some great ones right now up for election. This week I announced another historic victory for our nation. We're replacing the job-killing disaster known as NAFTA... with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. It's called the USMCA. That works, right? USMCA. I didn't want to use NAFTA. That has been a disaster for our country: 50,000 plants and factories moving out, millions and millions of jobs lost, one of the worst trade deals ever."
00:03:57 - 00:04:23 (26 sec),"I actually know one that's worse, but I won't tell you, because we're going to be doing something with that too. But NAFTA's been one of the great disasters of all time and now we have a great and fair deal. We have a fair deal, and that's what we want. Great for our workers and really great for our farmers."
00:04:23 - 00:04:44 (21 sec),"It's about time. We're opening it up. The barriers are coming down. And this is tremendous for Minnesota. This is tremendous for Minnesota. And you've waited for a long time. And by the way, we've got plenty coming. You know what's going on with China? They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. But I say they're not ready yet."
00:04:44 - 00:05:08 (24 sec),"They want to make a deal, but I told them, ""You want to make a deal, but you're not ready yet, so we'll talk later."" We have secured landmark protections for the medical innovations being produced right here in your great state. You have great medical in your state. And we've removed unfair trade barriers for our proud Minnesota farmers and our dairy producers like has never, ever been done before in our country."
00:05:08 - 00:05:31 (23 sec),"America is winning again and America is being respected again all over the world right now, and we're going to keep it that way forever. It's called America first. [Audience Chants USA] You even have people sitting behind the flag. That's... It's OK. Great people. And by the way, you got thousands of people outside and you have thousands of people who I just saw in a lovely room, but I said, ""Next time, you have to get here a couple of days earlier."" Right?"
00:05:31 - 00:05:53 (22 sec),"The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. That's really it. Because you're winning. You're winning a lot. There's never been an administration that in already less than two years -- but can you believe we all did this together? We're coming up on two years, can you believe it? There has never been an administration, with you, that's done so much in so little time."
00:05:53 - 00:06:15 (22 sec),"Two years. No administration's come close. None has come close. And we've got a lot coming. If Democrats take over Congress, the stock market will plummet. They will -- it will plummet. You know, there's a reason for it. Every day we hit new highs, new highs. I think we had 103 new highs. Think of it. All time."
00:06:15 - 00:06:49 (34 sec),"That means jobs. To a lot of people, it means great 401(k)s. It means great -- but to a lot of people, it means jobs. It's jobs. Your 401(k)s will be devastated if Democrats take control and our political system will grind to a really messy halt. And you see what's going on in Congress right now with one of the most respected people, potentially, hopefully Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh."
00:06:49 - 00:07:38 (49 sec),"Man... [Audience Chants We Want Kavanaugh] What they're putting him through, and his family. His family is incredible. What they're putting them through. Democrats want to raise your taxes. They want to restore job-killing regulations. There's no administration ever that's cut as many regulations. And we have regulations."
00:07:38 - 00:08:12 (34 sec),"We want clean water. We want crystal, clear air. We want beautiful environment. We want. But you don't have to have regulation that makes it impossible for our country to compete with other countries, and that's what we're doing. The Democrats want to cripple law enforcement. They want to get rid of ICE. How about ICE? ICE, they're tough and they love our country, but you need tough ones."
00:08:12 - 00:08:35 (23 sec),They're tough. They love our country. They get rid of MS-13. They get rid of these gangs. You wouldn't believe it. They throw them the hell out or they bring them to jail. The Democrats embrace socialism. We're not going to be Venezuela -- you see what's happening -- and open our borders to deadly drugs and violent gangs.
00:08:35 - 00:08:57 (22 sec),"And I've said it and I'll say it as many times as you want to hear it, and it's because of their policy: The Democrats are truly the party of crime, because that's what happens. Open borders, that's what happens. And the Dems are willing to do anything to hurt anyone to get the power they so desperately crave."
00:08:57 - 00:09:13 (16 sec),"All they know is how to do -- you know what the words are -- they want to resist, they want to obstruct, they want to delay, demolish, they want to destroy. That's what happens. That's what happens. And just take a look at what's going on. Democrats have been trying to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh... since the very first second he was announced."
00:09:13 - 00:09:59 (46 sec),"And he was announced for one simple reason: He is an incredible intellect, an incredible person, an incredible talent. He's been an incredible judge. Because they know that Judge Kavanaugh will protect, uphold and defend the Constitution of The United States as written. But all you have to do is look at the polls over the last three or four days and it shows that their rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before."
00:09:59 - 00:10:21 (22 sec),"Nobody's ever seen it. Up 11, up 10, up 14. Nobody's ever seen this before. We love it. Do we love it? We love it. Because people see what's happening and they don't like it. The people of Minnesota and the people of America are going to reject the Democrat politics of anger and destruction, and they are going to vote to keep making America great again, greater than ever before."
00:10:21 - 00:10:47 (26 sec),"And in two years, they are going to vote to keep America great, right? Keep America great. We're almost at that point already, but I can't -- I love ""Make America Great,"" but I can't use it in two years. They'll say, ""What have you been doing?"" right? ""What have you been doing?"" Oh, boy, I tell you, it's been a while."
00:10:47 - 00:11:15 (27 sec),"We have had fun, right? We've had fun. This is -- and they don't even correct me when I say it. They don't even correct me. Fake news media. But this is... I mean, look at this stadium. Look, look. As an example, thousands of people in a room next door, thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in, this big stadium is packed, always."
00:11:15 - 00:11:45 (30 sec),"In all fairness to Minnesota, in Las Vegas, in Missouri. You know in Missouri... [Audience Member calls out] Thank you. I love you too, but you're not my type. No, but -- hey, Missouri. They had 44,000 people outside of a big arena. 44,000 people. Las Vegas. We went to -- West Virginia was incredible. West Virginia."
00:11:45 - 00:12:20 (35 sec),"Tennessee. Tennessee, and you see how far Tennessee went up over the last couple of days. It's incredible. Missouri, wow, have we done great. Josh, Josh. So we're thrilled to be joined by a number of your terrific Republican leaders and I just want to introduce somebody that's been such an incredible help to me in getting your tax cuts, I mean, not so bad."
00:12:20 - 00:13:01 (41 sec),How about this? How about this? The Dems want to raise your taxes. We want to lower your taxes. We don't want crime. Crime's OK for them. They want open borders. How the hell do we not win this thing in a landslide every time? How do you... They're for crime and high taxes. We're for low taxes and no crime.
00:13:01 - 00:13:24 (23 sec),"I don't know. Somehow I don't think I would have been a very good politician on the other side of this equation. But a man who really has been helping me a lot, he's a tremendous force in Washington, he's respected by everybody, Congressman Tom Emmer. Minnesota House Speaker Kurt Daudt. Thanks, Kurt. Your state's next attorney general, Doug Wardlow."
00:13:24 - 00:13:57 (32 sec),"Your next governor -- I hear he's doing very well -- Jeff Johnson. We're also joined by the next United States senator from Minnesota, Karin Housley. Karin. So, Karin is running against a far-left Democrat, Tina Smith, who nobody knows who the hell she is. Who is she? She was appointed. She took a wacky guy's place."
00:13:57 - 00:14:34 (38 sec),"That guy was -- he was wacky. Boy, did he fold up like a wet rag, huh? Man. Man, he was gone so fast. He was gone so fast. I don't want to mention Al Franken's name. OK? So I won't mention it. He was gone -- he was gone so fast. It was like, ""Oh, he did something, oh, oh, oh, I resign. I quit, I quit."" Wow. He was gone and he was replaced by somebody that nobody ever heard of. Her name is Tina Smith."
00:14:34 - 00:14:58 (23 sec),"Honestly, you know, I do this stuff for a living. I'm not sure I have ever heard of her [Inaudible]. The fact is, there's no reason for me to have heard of her, because she's never going to vote for us. She'll always vote for Schumer and Pelosi...and, of course, the legendary low-IQ Maxine Waters. Low-IQ person."
00:14:58 - 00:15:25 (27 sec),"She'll be with Schumer, do whatever he wants. ""What would you like me to do? Should I vote for higher taxes?"" ""Yes."" ""Oh, I want higher taxes. Should I vote against the wall?"" Which is happening, folks. She wants to vote against the wall. She voted against the wall. [Audience Chants Build that Wall] So we are building the wall."
00:15:25 - 00:15:52 (28 sec),"We started it. $1.6 billion. Now we got another $1.6 billion and we just got another. But I want to build it at one time, fast. But we're making a lot of progress on the wall. A lot of progress. I'd like to do it a lot faster. I'm good at building. And Tina voted for deadly sanctuary cities. Karin... Karin, do you promise you will not be voting for sanctuary cities, Karin?"
00:15:52 - 00:16:17 (24 sec),"OK. Good. She wants to keep crime out of Minnesota. That sounds like a good platform, right? Tina Smith would rather protect violent criminal aliens than loyal American citizens, which is why Tina Smith, that nobody ever heard of, needs to be voted out of office. She got appointed, I guess. And Tina Smith is voting against Judge Kavanaugh."
00:16:17 - 00:16:37 (20 sec),"Can you believe that one? So, he was number one at Yale, number one at Yale Law School. I think she's looking for a better student. [Laughter] Finally, I want to introduce two incredible -- by the way, Karin, come up, please, will you?"
00:16:37 - 00:17:12 (36 sec),"You really do go off script, don't you? Jeez. Thank you so much for telling everybody. And he said ""Tina Smith"" way too many times. We need to say ""Karin Housley"" a lot more. Thank you."
00:17:12 - 00:17:50 (38 sec),"Vote for her. Vote for Karin. Now for the people that we're here for. Congress is very important, and I'm here to support Congressman Jason Lewis, who you know. He's a friend of mine, who has worked so hard for us and so hard on your Second Amendment, which is under siege, and so hard on cutting your taxes and regulations."
00:17:50 - 00:18:01 (10 sec),"So, Jason, thank you. Come on up, Jason. And the next representative from Minnesota's 1st District, Jim Hagedorn. Come on up, fellas."
00:18:01 - 00:18:45 (44 sec),"Welcome to Minnesota, Mr. President. Now -- now, everybody in this room knows Minnesota loves President Trump. But I will tell you, in 2020, when he comes back here and takes this state, the whole world's going to know Minnesota loves President Trump. And you know what else Minnesota loves, Mr. President?"
00:18:45 - 00:19:18 (33 sec),"They love tax cuts that let you keep more of your money. Now, in the final analysis, that's really it, isn't it? I mean, growth is great, 4.5 percent growth, more job openings than job-seekers, after-tax income up 6 percent in one year. But in the final analysis, whose money is it? It's yours. You ought to have it. Minnesota loves manufacturing, mining and energy production in the 2nd District."
00:19:18 - 00:19:57 (40 sec),"Minnesota loves our farmers now, thanks to the president, who have free trade and fair trade. Right here in Rochester, Minnesota is very proud and loves health care; the kind of plan that you choose, not the plan that government bureaucrats choose for you. And that's why we repealed the Obamacare mandate and the president signed it into law."
00:19:57 - 00:20:41 (44 sec),"And -- and one more thing, Mr. President. Minnesota loves your judicial appointments. That's right. Minnesota loves your appointments to the lower courts, they love your appointments to the appellate courts, and Minnesota loves your appointments to the Supreme Court, including Judge Brett Kavanaugh. My friends, my friends, that's what's at stake in this election: due process, the presumption of innocence, the rule of law, private property, in other words, the Constitution of the United States."
00:20:41 - 00:21:08 (27 sec),"And if Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House, you can throw that all aside. But you know what? The radical resisters have to come through Minnesota first. And this is where it stops. I'm not going to let it happen, Jim Hagedorn isn't going to let it happen, and President Donald J. Trump is not going to let it happen."
00:21:08 - 00:21:09 (1 sec),Thank you all. On to November and let's win there.
00:21:09 - 00:22:23 (74 sec),"Thank you. Wow. Does Rochester, Minnesota, and southern Minnesota love this president? Absolutely. Boy, think back... Think back where we were just two years ago. Our nation's future was on the line. Had we not won that election, we would have lost the country the way the forefathers put it together. And by the grace of God, and we are grateful and proud, Mr. President, that [Inaudible], and thank you for what you're doing for our country."
00:22:23 - 00:23:16 (53 sec),We are. I just want to give the president a quick update on the Democrat Party here in Minnesota. They've moved far to the left like the rest of the Democrats across the country. We actually have a guy running for governor who wants to make Minnesota a sanctuary state. We have -- we have two people running for the United States Senate on the Democrat Party.
00:23:16 - 00:23:46 (31 sec),"They love late-term abortion and they believe in gun control. And we have all these congressional candidates, including the guy I'm running against, who think that we should have socialized medicine, single-payer. Does that make sense for the Mayo Clinic, Rochester? No, no. They want to resist. They want to replace."
00:23:46 - 00:24:12 (26 sec),"They want to take us back to Obama and then some. Are we going to let that happen? Heck no. No. Not going to let that happen. [Audience Responds No] Mr. President, we're going to work tirelessly. And because of your support and leadership and your endorsement, I want to go out to Washington and serve as a conservative reinforcement to partner with you to keep moving America in the right direction."
00:24:12 - 00:24:14 (1 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President."
00:24:14 - 00:24:44 (30 sec),"Wow. Wow. Good talent. So, Jason and Jim are both running against extreme Democrats. Jim's opponent, Dan Feehan... supports a total government takeover of health care, which drives your costs right through the roof and the health care is lousy, by the way. Oh, is that so? And he wants to make Minnesota into -- true -- a sanctuary for the criminal aliens and for gang members."
00:24:44 - 00:25:16 (32 sec),"That's the people -- they will come flooding up here as soon as you do it. It happens every time. Jason's opponent, Angie Craig... Who the hell is Angie Craig? -- also wants to take away your health care. And she refuses to support Enbridge Pipeline. You know all about that. That would bring more than 8,000 jobs to Minnesota."
00:25:16 - 00:25:43 (28 sec),"And you know we've really opened up Minnesota. You see what's going on with the mines and the miners and the ore. Worst of all, a vote for Dan Feehan and Angie Craig is a vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House. Can you imagine Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House? Don't do that to me. I didn't buy into that."
00:25:43 - 00:26:30 (47 sec),"Neither did you. If Democrats take charge, Maxine Waters will also... Now, listen to this one. She's going to take over Financial Services in Congress. Can you believe it? Maxine Waters. That's one of the most powerful committees in Congress. If you want to stop Pelosi from becoming speaker, if you want to stop Chuck Schumer from becoming majority leader... and if you want to stop the radical Democrats from running Congress, then you need to vote Republican."
00:26:30 - 00:26:58 (28 sec),You have to get out there on November 6th and vote Republican. You've got to get it -- and vote for these people. These are great people. A Democrat-controlled Congress would also pose a grave threat to Medicare. You know what they're doing with Medicare? They'll destroy it. The majority of House Democrats have cosponsored a socialist takeover of health care that would obliterate Medicare.
00:26:58 - 00:27:18 (20 sec),"Their plan is called Medicare for All, except they have no money. But it's really Medicare for none. Their plan would rob American seniors of the benefits they have paid -- and they've paid these benefits and they've paid so much money for their entire lives and you take it away. [Audience Member shouts] Thank you, darling."
00:27:18 - 00:27:59 (41 sec),"Love these people. These people are so great. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors, who have earned it and they've paid for it. And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We're going to take care of them. Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions and some people have -- you know what I say?"
00:27:59 - 00:28:30 (31 sec),"We'll get a little more money from China. It'll be just fine. OK? It'll be just fine. We'll be just fine. We're going to take care of pre-existing conditions, folks. Remember that. The lead sponsor of the Democrats -- think of this. The health care takeover, who is the lead sponsor? I've been reading so much about him."
00:28:30 - 00:28:51 (21 sec),"He did predict I was going to win, by the way. I will say that. That's the only thing he's gotten right in a long time. Keith Ellison. Did you know that? No, he did. That's right. He was on a show the day after I announced. On June 16th, I came down the stair with Melania -- who's right now in Africa, our first lady."
00:28:51 - 00:29:11 (20 sec),"She's doing a great job. Doing a great job for the people of Africa. Amazing. But Ellison was on a show the day after I announced and he looked at two people, the hosts, he said, ""You know he's going to win, don't you?"" And they smiled. One laughed. They spoke. They thought I was just doing this for fun."
00:29:11 - 00:29:41 (30 sec),"You think this is fun? You think this... This is a lot of work. It's a lot more work than anybody knew. And that's the last time he's been right, but I'm glad he was right about that. Ellison is the number two official in the entire Democrat Party and he recently marched in a parade wearing a shirt that read, ""I do not believe in borders."" Oh, that's wonderful."
00:29:41 - 00:30:20 (39 sec),"By the way, you don't have borders, you don't have a country, folks. You don't have a country. Keith Ellison's Democrat Party embraces radical socialism and open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. They want to unleash violent predators and ruthless killers -- and you know it. Somebody would say, ""Oh, gee, why is he saying that?"
00:30:20 - 00:30:46 (25 sec),"That's not"" -- it's true. Like MS-13, near our schools, near our families and into our communities. No good. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans proudly stand with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol and law enforcement, our police."
00:30:46 - 00:31:18 (33 sec),"Great people. They do an incredible job. My administration has also reformed our refugee program to protect American communities like you have in Minnesota, where you're being treated very unfairly, and to protect your families and your taxpayer dollars. If you want security, if you want a border, then what you have to do is immediately go out, think about it, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your workers."
00:31:18 - 00:31:39 (21 sec),"You've got to go November 6th, vote Republican. That'll do it. That'll do it. We need the votes. You know, I keep hearing we have a majority. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority. If somebody's not feeling great, we don't have a majority. It's like -- it's like the saying -- that's why we're getting the wall by hook, by crook, we're getting the wall, but it's so difficult."
00:31:39 - 00:32:07 (28 sec),"These guys want to stop it. They want to say -- you know, it's interesting. We've got $700 billion for the military, which is, you know, many, many, many times -- we've got $716 billion for the military. We are rebuilding our military. But to get money for the wall, their whole life is trying to obstruct the wall because they know we want it. But you know what?"
00:32:07 - 00:32:34 (27 sec),"It's not working. I'd like to do it a lot faster, but it's not working. We're getting the money. You think it's easy? Not easy. But we're getting it built and it's already going up in San Diego and lots of other places along the border. [Audience Chants Build that Wall] This election is about safety and it's about prosperity."
00:32:34 - 00:33:02 (27 sec),"Since the election, we have created over 4 million new jobs. The media will tell you there was no way we could have said that during the campaign. Nobody would have believed it. And we've lifted 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Think of that. You know, when you do that, you save a lot of money and you also make a lot of people really happy."
00:33:02 - 00:33:23 (22 sec),"When you think about it, right? We've added nearly a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, ""You need a magic wand. You'll never do that."" I said, ""What happens? We don't build anything anymore?"" And we have companies pouring into our country and they're coming to Minnesota. They're coming to a lot of states."
00:33:23 - 00:33:51 (28 sec),"But we have companies. They're all coming back. They want to be where the action is. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. The auto companies. I was with Prime Minister Abe two days ago. He said, ""Many of our auto companies are coming back."" I said, ""No, no, that's not good enough. All of them have to come back."
00:33:51 - 00:34:17 (26 sec),"All."" And he's going to do that. They're all coming back. They've already started. You look at Michigan, what's going on in Michigan, where they're coming back so fast -- but they're coming back to Ohio. They're coming back to Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina. And they're coming in to a place called Minnesota."
00:34:17 - 00:34:46 (29 sec),"Do we love Minnesota? 1972. You know what that is, right? That was the last time -- and boy, we came, like, this close. One more speech up here and I would have won this state. I came -- do you remember? I said, ""I think I'm going to win Minnesota,"" and everyone said, ""No, no, it hasn't been won since 1972."" Is that right? 19 -- right?"
00:34:46 - 00:35:20 (34 sec),"The Congress [Inaudible], right? Yeah. 1972. It hasn't been won. I said, ""No, look at the crowds. They love it. We're going to take care of Minnesota. We're going to stop what's happening that's so unfair in Minnesota."" And then on election night, I said, ""Let's go to Minnesota,"" but they already scheduled for a great place, a great state, Michigan."
00:35:20 - 00:35:40 (19 sec),"That's another one hadn't been won in many, many years. I went to Michigan. We had 32,000 people in Michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning. It was already Election Day. So I had to skip Minnesota. I felt so badly because one more speech -- I could have showed up at 3 o'clock in the morning maybe. I don't know."
00:35:40 - 00:36:08 (28 sec),"But we're going to win. We're going to win Minnesota. And you see that just by this crowd. Look at this crowd. This place is... So something I'm very proud of, African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. Think of those two sound bites."
00:36:08 - 00:36:39 (31 sec),"The lowest unemployment, the lowest rate of poverty. So think of this: How does your African-American, how do you vote for somebody else? I've done more for them in two years. African-Americans are coming up and they're saying, ""Mr. President, thank you. Thank you."" And their median income is the highest."
00:36:39 - 00:36:56 (17 sec),"But not only for African-Americans, for Asian, for Hispanic. Hispanic unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. Think of it. Asian unemployment, the lowest it's ever been. People with no high school diploma -- that's a very important group of people to me -- it is by far the lowest it's ever been. Women I'm failing with."
00:36:56 - 00:37:19 (22 sec),"I am failing with women. It's only the lowest in 65 years. Sorry. Sorry. I thought it would be history by now, because I've been saying African-American, I've been saying Hispanic, I've been saying Asian, I've been -- and women, it's only the lowest in 65 years. But I thought by now, it would be OK. [Audience member calls out] Got a lot of energy, this one over here."
00:37:19 - 00:38:03 (45 sec),"She's got a lot of energy. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Sixty-five years, not bad, but soon it's going to be in history, I predict. My administration has taken the toughest-ever action cracking down on China's trading abuses. We have to stop it. And we have a very good relationship with President Xi. I have a very good relationship."
00:38:03 - 00:38:42 (38 sec),"But we can't allow what's happened over so many years to continue happening. They've been taking $500 billion, with a B, out of our country and rebuilding China. And I said, ""We can't do that anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" For years, China has been draining us, taking our factories and building up their country with our money, and at the expense of our workers and our companies."
00:38:42 - 00:39:07 (25 sec),"And we're not going to have it. No more. And not only China. Many countries. Look, many countries. We defend countries that are very rich. They don't pay us or they pay us a small percentage. I mean, look, we get along great with these countries, but take Saudi Arabia. Would you say they have some money?"
00:39:07 - 00:39:48 (42 sec),"So we defend them and they pay a small percentage. I said, ""Excuse me, King Salman"" -- he's my friend -- ""do you mind paying for the military?"" ""Do you mind? Hey."" They're paying for 30 percent. I said, ""Do you mind paying?"" ""But nobody has asked me."" I said, ""But I'm asking you, King."" He says, ""Great."" He said, ""But are you serious?"" I said, ""No, I'm totally serious."
00:39:48 - 00:40:16 (28 sec),"Trust me."" [Laughter] And they'll do it. He said nobody's ever asked him. You're talking about -- by the way, you're talking about billions and billions of dollars. Japan, ""No, President Obama would never have asked. That's not his kind of thing. Not his thing."" Why would somebody ask to be paid back billions of dollars?"
00:40:16 - 00:41:00 (44 sec),"Japan, very rich, very great country. I told you, Prime Minister Abe, great man. Just won a fantastic election. Big results. I have an -- an incredible relationship. I said to him, ""Listen, we're defending you."" We're doing a great job. They were sending missiles over Japan from North Korea. Because of me, those missiles aren't going over Japan anymore."
00:41:00 - 00:41:24 (24 sec),"There are no more missiles, no more testing, no more nuclear. We got our hostages back. We got the remains of our great heroes back, right? The remains. The remains are coming back. That was the most beautiful ceremony. Did anybody see that ceremony a month ago? So beautiful. And the remains are coming back."
00:41:24 - 00:41:56 (31 sec),"And what do I get? I get the fake news saying, ""Why isn't he moving faster?"" I just left -- what? -- three months ago. I had a meeting in Singapore. I mean, this has been going on for 75 years -- now let's say 25 years with the missiles and the nuclear -- but no president's done anything. It's -- it's like, three months."
00:41:56 - 00:42:31 (35 sec),"And they'll say, the all-time great, ""What's taking so long?"" I said, ""It's been three months and you don't have rockets and you don't have missiles and you don't have nuclear testing and we get all of our"" -- I mean, it's crazy. But here's what they say. So, they can't get me. One of them actually said -- a nice guy, a friend of mine."
00:42:31 - 00:43:15 (44 sec),"He actually said, ""Why is the president giving so much to North Korea?"" I said, ""I haven't given anything. What have I given?"" I haven't paid -- I didn't pay $1.8 billion for the hostages like Obama did... with Iran, remember? $1.8 billion in cash. Gave them $150 billion. So I haven't given. But I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim. I have a very good relationship."
00:43:15 - 00:43:44 (29 sec),"So because of that relationship, let's see. I think we'll work something out. Maybe we won't. Who knows? It's a deal. Let's see. But so far -- so I'm -- when did I leave, like three months ago, three and a half months ago, maybe less? And they're saying, ""He agreed to meet,"" because they -- I didn't give -- so you know what I gave them?"
00:43:44 - 00:44:29 (45 sec),"I agreed to meet. That's what they say. I agreed to meet. Is that a big deal? I agreed to meet. I asked the Democrats before -- you know, we were close to a war with North Korea, I'll you what. And my rhetoric was very tough at the beginning. It was really, really tough. In fact, they all said I'm going to cause a war with North Korea."
00:44:29 - 00:44:49 (21 sec),"I'm going to cause a war. And then with Putin of Russia, they said, ""He was too nice."" He was -- that was a great meeting. We had a very successful -- so they want me to get into a boxing match with him. I think I'd do very well. But with Russia... [Audience Chants USA] No, no. It's the fake news. Fake news."
00:44:49 - 00:45:08 (19 sec),"They said with Russia, ""He was too nice. He was too nice."" With North Korea, they said, ""He was too tough. He was too tough."" And let me tell you, if I was really rough with Russia, they'd say, ""He was too tough. He was too tough."" These people are loco, I'm telling you. Loco. [Laughter] People are crazy."
00:45:08 - 00:45:33 (24 sec),"Fake news. The fake news, everybody. They are fake. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation, right? To give our workers and businesses a level playing field, Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. Better vote for Karin."
00:45:33 - 00:45:57 (25 sec),"They want to take them away. They want to take them away. We've taken historic action to make health care more affordable and we've gotten rid of the soaring premiums. You know, the premiums on Obamacare -- nobody realized it. They were going up 116 percent, 138 percent, 200 percent. Through great management and great people, we've kept them down."
00:45:57 - 00:46:25 (27 sec),"We've mostly obliterated Obamacare, although we had it won except for 2 o'clock in the morning -- I say it again -- 2 o'clock in the morning and I was like -- I'm not going to do it. Two o'clock in the morning. But think of it differently: We didn't get one Democrat vote so we're stuck with it, but it's obliterated."
00:46:25 - 00:46:56 (31 sec),"And the big thing is, we got rid of the most unpopular part of Obamacare. It's called the individual mandate, where you have the privilege of paying a fortune so that you don't have to pay a fortune for horrible health care, right? So, the premiums in Minnesota this year are coming down by double digits."
00:46:56 - 00:47:31 (35 sec),"Think of that. And I don't even like this stuff, but while we have the remnants of Obamacare, we're working to make it much more affordable than you had. And to reduce drug prices, the FDA has approved a record number of affordable generic medicines. And that's not all. Drug prices are coming down. You might have seen last month where I called up some of the drug companies."
00:47:31 - 00:48:09 (37 sec),"I said, ""Folks, you just raised up the drug prices. You can't do that."" And they all reduced them. Do you believe it? That's when I said, ""I've a lot of power."" Pfizer, right? You saw that. Pfizer, Novartis, they raised their drug prices and I'm bringing them down. I said, ""What are you doing with raising them?"" ""I'm sorry, Mr. President, we'll reduce them immediately."" I said, ""Man, this is a powerful position."
00:48:09 - 00:48:51 (43 sec),"I never..."" First time in the history of drug companies that they've done that. They literally announced it. I called them the next day. I told them I was extremely unhappy and they said, ""We're going to reduce it."" Who the hell does that? Do you think Hillary Clinton would have done that? [Audience Responds No] I don't think so. I don't think so. [Audience Chants Lock her up] By the way, she or whoever it might have been, crazy Bernie, whoever they put in, they wouldn't have done any of the things -- we did the greatest trade deal."
00:48:51 - 00:49:15 (23 sec),"Look at the money. We did 4.2 percent GDP. They were going down. They would have had a minus four point. They -- they said 4.2 percent is impossible. It's going to go higher, much higher. We have such potential. Between military and trade deals, we have hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fat and potential."
00:49:15 - 00:49:37 (22 sec),"And what I love -- what I love, hopefully you don't need it for a long time or never, to help critically ill patients get life-saving treatments, we passed Right to Try. I love it. I hope you don't need it. I hope I don't need it, too. I hope you don't need it. But that's -- you know, we have the greatest -- frankly, the greatest drug companies in the world."
00:49:37 - 00:50:27 (50 sec),"And we would have drugs that would take four or five years -- you know, we've brought it down from 14 years to get approved down to four. I think we'll be at three or two. But still, you've got to wait a long time. And a person who is dying, a person is terminally ill and they have a great, you know, possible cure, and so a person wants to see if they could possibly -- you couldn't get it. There was no way of getting it. No way in a million years."
00:50:27 - 00:51:09 (42 sec),"I worked with Congress, including these guys and... and Greg. And Greg, right? And Jim and Mark and the whole group. But we worked with Congress and we got it done. I love the name, Right to Try. Now, they can go, they sign a paper. You have no idea: They've been trying to get this for 40 years. You know, who would think?"
00:51:09 - 00:52:12 (63 sec),"They've been trying for 40 years. And it is, you have problems with insurance companies. You have problems with trials. You have problems with so many different things. You have problems with everything. Everything is there -- and you have problems with liability. I said, ""Sign a document that there's no liability."" They don't want to give something, the person dies and then the family sues the country."
00:52:12 - 00:52:39 (27 sec),"That's no good. So you sign away your rights if you take it. And you know what happened? Everybody said, ""Wow, that's a good idea."" Can you believe this? So after 40 years, we have it. And now people are trying it. And you know what? We've had some incredible results. And it's also telling you whether or not this stuff works."
00:52:39 - 00:53:00 (21 sec),"There's something good about that, too. We've had some incredible results, right? I love it. People would fly to other continents, they'd fly to other countries. If they were poor they'd just go away. They'd had no hope. They'd go to their house or their apartment and they'd have no hope. Now, they have hope."
00:53:00 - 00:53:38 (38 sec),"It's beautiful. It's so great. We also passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor... see a private doctor instead of waiting in line. I mean, we had people waiting for three weeks, two weeks, 12 days, nine weeks. We had people that were not very sick. It took them so long to see the private doctor, to see a doctor, a veterans doctor -- and they're good doctors."
00:53:38 - 00:54:07 (30 sec),"We really do, we have great doctors -- but it's a long process. So they're not very sick. By the time they'd see the doctor 22 days later, they'd be terminally ill. Think of it. They would die. They would die on line waiting. They now have the right to go to a private doctor and we pay the bill. Forty-four years they've been trying to get it. I thought that was my idea."
00:54:07 - 00:54:40 (33 sec),"I came back, ""I got the greatest idea."" I said to all my medical people, ""I got the greatest idea. It's taken too long. We could never solve this problem. Too many people, too few doctors. They're great doctors, but you can't get to them. I got the greatest -- we're going to have the people go to a private doctor and we're going to pay for it."" And they said, ""Sir, we've been working on this for 44 years."" But I got it approved because I'm good at getting things approved, right?"
00:54:40 - 00:55:04 (24 sec),"Right? All done. All done. And these people helped me. Right there. They helped me with it. Right there. And we also passed landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable. We say, ""Jim, you're fired. Out. Get out. Get out."" We had no right to do it. Between the unions and the civil servants, they could do anything."
00:55:04 - 00:55:27 (23 sec),"They could be sadists -- and they were. They were sadists. These are sick people. They -- they could be sadists. They could be stealing. They could be robbing you blind. They could be doing anything. You couldn't fire them. They were totally protected. Now, you just fire them. Get them out. We have secured a record $716 billion to rebuild our military and give our brave warriors their largest pay raise in a decade."
00:55:27 - 00:56:03 (36 sec),"And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working -- I'm so excited about this -- to create the sixth branch, number six, of the American armed forces, called the Space Force. We have the Air Force. Now we have the Space Force. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear disaster deal."
00:56:03 - 00:56:34 (31 sec),"And we've opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Presidents have been promising that for many, many decades and I finally know why, because I was hit so hard when they heard I was going to do it. I got calls from every country in the world. ""Please, don't do it."" And I told you the story. I said, ""Look, I don't want to take any calls from any leaders of any countries."
00:56:34 - 00:56:52 (18 sec),"Tell them I'll call them back."" We were going to have it signed on a Monday. Big ceremony. I said, ""Tell them I'll call them back next week."" [Laughter] Because they were calling me and they were saying, ""Mr. President, please don't do that. Please. Please."" So I know why Obama and Bush and everybody didn't do it. I mean, I understand."
00:56:52 - 00:57:27 (35 sec),"There was a lot of pressure put on them. So I just said, ""Tell them I'll call them back next week."" So on Monday I signed it, and then on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday I called everybody back. ""Hi, how are you doing? What's up?"" [Laughter] ""Well, we didn't want you to do..."" I said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. Gee, it's too late."" I said, ""What can I do? What can I do?"" ""What can I do?"" For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
00:57:27 - 00:58:28 (61 sec),"Now you have a president who is standing up for America... more than ever before. [Audience Chants USA] We're standing up for your values, we're standing up for Minnesota and we are standing proudly for our national anthem. All right. I'll give you a quick story that they don't know. They've never heard."
00:58:28 - 00:58:47 (19 sec),"It's hard to believe; I thought they knew everything about me. So in making the deal with Mexico and then Canada, -- as you know, Canada was very tough, but that they worked out fine. And the NFL -- because we talk about the flag and the -- I'm not happy about it with the NFL. OK? I'm not happy, if it's OK with you guys -- is it OK with you?"
00:58:47 - 00:59:16 (30 sec),"Not happy. People should stand proudly for our national anthem and for our flag. So I'm not happy. I'm not happy. But that seems to be working out. Do you notice? That's seems to be working out very good. But to show you -- so we're making the deal with Canada. And it's big stuff. You know, it's cars and it's farming and it's agriculture and it's factories and it's big, big dollars."
00:59:16 - 00:59:38 (22 sec),"Tremendous. They say it's the largest trade deal ever made, $1.3 trillion. But I heard that the NFL had a big problem with Canada on their advertising, on the commercials. A big, big problem. I'm not going to get into what it was, but it was a very bad problem and it went on for years and it was really hurting the NFL. Now, I don't care."
00:59:38 - 00:59:53 (15 sec),"I like some of the people. I don't like some of the -- it doesn't matter. It's an American company. It's a great American company. So during the negotiation I said, ""You've got to fix the NFL problem."" They said, ""What?"" I said, ""You've got to fix the NFL problem."" Took me two minutes and now the NFL is so happy it's all worked out."
00:59:53 - 01:00:15 (21 sec),It's all worked out. They don't know that. It's all worked out. We've got to fix it. And now our country will be taking tens of millions of dollars more money. It's going to go -- a lot of it's going to go to the players and they'll still hate me. Can you believe it? But you know what? Think of it. It took me two minutes.
01:00:15 - 01:00:39 (24 sec),"You've got to fix the problem. It's because -- not because I love them or don't like them. I do like them. It's a great American company. I said, ""You've got to fix the NFL problem. It's unfair what you do to them during the Super Bowls. Very unfair."" And I got a call from Roger Goodell. No, very nice. And I figured he was calling about the flag."
01:00:39 - 01:01:05 (27 sec),"Like, to say, ""Could you leave us alone, please?"" [Laughter] And he wasn't. He said, ""Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for what you did. You solved a problem that was going on for years."" The Obama administration couldn't do it. Nobody could do it. Nobody could get it done. I did it in two minutes. It was like, ""You've got to do it. We've got to do it."" It was a tiny, little part of the deal."
01:01:05 - 01:01:26 (20 sec),"I figured, ""What the hell? It was like two sentences."" But it was very nice. Roger Goodell called me and then Bob Kraft, who owns -- who's a great owner. Now, it's great to have Coach Belichick and Tom Brady, that's a good thing, right? I always say, ""Bob, you're a great owner and you're one of the luckiest men on Earth."
01:01:26 - 01:01:41 (16 sec),"You took Tom Brady in the sixth round, right? And you have the greatest coach in football."" That's a good thing and he's a great guy. But he called me to thank me and Roger Goodell called to thank me. Very nice. And we're all friends. I want what's good for the country. People said to me... True. One of my killers called up. We have very tough negotiators, very smart guys."
01:01:41 - 01:01:55 (14 sec),"We have, like, the A Team of the world. And he said, ""You know, we could have that -- that NFL thing. I heard about it for years."" Everybody heard about it, what they were doing. I said -- I said -- they said, ""You know, I think we could fix that NFL deal for you."" I said, ""Let's fix it."" They said, ""Really?"
01:01:55 - 01:02:16 (21 sec),"You want to do that?"" I said, ""No. They're a great American company. They're going to pay tax on that money. They're going to pay the money to people that work and live in our country. Fix the deal."" They were surprised. I said, ""Fix it."" They fixed it and it was a nice thing. OK, enough of that. That's enough of that."
01:02:16 - 01:02:32 (16 sec),"True. So the NFL, good company, great, great people. We're lifting millions of our citizens -- and you know this -- from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And a lot of people are coming out of prisons and they're able to get jobs now."
01:02:32 - 01:02:53 (21 sec),"Isn't that great? They're getting a second chance and even a third chance and they're getting jobs. And people that are hiring many of these prisoners are saying unbelievable how good they are. It's so beautiful to see. And before, they wouldn't have a chance. People didn't want to hire them. They're hiring people coming out of prison and these people are stepping up. I have a friend that hired many, quite a few, and he said, ""I can't say every one,"" but he said, ""These people are unbelievable."
01:02:53 - 01:03:18 (25 sec),"They're so hard-working. We've given them a second chance."" It's a -- to me, it's a beautiful thing. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends and get your family and get your neighbors and your coworkers and get out, and you have to -- November 6th, you have to go out and vote Republican."
01:03:18 - 01:03:56 (39 sec),"Send Jason Lewis and Jim Hagedorn to the House. And vote to send Karin Housley... Get Karin Housley into the Senate. We need her. We need her vote. We need her. She's going to be fantastic. Forget about Tina. Karin, they're going to get you in. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation and more products made right here in the good old USA. That's what we want."
01:03:56 - 01:04:29 (33 sec),"It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and to love and respect the heroes of law enforcement. Great. They're great. They're great people. No easy job. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division and destruction -- it's destruction -- and to unite together as citizens, as patriots and as Americans."
01:04:29 - 01:05:06 (37 sec),"To everyone in this beautiful, big, rich room, to every citizen watching across our land, this is your time to choose. It's a time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past, or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. It's not up to the media or to the pundits to decide your fate."
01:05:06 - 01:05:38 (32 sec),"It's up to you. This was the greatest movement, 2016, all of those hats, Make America Great Again. Look at them. Amazing. Amazing. It's the greatest movement in the history of our country. It is. I mean, there's never been a movement like this. There's never been a movement like this. As an example, the presidential election is not for two and a half years."
01:05:38 - 01:06:05 (27 sec),"Look at this room. Look at this. Look outside. This is not a normal situation. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country and they know it. And they don't even challenge me when I say it, because if I was wrong, there would be headlines. ""Donald Trump..."" [Laughter] It's up to the proud people of our country and the very proud people of Minnesota, a great state."
01:06:05 - 01:06:49 (44 sec),"You have the power with your votes to defend America's honor and reclaim America's future. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. Together, we are taking back our country, returning power to the American people. This state was settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women... who braved the wilderness to build a life and to build a home."
01:06:49 - 01:07:27 (38 sec),"They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country and they loved their god. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to tear down their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage."
01:07:27 - 01:07:59 (32 sec),"For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory."
01:07:59 - 01:09:19 (80 sec),"Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together we will make America wealthy again... make America strong again... we will make America safe again... and we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:01:05 (65 sec),"Hello, Mississippi, hello. Beautiful. [Audience Chants USA] Well, I have to start by saying that 2020 is looking really easy, isn't it? I think the fake news media back there is starting to get it, folks. I think they're starting. They're starting to understand what's going on. And I'm thrilled to be back in this great state, with thousands of proud, loyal, hard-working American patriots."
00:01:05 - 00:01:41 (36 sec),"Thank you. In less than two years, we've achieved the biggest comeback in American history. That's what's happened. The economy is booming. Wages are rising. And more Americans are working today than ever before. Today -- ever before. Think of it. Now, just think of that. Today, we have more Americans working than we've ever had in the history of our country, right now, today."
00:01:41 - 00:02:20 (39 sec),"How great is that, right? We're defending our Second Amendment, protecting religious liberty, taking care of our great veterans... and rebuilding America's military like it hasn't been rebuilt ever before. This week, we made history again when I announced that we are replacing the job-killed disaster known as NAFTA with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement."
00:02:20 - 00:03:16 (56 sec),"A good one. And it's a good one. We're calling it USMCA. You're going to like that name. That'll become a part of your vocabulary. USMCA. Companies aren't going to be leaving us anymore and firing everybody and sending their product back into the United States with no tax. That was what I wanted. You know, Mississippi, when they leave and they go next door and they fire everybody and they build the product and send it back and sell it to the same people that were buying it before -- no, we don't want to do that anymore."
00:03:16 - 00:03:47 (31 sec),"No we don't want to do that anymore. It's not a good -- that's not a good thing to do. Although there is a group called globalists. They think it's just fine. Not fine. They're globalists. [Inaudible] globalists. We don't like the thinking of the globalists. The USMCA is an incredible victory for our farmers, our ranchers, our factory workers, and our entire nation."
00:03:47 - 00:04:20 (33 sec),"America is winning again, and America is being respected again, maybe respected like never before, because we are finally putting America first. But exactly five weeks from today, all of this extraordinary progress is at stake. It is at stake. I'm not on the ballot, but in a certain way, I'm on the ballot, so please go out and vote."
00:04:20 - 00:04:57 (37 sec),"Go out and vote. On November 6th, you will head to the polls -- hopefully -- in one of the most important congressional elections of our lifetime. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. A Democrat takeover of Congress will plunge our country into gridlock and chaos like you haven't seen before."
00:04:57 - 00:05:25 (28 sec),"It'll come to a halt. And I have to tell you, all of those people, with your savings accounts and your money piled up in your bank, it's all -- a lot of it's going to disappear, and it'll disappear really fast. Your 401(k)s -- I stand up all the time with great Americans. ""Sir, I'd like to thank you. My wife thinks I'm one of the greatest investors in the world."
00:05:25 - 00:06:05 (40 sec),"And two years ago, she thought I was a total loser, sir. Now she loves me so much."" ""Because my 401(k)..."" ""... has gone up 55 percent, sir, since you got elected! 55 percent!"" Ah, it's amazing. You can really get your wife to like you a lot when that happens. You've got to be really bad. I'll tell you. And that's happening."
00:06:05 - 00:06:33 (28 sec),"And it goes the other way, too. That happens. People are geniuses now. And we've helped. You know, we had probably -- and even the fake news would tell you -- the greatest victory in the history of this country in 2016. There's never been anything like that. The people came from the hills and the valleys."
00:06:33 - 00:07:05 (32 sec),"They came from all over. And they voted, voted, voted. And they love Trump, and they loved us. Because it wasn't me, it was all of us. It was all of us. And that's what's happening. That's what's happening. But it's all fragile. The Democrats will open our borders to deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The Democrats -- and I say this -- and I've dealt with it -- the Democrats are the party of crime."
00:07:05 - 00:07:41 (36 sec),"And that's what it is, they're the party of crime. Radical Democrats want to tear down our laws, tear down our institutions in pursuit of power, demolish our prosperity in the name of socialism and probably worse... and abolish our borders in the service of globalism. There is nothing Democrats aren't willing to do, and you're seeing it day by day, and you've seen it more the last week than you've ever seen it before."
00:07:41 - 00:08:07 (26 sec),"And no one -- just think of this. No one under any circumstances is allowed to speak up if you're on this side of the equation. But guess what? We're speaking up like nobody has ever spoken up before. They want to get the power that they so desperately crave that was taken away from them. All of the Democrats know and all they really know how to do is obstruct, resist, demolish, destroy and delay."
00:08:07 - 00:08:25 (17 sec),"They've been trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced... because they know Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written. [Audience Chants We Want Kavanaugh] You know, for 10 years, I don't know him, I never met him, but I'd been hearing there's this guy named Brett Kavanaugh who is... who is like a perfect person, who is destined for the Supreme Court."
00:08:25 - 00:09:03 (39 sec),"I've heard that for a long time. And -- a lot of smart people. And first in his class at Yale. Top, top in his class at Yale Law School. He'd led, like, a life that's unbelievable. He's had no problems. They've never taken him out of restaurants. They've never -- this is like a person that everybody thought at the highest level on both sides, they said, ""Someday he will be a Supreme Court judge."" Right?"
00:09:03 - 00:09:40 (36 sec),"He will be a justice of the Supreme Court. And all my life, I've heard that the most important thing that a president has to do as president is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice and... And I disagree. I think war. I think our military. I think peace. I think those things are -- you know, those things are pretty important, right?"
00:09:40 - 00:10:02 (22 sec),"That's pretty important. They don't say that, but I say those things are pretty important. But I'll have to tell you, the appointment of a Supreme Court justice -- and I look at him, and I looked at the man that we appointed just before him, Justice Neil Gorsuch... who was put through the paces, but nothing like what's happening now."
00:10:02 - 00:10:31 (29 sec),"It's just crazed. It's crazy. What's happening now, they had gang rape. A gang rape. Many times. Well, that turned out to be false. So many different charges. Guilty until proven innocent. That's very dangerous for our country. That's very dangerous for our country. And I have it myself all the time. But for me, it's like a part of the job description."
00:10:31 - 00:11:18 (47 sec),"[Laughter] Let it happen to me. Shouldn't happen to him. Shouldn't happen to him. What he's going through: 36 years ago, this happened. ""I had one beer."" Right? ""I had one beer."" ""Well, you think it was..."" ""Nope, it was one beer."" ""Oh, good. How did you get home?"" ""I don't remember."" ""How did you get there?"" ""I don't remember."" ""Where is the place?"" ""I don't remember."" ""How many years ago was it?"" ""I don't know."
00:11:18 - 00:11:44 (26 sec),"I don't know. I don't know."" ""I don't know."" ""What neighborhood was it in?"" ""I don't know."" ""Where's the house?"" ""I don't know."" ""Upstairs, downstairs, where was it?"" ""I don't know. But I had one beer, that's the only thing I remember."" And a man's life is in tatters. A man's life is shattered. His wife is shattered."
00:11:44 - 00:12:15 (31 sec),"His daughters, who are beautiful, incredible young kids -- they destroy people. They want to destroy people. These are really evil people. And then you see... And then you see the people that are doing it. I know every one. I could tell you things about every one of them. Da Nang Richard Blumenthal. This guy lied about his service."
00:12:15 - 00:12:36 (20 sec),"He didn't just say, ""Gee, I was in the service."" No. He said, ""I was in the Marines. Da Nang Province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill."" This went on for 15 years when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. I thought he was a great war hero. And then it turned out he was never in Vietnam."
00:12:36 - 00:13:13 (38 sec),"He was in the Reserves! And I watched him two days ago. I watched him saying, ""We need the truth. If we don't have"" -- and here's a guy who was saying people were dying all around him and he was never there. And then he cried. When they caught him, he cried like a baby. [Laughter] Like a baby. When Jimmy Swaggart cried, it was nothing compared to Da Nang Richard."
00:13:13 - 00:13:47 (34 sec),"Nothing. Jimmy Swaggart was nothing compared to -- he cried, ""Oh, oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so"" -- he only lied for 15 years. And now we get something. And now he talks about lying. And this man's not lying. So Blumenthal is a fraud. He's a fraud. And the reason he got elected is because in Connecticut it's impossible for a Republican to get elected."
00:13:47 - 00:14:22 (35 sec),"And I did well there. But you can't. He actually gave up the race. You'd thought he lost. You remember that? He, sort of, gave -- he stopped campaigning. It was over. And then he won by three points. And we have him in the Senate. And now he's this great honorable guy, because you know why? The fake news doesn't ever want to put that stuff on. They don't want to talk about it. They don't ever want to put it on. They're a bunch of fakers."
00:14:22 - 00:14:53 (31 sec),"And then you have Cory Booker, right? Cory Booker. Here's a guy who destroyed practically by himself the city of Newark, New Jersey. He was such a bad mayor. And see what he wrote himself about women. Check it out, folks. Check it out. Then he talks -- ""How dare you treat a woman like that."" Take a look at what this guy wrote."
00:14:53 - 00:15:35 (42 sec),"And I know about every one of them. I could go on and on. How about Feinstein? How about her? ""We need more time for the FBI. The FBI has to do a more thorough search. We had another woman just reported by a sleazebag lawyer named Avenatti."" Sleazebag. Sleazebag. We have -- well, it turned out even NBC, who's as bad as they get -- even NBC couldn't shield her with that interview."
00:15:35 - 00:16:11 (36 sec),"Did you see that interview? This woman had no clue what was going on. No clue. And yet she made the most horrible charges against a number one in his class at Yale, perfect human being, great father, great husband. This is a great person. And people are saying, ""Well, maybe it's true. And because of the fact that maybe it's true he should not become a United States Supreme Court justice."" How horrible is this?"
00:16:11 - 00:16:41 (30 sec),"How horrible is this? So this is an important time for our country. This is a time when your father, when your husband, when your brother, when your son could do great. ""Mom, I did great in school. I've worked so hard. Mom, I'm so pleased to tell you, I just got a fantastic job with IBM. I just got a fantastic job with General Motors."
00:16:41 - 00:17:13 (32 sec),"I just got -- I'm so proud."" ""Mom, a terrible thing just happened. A person who I've never met said that I did things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job, Mom. I don't know what to do. Mom, what do I do? What do I do, Mom? What do I do, Mom?"" It's a damn sad situation, OK? But we better start as a country getting smart and getting tough and not letting that stuff right back there, all those cameras, tell us how to live our lives."
00:17:13 - 00:17:50 (36 sec),"Because they are really dishonest people. Not all of them, but damn well most of them. That I can tell you. Fake news. So that's something to think about, right? That's something -- think of your son. Think of your husband. Think -- I've had many false accusations. I've had it all the -- I've had so many -- and when I say it didn't happen, nobody believes me. But it's me. It's my job description."
00:17:50 - 00:18:26 (36 sec),"Mr. Trump, it's OK, you can say whatever you want. They can say whatever they want about me. It's fine, because we have the worst libel laws anywhere in the world. They can say anything they want, and we can't sue them, because if you're famous, you can't sue. Figure that one out. But to take people that are just outstanding and have had great lives, and that life doesn't mean a thing."
00:18:26 - 00:18:50 (24 sec),"And do you notice with the judge, they don't talk about his last 35 years? They don't talk about what -- everybody knows him. He's a very well-known and most highly respected person until the last couple of weeks, because they're destroying him and they're destroying his reputation. And we can't let that happen."
00:18:50 - 00:19:08 (18 sec),"We can't. Can't let it happen. And I don't even know him, folks. I don't even know him. I met him for the first time a few weeks ago. I don't even know him. So it's not like, ""Oh, gee, I want to protect my friend."" I want to do what's right for this country. This is a very important time in our country... OK? Very important thing."
00:19:08 - 00:19:54 (46 sec),"Very important time in our country. The Democrat Party has become too extreme -- this is an example of it -- and too dangerous to be trusted with power. That is why you must vote Republican on Election Day, and you have to go out and vote. You know, I'm listening to commentators, and they say, ""If Trump were running, he's going to beat everybody."" They're saying that."
00:19:54 - 00:20:24 (31 sec),"You know, it's hard for them to admit that. And I certainly dream about all these people. Biden, the guy never had more than 1 percent in a poll when he was running for president, and then Obama took him off the trash heap, right? Biden -- I hear Biden wants to take me to the back of a barn. He would be in big trouble, I will tell you."
00:20:24 - 00:21:02 (38 sec),"Remember he said that? ""I'd like to take him."" You know, with Biden, you go like this -- whew -- and he goes down. [Laughter] Biden. And the other ones. But they say that, ""Donald Trump isn't running, so will the people go out and vote in three weeks?"" You got to go out and vote. And they say, ""But Donald Trump doesn't like Congress."" I really do. I like a lot of the people in Congress."
00:21:02 - 00:21:27 (25 sec),"Some I'm disappointed in, but for the most part -- and I have to tell you something: We have the right ideas. We're making our country great again. We're doing the right thing. We need more Republican votes. They say we have a majority. We barely have -- if somebody has a cold and stays home, we don't have a majority."
00:21:27 - 00:21:49 (22 sec),"That's how bad it is. Republicans have to go out and vote. And they say if I was on the ticket, everybody would go, it would be a landslide. Even the fakers back there, they say that. And I'm not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket. Because this is also a referendum about me and the disgusting gridlock that they'll put this country through."
00:21:49 - 00:22:20 (31 sec),"Think of it. We have the greatest economy in history. We have a military that will soon be the strongest we've ever had. Our country is doing so well. And then we have a Maxine Waters saying, ""We have to get rid of him. We have to get rid of him!"" Maxine Waters. And Nancy Pelosi. She's another beauty. Get out and vote!"
00:22:20 - 00:22:49 (29 sec),"I want you to vote. Pretend I'm on the ballot. And don't worry, we'll be on the ballot in two years, and we will do a landslide like you haven't -- like you wouldn't believe. A couple of the reporters I see back there, they said, ""Oh, Trump is running."" And I must say, one of them said, right after I announced, June 16th -- right after I announced, there was a Sunday morning show."
00:22:49 - 00:23:14 (24 sec),"And one of them said, ""You know he's going to win, don't you?"" And another one, who's back there now, who's looking very well, said, along with the host, ""Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, you're only kidding. He's just doing this for fun."" You think this is fun? Yeah, actually, it's sort of fun. I guess it is. For me, it's fun."
00:23:14 - 00:23:47 (33 sec),"For me, it's fun. You know why it's fun? Because we're achieving our goals better than anyone thought possible. That's why it's fun. If I wasn't, it wouldn't be fun. But this one particular reporter, she said, ""Ho, ho, ho, you're only kidding, right? Ha, ha, that's so funny."" And I'll never forget on election night, ""Donald Trump is your next president, folks."" And it's driving them crazy."
00:23:47 - 00:24:13 (27 sec),"So, we're thrilled to be here tonight, and I am having a lot of fun. But it is true: I'm having fun because nobody ever would have believed in a million years that we would have accomplished what we've accomplished. Nobody has accomplished more in two years. You take a look at the first two years of any -- nobody has even come close to accomplishing what we've accomplished."
00:24:13 - 00:24:29 (16 sec),"And I'm doing it for you, and we're doing it together, because this is a whole thing that has never happened in our country before. You know, it's interesting, when we first started, there were a lot of people who were showing up. And by the way, you think this is a big crowd in here? This place is packed, right?"
00:24:29 - 00:25:13 (44 sec),"Right? And if there was one empty seat, they would say, as the Washington Post did say -- the Washington Post came -- you saw that, right? -- came to an arena someplace four hours early and they hadn't started letting the people in yet. And he put a picture of an empty arena. There were tens of thousands of people outside waiting to come in. The Washington Post put a picture of an empty arena, and they put a caption to the effect, ""Mr. President, not a very good crowd, is it?"" And you know what happened?"
00:25:13 - 00:25:40 (27 sec),"And they had a picture up of an empty arena like I was a -- I didn't even land for four and a half hours later. And when I landed, that place was just like this. It was packed with thousands of people outside. Now, did they fire that reporter? No. Did they fire that reporter? No. Right? They -- isn't it incredible?"
00:25:40 - 00:26:17 (37 sec),"Isn't it sad? And look what happened to Roseanne. Did they fire Roseanne? Yes. No, but think of it. Puts a picture of an empty -- like it had 5 percent. People were just starting to trickle in. And said, ""Not a very good crowd, Mr. President."" There was no games. You know what happened that night? People that were sitting on stairwells, people that couldn't get a seat, people that were here only cause the fire marshals were so incredible, that shouldn't have even been allowed to come in, with thousands outside, they said, ""This is a fraud by the Washington Post."" I was there."
00:26:17 - 00:26:37 (19 sec),"There were no empty seats. We set a record that evening for crowd attendance. Because we don't need much of a stage. Basketball, they need a big -- you're filled up with people, like it is tonight. And we barely got an apology. And he admitted he was wrong. You know where he did it? On his little Twitter account."
00:26:37 - 00:27:03 (27 sec),"[Laughter] And that kind of dishonesty happens all the time. Happened at the inauguration. It happened at the inauguration. It happens all the time. These are very, very dishonest people. We are thrilled to be joined tonight by several great Republican leaders. And we're going to start with a friend of mine who is a very special man, very special."
00:27:03 - 00:27:36 (33 sec),"He's a great governor. Done a fantastic job. He called me. He built the African-American Museum. Called me. We went there. It was so beautiful. We had -- I was at the opening. We cut the ribbon! Governor Phil Bryant. Governor. Thank you, Phil. Thank you, Phil. Should we bring Phil up here? He's been so -- come on. Get up here, Phil."
00:27:36 - 00:28:02 (26 sec),"Come, come, come. Come on, Phil, get up here. What a great governor he's been. Look at this guy. Is he central casting or what? Is he -- look at this. He's central casting. But you know where he's really good? His heart and his brain. Great brain and great heart. Seriously."
00:28:02 - 00:28:53 (51 sec),"Thank you! Are we proud to have Donald J. Trump here in Mississippi? All right, I don't want to get started, but I can tell you what. This man has done more as president of the United States in two years than any president that I can ever remember or ever studied about. He is a remarkable man that is making America great again!

00:28:53 - 00:29:19 (26 sec),"Thank you very much, Phil. Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves. Tate? Tate? Where is Tate? Thanks, Tate. Doing a good job. And Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann. Delbert? Thank you. Thank you. And I want to thank your members of Congress that are here, because they've been warriors, they've been friends."
00:29:19 - 00:29:38 (19 sec),"They helped me with the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country... the biggest tax reform, the great regulation cuts, which could be even more important, frankly, than the tax cuts, if you want to know the truth, because it means jobs. But you have some great -- Congressman Trent Kelly. Trent, thank you."
00:29:38 - 00:30:14 (36 sec),"Gregg Harper. Thank you very much. And David Kustoff. Thank you, David. There's another warrior in the room. These are warriors. Look, the abuse they take, the abuse we all take, if you're not a warrior, you just go home, go to the corner, put your thumb in your mouth and say, ""Mommy, take me home."" You got to be a warrior."
00:30:14 - 00:30:54 (40 sec),"And a guy who is a wonderful friend of mine and has always been there for me, Senator Roger Wicker. Roger? What a great -- and Mrs. Wicker, thank you. What a great guy. And he's doing great. Get out and vote for him, anyway. He's winning by a lot, but get out there and vote. We love Roger. Finally, I want to introduce the person we are all here tonight to support, a true Mississippi patriot, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. Come on up. Cindy, come up."
00:30:54 - 00:31:41 (47 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. And I told him he would get a warm Mississippi welcome, and you did not disappoint. Yes! We are the Hospitality State, Mr. President. And I tell you, it is such an honor to work with this man. Is he not the best president we have ever had? This is wonderful."
00:31:41 - 00:32:13 (32 sec),"You know, early on, I was a supporter of then-candidate Donald J. Trump, and I was on his ag advisory committee. And now every time I walk onto the Senate floor, I want to help President Donald J. Trump. It is such an honor to work with a man that, I'll tell you, he loves the veterans, he loves the military, and he loves our law enforcement, as well."
00:32:13 - 00:32:40 (27 sec),"You know, this past week -- this past week in Brookhaven, Mississippi, my hometown, we had two officers shot down this past weekend. And I was able to tell him about that, James White and Zack Moak. And then the next day, we had a Mississippi Highway Patrol trooper, Josh Smith, shot down. And I'm just going to ask you to remember those people in your prayers as we continue on with this."
00:32:40 - 00:33:11 (31 sec),"We've had a tragic week in Mississippi with our law enforcement, but this man supports law enforcement 100 percent. I just want to thank our great governor, Phil Bryant, for making me your U.S. senator, to appoint me to that, an opportunity of three lifetimes. Other than being the mother of Anna Michael Smith and the husband of Mike Smith, it is the greatest honor of my life."
00:33:11 - 00:33:28 (17 sec),"And what a treat to serve with Senator Roger Wicker. When I tell you he's been a friend, he has been a friend to me on the Senate floor, no doubt. I tell you, you know, when I was sworn in as your U.S. senator, Vice President Mike Pence, he put this pin right here on me, and he said, ""Cindy, this pin will get you in any door in Washington, D.C."" But I want you to know, this isn't my pin."
00:33:28 - 00:33:40 (13 sec),"This is your pin. This is Mississippi's pin. We've got a lot of work to do in Washington, D.C. This man is leading the charge. We're going to get back on Air Force One, and we're going back to Washington, because you know what? We've got a Supreme Court justice to get confirmed! We got to. So I'm going to ask for your prayers, also, for the Kavanaugh family."
00:33:40 - 00:33:43 (3 sec),"And I'll tell you tonight, my true prayer is God will continue to bless these great state  of the United States!"
00:33:43 - 00:33:53 (9 sec),"Thank you, Cindy. [Audience Chants USA] Thank you, Cindy. Great. You know we had a great friend who was senator, and did a fantastic job, and it was just his time. He called me, it was his time. And you know who I'm talking about, wonderful man. And he said, ""You're going to have to appoint somebody."" And I went to Phil."
00:33:53 - 00:34:38 (45 sec),"I said, ""Phil, who's the best?"" And Phil had no doubt in his mind. That's who he recommended. And since then, Cindy has voted with me 100 percent of the time. She's always had my back. She's always had your back. And a vote for Cindy is a vote for me and make America great again. And a vote for Cindy's opponent, Mike Espy, is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary low-IQ person Maxine Waters."
00:34:38 - 00:35:19 (41 sec),"That's why Schumer's PAC is funding Mike Espy with a lot of money. A vote for Espy is a vote for the Democrat agenda to open borders and for radical socialism. When Espy was in Congress, he even sponsored legislation alongside Nancy Pelosi to provide taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens. Oh, that's great."
00:35:19 - 00:35:47 (28 sec),That's just what Mississippi wants. I don't think that works in Mississippi. Does that work? I don't think so. I don't think so. Your vote in this election will decide which party controls the United States Senate. It's very important. Very important. And that's a great woman. That's a great woman. Gotten to know her very well over the last number of months.
00:35:47 - 00:36:10 (24 sec),"If Democrats get control, they will raise your taxes, flood your streets with criminal aliens, weaken our military, outlaw private health insurance, and replace freedom with socialism. In a short period of time -- of course, I'll be doing lots of vetoes, just so don't worry too much -- they will turn America into Venezuela."
00:36:10 - 00:36:35 (25 sec),"How's that working out? And our country will never be Venezuela. We won't let that happen. If Democrats get 51 seats, the key Senate committees will be run by the far left Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. It's amazing that he wasn't more angry that the election got stolen from him, right? I don't get it. You know, he's always like complaining, complaining."
00:36:35 - 00:36:51 (15 sec),"He's jumping around. The hair's going crazy. The hair's going crazy. He's jumping like a lunatic. But he never complained about the fact that crooked Hillary cheated him out of the election. It's amazing. It's amazing. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up] You know, Bernie was on television recently. And he was screaming and ranting and raving."
00:36:51 - 00:37:14 (23 sec),"And I said to my wife, Melania, who's now in Africa representing us, first lady... I watched her get off that plane this morning in Africa. And so beautiful. And she was hugging and kissing children. It was beautiful to see. She's doing a great job as first lady, I will tell you. Really great. And you think that's an easy job?"
00:37:14 - 00:37:40 (26 sec),"That's not an easy job. That's a tough job. She's fantastic. But Bernie Sanders was ranting and raving and ""We're going to this"" and ""Trump and Trump and we got to stop"" -- what he's going to stop? Having a strong military? Having low taxes? Having borders? What's he going to stop? What am I doing? What's he going to stop?"
00:37:40 - 00:38:07 (27 sec),"Having less regulation? But he's going to stop Trump. He's going to stop Trump. He's going to stop us left and right. He's ranting and raving. And the commentator looks at him and goes, ""You know he's winning, don't you?"" And Bernie just looked at him like this. It was like -- but I said to my -- you got to hand it to him."
00:38:07 - 00:38:56 (49 sec),"You know, he's out there. He's doing his thing, whether you like it or not. He's out there doing his thing, and you've got to hand it to him. But a guy like Bernie would be in charge of the Budget Committee. Patrick Leahy -- oh, he's never had a drink in his life. [Laughter] Check it out. Look under ""Patrick Leahy/drink."" [Laughter] ""How dare you have a beer while you're in high school?"
00:38:56 - 00:39:27 (32 sec),"How dare."" ""Patrick Leahy-drink"" will be in charge of the Appropriations Committee. Bob Menendez -- you don't know about him -- will be in -- I'll leave him alone, because we can't cover too many of these characters, right? But I'm going to leave him alone -- will be in charge of Foreign Affairs. And the great Dianne Feinstein... will be in charge of the Judiciary Committee."
00:39:27 - 00:39:46 (19 sec),"No. Wasn't that great? Wasn't that great? Wasn't that something the other day? She was asked a simple question, ""Did you leak the document?"" -- wasn't that great? -- by John Cornyn. He goes, ""You leaked the document."" ""No. What? No."" ""Uh, remember?"" ""No. Oh, no, I didn't. No, I don't think I -- well, wait."
00:39:46 - 00:40:08 (22 sec),"Did we leak the document? No."" [Laughter] ""How about the aide?"" ""No, you idiot! No!"" [Laughter] ""No, we didn't leak the document. We didn't leak the document. No, we didn't."" That was the worst body language that I've ever seen. Oh, what a group. What a group. Holier than thou, aren't they? Holier than thou."
00:40:08 - 00:40:41 (33 sec),"You know the expression, right? What a group. Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats in Washington want to raid Medicare to pay for their socialist agenda. They're going to destroy it. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and paid for it, right? Right? And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing location."
00:40:41 - 00:41:37 (56 sec),"We're going to have to do that. Pre-existing conditions. We have to take care of pre-existing conditions, because it's just the way life is, folks. We have to do that. And the Democrats are talking about it and they can't do it, because they have no plan. So just put it down. And some Republicans say, ""Is that a Republican thing?"" Whether it is or not -- and to me it is, and it always will be -- pre-existing conditions will always be taken care of by us. Have to do it. We have to do it. We have to do it, and we want to do it. I want to do it. We're all going to do it. We're doing well."
00:41:37 - 00:42:11 (33 sec),"We'll take it from China. We'll take it from the European Union, who has taken advantage of us for years. We'll take it from Japan. We'll take it from our new, beautiful transaction, which is a fair transaction, and good for them, too, Mexico, Canada. We're going to have plenty of money coming in, folks, when we fix up these horrible trade deals."
00:42:11 - 00:42:37 (26 sec),"So we're going to take care of pre-existing conditions. People that have a problem are going to be helped by the Republican Party from -- from the time I got elected, really. You look at what we've done with Obamacare. It's a disaster. We had it beaten. But I'll say it a different way than I have been saying it. We didn't get one Democrat vote."
00:42:37 - 00:43:04 (27 sec),"We had it repealed and replaced. A little shocked took place early in the morning. But the fact is, we didn't get one Democrat vote. We would have saved a trillion dollars -- think of it -- our country would have saved $1 trillion had we gotten that extra vote. We didn't get one vote from one Democrat. But we've pretty much dismantled it. And here's a nice story."
00:43:04 - 00:43:37 (33 sec),"We've managed it well. And your premiums have gone up very little by -- remember, they were going up 156, 201, 187, 116 percent? Now we have it down. But we're getting rid of it entirely. We're going to have great health care. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE -- the brave, brave people of ICE."
00:43:37 - 00:44:14 (37 sec),"In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. That's what they want to do. Democrats also support strongly sanctuary cities of death. Sanctuary cities. Every day, sanctuary cities are unleashing vicious predators and bloodthirsty killers, like MS-13, into our communities. They go out and they hide out in sanctuary cities."
00:44:14 - 00:44:38 (24 sec),"Then they come into our cities and our towns. And then we send ICE in, and ICE has no problem. You know why? Because ICE is much tougher and much smarter than them. And ICE has done an incredible job. And they grab them by the neck and they throw them the hell out of our country or they throw them into jail."
00:44:38 - 00:45:04 (26 sec),"And you don't want that job. And you don't want that job. And you don't even want -- although maybe you could handle that job, right? But they do a fantastic job. And we have to cherish our law enforcement. And that goes for Border Patrol, that goes for ICE. We're setting records on the border on arrests."
00:45:04 - 00:45:30 (27 sec),"We don't want to do that. We're building the wall. It's going up. But getting money is brutal -- brutal. [Audience Chants Build the Wall] So we've started the wall. And we've done a lot in California and elsewhere -- San Diego. We're moving eastward, and we're covering a lot of territory. They gave us $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and another $1.6 billion."
00:45:30 - 00:46:17 (46 sec),"I want the whole thing, because we can do the whole damn wall, and we can do a great one in one year. But getting money from the Democrats is tough, because they know that's a big issue for us. And they know we need it. Most of them voted for it in 2006. I don't know if you know that. Most of them. But, of course, you have to have a wall."
00:46:17 - 00:47:15 (59 sec),"You have people pouring across. They're tackling people. And then, of course, they have catch and release. You catch somebody. ""Who is this person?"" ""It's a criminal."" ""Oh, that's OK. Catch, take his name and release the person."" And the person they think will come back to court. We have the dumbest immigration laws in the whole world."
00:47:15 - 00:47:45 (30 sec),"Watch what happens over the next couple of weeks, folks. Watch. Watch. And it's all because of the Democrats. Every Republican wants some change. But they stop you. The only thing they're good at -- they're lousy politicians. They're horrible in policy. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They're only good at one thing: resisting."
00:47:45 - 00:48:37 (51 sec),"They're good at sticking together. You rarely see them break up. They stick like glue. They stick. That's the only thing they're good at: delay and resist. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. If you want security, if you want a strong border, if you want to have a country that is a great, great, safe country, then you need to go out and you need to vote Republican."
00:48:37 - 00:49:08 (32 sec),"Have to do it. And everybody. This election in November is about safety and it's also about prosperity. They're going to take your wealth away from you. They're going to take your wealth away. All of that we've done with the jobs and the salaries and the wages that are rising for the first time in 21 years, they're going to take it away from you so fast."
00:49:08 - 00:49:44 (35 sec),"Since the election, we have created over 4 million new jobs. Unheard of. Unheard of! Unheard of! And lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. That's a big thing. We've added nearly 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. You remember when the previous administration said, ""Oh, you can't do manufacturing""? I said, ""Really, who's going to build things?"" They said, ""You won't add any."" They said you needed a magic wand, remember?"
00:49:44 - 00:50:10 (26 sec),"A magic wand. We don't have a magic wand. We've got good policy. We've got good leadership. We have a lot of good leaders in our party. And you've heard this many times over the last three weeks: African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded -- ever! Ever! Remember ""What do you have to lose?"" What do you have to lose, right?"
00:50:10 - 00:50:34 (24 sec),"What do you have to lose? I said. And people said, ""Oh, that's not nice."" But I said, ""Wait, they have the worst crime rate. They have the worst schools. They have the worst homeownership percentages. They have the"" -- I went through a list of 10 different things. And I looked up, and they've always voted for Democrats, the African-Americans, 95, more, percent."
00:50:34 - 00:51:10 (36 sec),"And I looked up and I said, ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" Remember? And now... Not only do they have the lowest unemployment rate in history, but African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate also ever recorded. It's a great thing, right? So -- and we've just started. We've just started. Remember, same true for Hispanic Americans, the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded."
00:51:10 - 00:51:54 (43 sec),"Same for Asian Americans, lowest unemployment rate ever recorded. Women, lowest unemployment rate in 65 years. After years and years of working so hard, we finally put ourselves in a position where we can do things. And we can really do them. But we could do them an awfully lot better if we had more -- a real majority, not a majority of one, not a majority of literally if somebody's sick, it's like we have to postpone votes."
00:51:54 - 00:52:14 (20 sec),"We need a real majority, and we're going to do everything that you've been looking for for a long time. You know, with that being said, we've done so much. We've done so much. We've just finalized the tremendous new trade agreement with South Korea, where it was a disaster. That was a Hillary Clinton catastrophe."
00:52:14 - 00:52:39 (25 sec),"Remember she said, ""We are going to create 250,000 new jobs""? And she was right, for South Korea. It was good. [Laughter] And we've just totally renegotiated it. We've made it good. And we've opened up new negotiations with Japan, who would not negotiate with the previous administration. You know why? Because they said, ""No, we're happy."
00:52:39 - 00:53:07 (28 sec),"Why should we negotiate? We're not going to negotiate."" Well, we said, ""We want to negotiate."" And with the European Union, ""We want to negotiate."" And they said... [Audience member calls out 'We Love You'] I love you, too. You're not my type, but I love you. That was a strong guy, by the way, in case... [Laughter] Because if that was a woman, I'm in big trouble."
00:53:07 - 00:53:40 (33 sec),"And you know what? I go, I hope you're a guy. Are you? So -- so the European Union and Japan, I said, ""Listen, we lost $151 billion, with a B, with you."" We lost $151 billion. Jean-Claude -- he's the head of the European Union -- I said, ""Jean-Claude"" -- he's tough and smart, smart, really tough. I don't think he likes our country too much, but I've told him that many times."
00:53:40 - 00:54:00 (20 sec),"Well, they were formed -- right? -- they were formed in order to take advantage of us. ""So, Jean-Claude, for years, the Obama administration wanted to negotiate and you said, 'No, we're not going to negotiate.' I'm telling you, I want to negotiate."" We lost $151 billion with the European Union. Many of us come from the European Union."
00:54:00 - 00:54:20 (20 sec),"I do. I do. Many of the people in the room, sounds so nice, European Union. And they're just killing us. So I said, ""We have to negotiate."" ""Oh, yes, yes."" Two weeks go by, we don't get a call. I call him up again, I say, ""Jean-Claude! We got to negotiate."" ""Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes."" Beautiful accent."
00:54:20 - 00:54:48 (28 sec),"I wish I had his accent. [Laughter] I would have been president 15 years ago if I had his accent. And I said, ""Jean-Claude, please, we got to negotiate! I can't take this, $151 billion we lose. You have barriers against our farmers. We can't sell farm products. You have barriers against our cars, and yet you give us millions of Mercedes and BMW and all these cars, they pour into our country."
00:54:48 - 00:55:11 (22 sec),"You have barriers and you charge us big tariffs for products. And you make it impossible for us to give you -- but you sell us so much. Jean-Claude, we have to negotiate."" And he said, ""Oh, yes, yes, yes."" Two weeks go by. No negotiation. I say, ""Jean-Claude, you don't have to negotiate anymore, Jean-Claude."
00:55:11 - 00:55:38 (27 sec),"I am going to put a 25 percent tariff on Mercedes Benz, BMW, and every car you send in to the United States."" ""We're putting a 25 percent tariff or tax on every car, millions and millions of cars, that you send in to the United States."" He said, ""No, no, no, please! I will be there tomorrow morning."" This was an evening."
00:55:38 - 00:56:02 (24 sec),"I get to my office. He's there. [Laughter] I said, ""Where did you come from, New York?"" ""No, no, no, I came from Europe."" I said, ""Let me know the name of that plane. That is the fastest plane."" [Laughter] And now they're dying to make a deal. You saw what's been going on with these deals. China! They're draining us. They're taking our money."
00:56:02 - 00:56:37 (35 sec),"They're rebuilding themselves. They're building a jet a day. They're building many, many bridges the size and bigger than, like, the George Washington Bridge. What are we doing? We're helping them. We've rebuilt China. They've taken so much money. I like President Xi, the head of China, but I said, ""We can't do this anymore."" So now we put $50 billion of tariffs on. And they said... They said, ""No, no, no, no, you cannot do that."
00:56:37 - 00:57:00 (23 sec),"If you go $50 billion, we'll go $50 billion."" I said, ""Wait a minute, we're already $500 billion behind. So if I go $50 billion, you go $50 billion, that means we're at the same place we started from. That's not what this is all about. We have to bring some balance. We can't do this."" So they said, ""No."" So it's $50 billion at 10 percent."
00:57:00 - 00:57:30 (30 sec),"I increased it to 25 percent, and I put $200 billion on top of the $50 billion. So now we have $250 billion at 25 percent. By the way, billions and billions of dollars. The fake news people back there, all those people with all those red lights... they don't want to talk about it. But all of that money, billions of dollars will be flowing in to our treasury."
00:57:30 - 00:58:00 (30 sec),"Many of the products that we're buying over there will be made in the United States because they don't want to pay the tax and there's no tariffs. And I said, ""If you attack our farmers, who I love"" -- they're special. See, he's got the green hat on? ""Make Our Farmers Great Again."" Right? ""Make Our Farmers Great Again."" But they said, ""You know what?"
00:58:00 - 00:58:26 (26 sec),"The farmers love Trump. We'll attack the farmers by not buying"" -- well, guess what? They're starting to buy again, aren't they? But I said, ""If you do that, we're going to put an additional $267 billion onto your numbers. So we're going to have $500 billion and probably it'll end up $562 billion when you add it all up, including the little stars all over the place."" And you know what?"
00:58:26 - 00:58:48 (22 sec),"They want to talk. They want to make a deal. Then China's been hurt very badly over the last number of months. Their markets are down 30 percent. And our markets are up 55 percent since I became president. And I hope we can make a deal with China, but honestly, who knows? But we're very happy where we are."
00:58:48 - 00:59:08 (19 sec),"Very, very happy. And I want to thank the farmers, because, you know, I watch the farmers. And they say -- and don't forget, the farmers have been going down like this for 20 years; long before I got here. We're going to bring those green caps. You're going to be so proud of me, OK? You're going to be so proud."
00:59:08 - 00:59:30 (23 sec),"They want to talk. And at some point, they're talking. But I told them just recently, ""You're not ready to talk yet. You're not ready."" In all fairness, they've been making so much money. It's hard for them to say -- they're making $500 billion a year because we had -- ha, let's be nice -- we had presidents that it wasn't their thing."
00:59:30 - 00:59:51 (21 sec),"But it is my thing. Do you know how wealthy our country would be if they didn't have these really stupid deals all over the place, so many of them? And how about our military deals, where we protect rich nations and we don't get reimbursed? How about that stuff? That's changing, too, folks. We protect Saudi Arabia."
00:59:51 - 01:00:20 (29 sec),"Would you say they're rich? And I love the king, King Salman. But I said, ""King, we're protecting you. You might not be there for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military."" ""You have to pay."" And Japan is going to also contribute. Japan -- we protect Japan. They pay us a small percentage. We protect South Korea."
01:00:20 - 01:00:44 (24 sec),"They pay us -- and by the way, we're doing great on North Korea, but South Korea. They got to reimburse us. They've got to reimburse us. Republicans passed and I signed the biggest package of tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. We have cut a record number of regulations. Now, we got no Democrat support for any of this."
01:00:44 - 01:01:24 (39 sec),"This is what's driving our economy, those two things. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs. Watch what's going to happen to drug prices. And to help critically ill patients get access to life-saving treatments, we passed what's called Right to Try. A person's terminally ill, they're going to die, and before me, if we had a drug that was really looking good or promising, we wouldn't give them, because we didn't want to hurt the person."
01:01:24 - 01:01:46 (22 sec),"They're going to die. And it is actually much more complicated than that. They've been trying to pass this for 45 years. Well, two months ago, I signed Right to Try. We have the greatest drugs in the world, the greatest drugmakers in the world. I would watch wealthy people travel all over the world trying to find a cure."
01:01:46 - 01:02:09 (24 sec),"And poor people just went home. They had no hope. Now they have the right to try. If we have a drug that looks good but it's two years or three years or four years out -- and, by the way, we brought that number from 15 years, we think it's going to be down to four and in some cases three. Way down. Scott is doing a great job."
01:02:09 - 01:02:33 (24 sec),"Scott, get that number down, Scott. And now we have that -- I love that. Right to Try, such a great name. Right to Try. You have hope. We also passed veterans' choice. Forty-four years they tried to do it. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor if they've got to wait on line for weeks and weeks and weeks."
01:02:33 - 01:03:05 (32 sec),"Forty-four years! And we passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act. That's people that work in the V.A. that treat our veterans badly, and we couldn't do a thing about it, and now we can fire them so fast... I just signed legislation -- and you think that was easy, getting that through the unions and civil service?"
01:03:05 - 01:03:47 (42 sec),"That was a 48-year job. And your two senators helped me a lot, I will tell you. They helped me a lot. Thank you, Cindy. Thank you, Roger. And your congressmen, by the way, helped me a lot -- in particular your congressman. I just signed legislation to completely rebuild our military, securing $700 billion, and then the following year $716 billion to purchase the finest planes and ships and tanks and missiles and submarines on the face of the Earth, all made in America, made in the USA."
01:03:47 - 01:04:16 (29 sec),"And we have given our troops their largest pay raise in more than a decade. Isn't that nice? About time. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working very hard to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces. It's called the Space Force. So you have the Air Force, you have the Space Force. Separate."
01:04:16 - 01:04:47 (30 sec),"The Space Force. And that's what it's all about, folks. You look at what's happening. I'm not just talking rockets to the moon and to Mars. I'm talking about defense. I'm talking about -- that's where it is. It's in space. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, right? Space Force! I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal."
01:04:47 - 01:05:06 (20 sec),"And Iran is a much different country. They're trying to put out all the riots they have all over that country. You know, when I became a president, I looked there -- before I became -- I said, ""How are you stopping Iran?"" Nobody was able to tell me. And I did this and they have shattered, man. They have shattered."
01:05:06 - 01:05:36 (30 sec),"I got rid of that deal. How about we gave them $150 billion for nothing? We gave them $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. And we've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we won't even mention how well we're doing with North Korea. But when I came in there, too, they were going to go to war with North Korea."
01:05:36 - 01:05:58 (22 sec),"President Obama said it was his biggest problem. We sat before I took office. ""What's your biggest problem?"" ""Biggest problem is North Korea. We were going to go with North Korea."" We're doing very well now with North Korea. You don't feel that way anymore, right? You don't feel that way anymore. And the fake news comes out and says, ""He's giving so much."" I haven't given anything."
01:05:58 - 01:06:28 (30 sec),"We got our hostages back, right? We've got a lot and we're getting the remains of our great fallen heroes back. There's been no rockets launched. There's been no missiles launched. There's been no nuclear tests. And we have a good relationship. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going over to North Korea next week."
01:06:28 - 01:06:48 (20 sec),"And we're working on a second summit. And it just feels good. Now, who knows, folks? Who knows? I can just tell you, when we came in, before I came in, and at the beginning when the rhetoric was tough, right, that rhetoric was tough, these people were saying, ""Oh, he's going to get us into a war."" Well, guess what?"
01:06:48 - 01:07:18 (30 sec),"That worked out. That rhetoric was tough. And let's see what happens. But we're doing very well. We're doing very well. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Mississippi."
01:07:18 - 01:08:15 (57 sec),"We are standing proudly. We are standing up for your national anthem. Right? [Audience Chants USA] A lot of spirit. A lot of spirit. One of them said the other day, ""You know, President Trump can't be beaten in 2020."" That's driving them crazy. Oh! Who the hell's going to beat us? Look, who's going to beat us? If another president came in, and they said, ""We're coming to Mississippi, and we're going to make a speech,"" you know how many people would show up? Really, 300, 400. You'd have a medium-sized meeting room at a hotel."
01:08:15 - 01:09:03 (47 sec),"Look at this place. Look at this place. Look at this place! We're lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get out and vote Republican, vote for Cindy Hyde-Smith and vote for Roger Wicker."
01:09:03 - 01:09:40 (37 sec),"Got to do it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation and more products made right here in the USA. It's a vote to reduce crime, respect law enforcement and restore the rule of law. It's a vote for strong borders, safe communities and thriving families, which you are. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, destruction, chaos, and to come together as neighbors, as citizens and as Americans."
01:09:40 - 01:10:07 (27 sec),"To everyone in this room tonight, to every citizen watching all across our land, this is your time to choose. Very important time when you look at what's happening to Judge Kavanaugh. This is a very important time. It's time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past or whether we continue forward into the unlimited promise of our future."
01:10:07 - 01:10:41 (34 sec),"It's not up to the media or the pundits to decide your fate. It's up to you. The future is in your hands, as it was in 2016. That was a beautiful time. There has never been an election like this in our country's history. You have the power -- just as you did in 2016 -- with your vote to same America from socialism and to save America from decay."
01:10:41 - 01:11:16 (35 sec),"It's up to you on November 6th to choose a future of patriotism, prosperity and pride. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to everyday Americans. We stand on the shoulder of the giants of American history, the greatest, the toughest, the most courageous men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth."
01:11:16 - 01:12:09 (53 sec),"Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, won a revolution, and fought to victory in two world wars. Think of it. Think of it. Right? Think of it. American patriots defeated fascism, triumphed over communism, and delivered millions and millions and millions of people into freedom. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to tear down their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage, right?"
01:12:09 - 01:12:37 (28 sec),"Just like the pioneers and patriots who came before us, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory."
01:12:37 - 01:13:35 (58 sec),"Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Mississippi. Get out and vote. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:02:00 (120 sec),"Hello, Kansas, thank you very much. Hello, Kansas. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be here with all of my friends on this truly historic night. This is a historic night. I stand before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our nation, our people, and our beloved constitution. Just a few hours ago the U.S. Senate confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court, and I proudly signed the judge's commission aboard Air Force One just before landing."
00:02:00 - 00:02:33 (33 sec),"And this Monday night, at 7:00 pm in the East Room of the White House, We will perform the swearing in ceremony for soon-to-be Justice Kavanaugh, a great man. And he will sit proudly alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch, who's doing a great job to uphold your sacred rights and to defend your God-given freedom."
00:02:33 - 00:03:15 (42 sec),"And I want to thank our incredible Republican senators for refusing to back down in the face of the Democrats, shameless campaign of political and personal destruction. Since the moment Brett Kavanaugh was senate, and you remember this, we made an announcement and since right from the moment we announced, radical Democrats launched a disgraceful campaign to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy, right from the beginning."
00:03:15 - 00:03:39 (24 sec),"Brett Kavanaugh is a man of great character and intellect. He's a totally brilliant scholar, who has devoted his life to the law, he is a loving husband, a devoted father, and a faithful public servant, and he always has been. What he and his wonderful family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable, unthinkable."
00:03:39 - 00:04:11 (32 sec),"In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob, you saw that today with the screaming and the shouting, not from the 200 people or less that were --  You know what? Those people, they couldn't fit in the front row, look what we have here today. They threw away and threw aside every notion of fairness, of justice, of decency and of due process."
00:04:11 - 00:04:45 (34 sec),"Nobody's seen anything like it. What each of you will have a chance in just four weeks to render your verdict on the Democrats conduct at the ballot box. Got to vote, got to vote.  On November 6th, you will have the chance to stop the radical Democrats, and that's what they've become, by electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate. We will increase our majorities. We need more Republicans, we need more Republicans."
00:04:45 - 00:05:30 (45 sec),"Over the past few weeks, every American has now seen the profound stakes in the upcoming election. You now see it. We have been energized, we have been energized. if Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, Just imagine the devastation they would cause if they ever obtained the power they so desperately want, and Greg. You'll going to have other Supreme Court justices places to be filled it could be three, it could even be four, it could be a lot."
00:05:30 - 00:06:06 (36 sec),"And if you allow the wrong people to get into office, things could change, they could change, and they could change fast. And we're not going to let that happen, we can't let that happen. It could go very quickly, it can change very fast, we can't let that happen. You don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry leftwing mob, and that's what they've become. The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern."
00:06:06 - 00:06:33 (27 sec),"Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob. We're doing a hell of a job of doing it, we're draining the swamp and we want to defeat the Democrats conducively. So under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, America is winning because we are finally putting America first, we are putting America first."
00:06:33 - 00:07:08 (35 sec),"Yesterday it was announced that unemployment has fallen to 3.7%, the lowest  unemployment rate in 50 years, lowest in 50 years. We've created nearly 600,000 jobs in the last three months alone, think of that, 600,000, and if I ever said that, when I was campaigning, the fake news media would go, I'd say, ""Impossible."" They are fake."
00:07:08 - 00:08:17 (69 sec),"Manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high. Confidence, very important, all-time high. And we have the best economy in the history of our country, the best.We're taking care of our veterans, protecting our great seniors, and rebuilding America's military might like it hasn't been built before. But if Democrats take control, they will try to plunge our country into gridlock poverty and chaos, and that's what's going to happen, it can change."
00:08:17 - 00:08:53 (35 sec),"The Democrats want to significantly raise your taxes. Essentially, they want to impose socialism, Venezuela, dismantle law enforcement and eliminate our borders. They want to have nice, open borders, no way. Bill. The Democrats have become the party of crime, they have become the party of crime, think of it. Republicans are the party of law and order, and justice."
00:08:53 - 00:09:18 (25 sec),"And we really have become, even more so, than ever before the party of opportunity and wealth, and that's what's happening with creating wealth for everybody. Whether it's small businesses big businesses or people wanting great jobs, that's what's happening. And you know wages? Right now, for the first time in 19 years, wages are going up for people, and jobs. you can choose the job you want for the first time. Many years."
00:09:18 - 00:09:45 (28 sec),"So we are thrilled to be joined by a number of your state's terrific Republican leaders. And  I have to tell you that I wasn't supposed to be here because, you know, this is such a big day. This is such a big day. I was supposed to call you, they said, ""Do you mind calling Kris Kobach and Steve Watkins? Do you mind telling them?"
00:09:45 - 00:10:19 (34 sec),"That because of the fact that we are, today, getting this great, great, talented, wonderful Supreme Court judge. They said, ""Could you call the people of Kansas and tell them we won't be able to make it tonight.?"" I said, ""I don't have the courage to do that. I don't have the courage"" I said, ""I don't have the courage."" They call me, they said, ""Sir, we're signing the next United States Supreme Court justice."""
00:10:19 - 00:10:51 (32 sec),"They always say, you've heard it. The biggest thing a president can do, they've always said, is Supreme Court justice the biggest, and some of it none. We've had two in less than two years, I guess, you know, some of [Inaudible] some presidents have it. But it's the biggest thing you can do so they said, ""Sir, do you mind canceling Kansas tonight? We're going to have -- "" I said, ""No way I'm canceling Kansas. No way. No way."""
00:10:51 - 00:11:16 (25 sec),"I had that phone working, I had that phone working on that plane, I had that signature going on the plane, and here we are. And by the way, you think this crowd inside is big, you could see the crowd that's outside. We just put up big movie screens but I think this is better, right? This is better. I want to thank Congressman Roger Marshall, has been a great friend."
00:11:16 - 00:11:34 (18 sec),"Roger has been a great friend, and a great friend also, Ron Estes, great person. He helped us so much with the tax cuts, with regulation cuts, with so many things that we've passed that nobody thought would be possible, would be possible. So thank you both very much. Where are they? Where are they? Thank you very much, fellas, thank you. Fantastic"
00:11:34 - 00:12:18 (44 sec),"And also, I want to thank somebody who's done a fantastic job, GOP Chair Kelly Arnold. Kelly? Great job. You know why a great job? Because we won this state by a lot, right?  And after what I just did for you with the new deal with Mexico and Canada, I think we should double it up, I think we should double it up. USMCA, USMCA. I refused to call it NAFTA because NAFTA was such a horrible deal."
00:12:18 - 00:12:57 (39 sec),"You didn't even realize it, that was so --  50,000 plants and factories emptied out, millions and millions of jobs lost, so we negotiated a new deal, and I said,  ""There's no way of calling it NAFTA 2, USMCA. And we opened up -- we opened up agriculture, we opened up dairy, we opened up a lot of things and everybody's really happy."
00:12:57 - 00:13:32 (35 sec),"I don't know how they're doing in the other places but they're really happy. So congratulations. Congratulations. And we also signed a great new deal with South Korea and the farmers are going to be benefiting there too. And we're working -- Right now they  want to make a deal. I said,  ""You're not ready to make a deal yet."" We're working on a deal with China."
00:13:32 - 00:14:03 (31 sec),"We'll see. Well see. Well see. Look, they've been hitting us hard for a long time. We've never had a president that did anything about it. $500 billion a year, that's a big one. They take out. So right now we're doing extremely well with China, and let's see what happens. Maybe we'll do it and if we don't we're going to be in even better position, you understand that. So we'll see."
00:14:03 - 00:14:42 (40 sec),"I also want to thank a man of incredible integrity and class, your governor, Jeff Collier. Jeff? Jeff? Where's Jeff? Jeff is a great guy who's doing a really incredible job and thank you, Jeff. But I didn't know Jeff. I told Jeff, I said, ""Nothing personal, I just didn't know you because when I backed Chris and you have one hell of a governor."" And I think we have to talk about bringing him down to Washington or something. We talked about it."
00:14:42 - 00:15:06 (24 sec),"Great governor, great man. We're also joined by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt. Thank you. And president of the Kansas State Senate Susan Wagle. Susan. Thank you, Susan. I'm so proud that our Campaign Manager Brad Parscale, you know Brad, Brad Parscale. Where's Brad? Guy's like 7 feet tall, so you can't miss him. Thank you, Brad."
00:15:06 - 00:15:38 (32 sec),"Our chief, our chief you know him, our Chief Operating Officer Mike Glassner. You know Michael? He's fantastic right from the beginning. Thank you, Michael. They all come from Kansas. They all come from Kansas. I guess that's how we win, you get from Kansas you wouldn't lose them. Along with our amazing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He is doing a great job."
00:15:38 - 00:16:06 (28 sec),"He's headed over to North Korea. This guy travels, boy you got to do that to be a good one. You know, if you're home a lot you're not doing much of a good job. We're doing a great job with North Korea we're doing a great job with everybody. Mike Pompeo from Kansas. Great man. And also here with us tonight is your next lieutenant governor, Wink Hartman. Thank you, Wink. Thank you, Wink."
00:16:06 - 00:16:30 (25 sec),"So a man that's been with me from the beginning, he's tough, he's strong and I hated that he ran because I would have loved to have brought him into my administration, effectively loses, I'll bring him into my administration in two seconds. I hope he loses because I want him so badly. But don't do that."
00:16:30 - 00:17:45 (74 sec),"Don't you. Don't do that. I was angry when he did it. I said, ""Don't do it."" ""Sir, I want to be the governor of Kansas. I love my people."" I said, ""Don't do it. Don't do it."" I was very unhappy. I was very, very unhappy. I said, ""Don't do it."" Then he went out and he's been winning and he's been doing an incredible job. But he does, he loves this state. He loves the state so much and I want to introduce the next governor of Kansas, Kris Kobach."
00:17:45 - 00:18:33 (48 sec),"Well let me just say on behalf of all of Kansas, President Trump, welcome to Trump country. It is such an honor and a blessing to have President Trump here in the city where I grew up to support my campaign in the state that we all love. And I want to give President Trump credit for something really important, it's something he and I have worked together on. We've worked for a number of things but the most important is stopping illegal immigration.  I'm so glad that America has a president who gets it and knows that illegal means illegal."
00:18:33 - 00:18:57 (24 sec),"I want to tell you a quick short story about illegal immigration. I began working on this issue when I was an adviser to John Ashcroft at the time of 9/11. I was there during 9/11, and we all remember how the world changed. But let me tell you something that you may not know. All 19 hijackers came into this country legally on temporary visas."
00:18:57 - 00:19:25 (28 sec),"Five of them became illegal mostly by overstaying their visas. Four of those five were stopped by state and local law enforcement for speeding violations. They were illegally in the country at the time but the cops didn't know it, and so they could -- they didn't make an arrest even though they could have if they'd had that information at their fingertips."
00:19:25 - 00:20:24 (59 sec),Now get this. Three of those for pi -- the three of those for illegal aliens that they could have arrested were pilots. So if they had made those arrests they could have stopped 9/11 from happening. Those numbers have shaped my career. The gravity of that has never left me and I will not and I know President Trump will not allow our immigration system to be used again as a weapon to harm the American people.
00:20:24 - 00:20:42 (18 sec),"Stopping illegal aliens is not just about jobs, it's not just about crime. i's about our nation's security, and that comes first. And illegal immigration is an issue in this campaign for governor. Did you know that my opponent Laura Kelly voted to continue allowing sanctuary cities in Kansas? She did. She did. Look it up. It's in the roll call vote."
00:20:42 - 00:21:33 (51 sec),"When I am governor, God willing, sanctuary cities will end in this state. Laura Kelly also voted to allow illegal aliens to continue getting welfare benefits. So while we're struggling to pay our electricity bill to pay higher taxes, we're meanwhile giving taxpayer dollars to illegal aliens. Is that fair? It's time to stop illegal aliens from getting taxpayer dollars."
00:21:33 - 00:21:53 (20 sec),"It's time to put Kansans first, not illegal aliens. There's another big issue. [Crowd cheering] There's another big issue that President Trump and I have both been concerned about. Voter fraud. Because of the law that I drafted in the Kansas legislature passed, Kansas now has the most secure election laws in America. Photo ID creates trust in our elections."
00:21:53 - 00:22:23 (30 sec),"If you need a photo ID to cash a check or to buy the kind of Sudafed that works, you probably going to need one to go cast a vote in an election. And proof of citizenship too, proof of citizenship. Every time an alien votes, every time an alien votes, it cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen. The Democrats and their socialist friends, they claim they care about voter cancellation or voter suppression, but they don't care about us citizens votes being canceled out."
00:22:23 - 00:22:59 (36 sec),"It's time for other states to require proof of citizenship too, just like Kansas. One more, one more topic. Taxes. Thanks to President Trump, our federal tax burden is much lower. But in Kansas, our state taxes are the highest in the region. It's time to cut our state taxes here in Kansas. When I am governor, the first bill that I want to sign is one that passes along the Trump tax windfall to the people of Kansas."
00:22:59 - 00:23:25 (26 sec),"$137 million. And on top of that, you've got thousands of Kansans being taxed out of their own home because of property tax appraisal increases, they can't afford to live in the home they wanted to retire in. When I am governor we will put a 2$ cap on property tax appraisal increases."
00:23:25 - 00:24:45 (79 sec),"To put it simply, I want to do for Kansas what President Trump has done for America. [Crowd cheering] We've got a big election, a big election ahead of us on November 6th. It's a point of choice, not only for America but a big decision for Kansas. Tonight, President Trump is here calling on us to get out there and vote, calling on us to stand up, the time is now. To stand up for the proven principles and constitutional rights that have made this country great and made this country strong."
00:24:45 - 00:25:08 (23 sec),"And the time is now, that we must reject the political correctness that the progressives and the left are constantly putting on us. And stand up, and stand up for the time-tested values of hard work, faith in God and the United States Constitution. Thank you, President Trump, for making America great again. And now we're going to make Kansas great again."
00:25:08 - 00:25:35 (27 sec),"Thank you. What a job he did for me, I'll tell you, what a job he did. He's going to be a great governor. He will do the job for you. He is going to be a great, great governor. He is a tireless champion for border security. He'll fight for you every single day. He doesn't stop. He'll protect your family, he'll protect your children."
00:25:35 - 00:26:20 (45 sec),"Now his far-left opponent is Laura Kelly. Voted to raise your taxes. And she supports giving public benefits to the illegal aliens [Inaudible. And Laura Kelly earned an F. And never even heard of an F. An F-rating from the NRA. An F. I assume that means that she's not too big on the second amendment, is that way? How would that be? Everybody get out and vote for my friend Kris Kobach on Election Day, please."
00:26:20 - 00:26:34 (14 sec),"Finally, I want to introduce another terrific Republican candidate, your next congressman. Get out and vote. I need him in Washington. Steve Watkins. Steve is a great veteran. He's a patriot, and a proud West Point graduate, that means he's very smart. Steve, come on up."
00:26:34 - 00:27:18 (44 sec),"Hey. Kansans can do anything. I'm proof of that. I. Grew up a couple of miles away. And here I am standing next to the leader of the free world. And not just any leader, a truly great one. You see, when I left -- when I left Kansas I went among other things I spent eight years in war zones, eight years with my boots in the sand of Iraq and Afghanistan."
00:27:18 - 00:27:50 (32 sec),"Eight years. And in all that time -- all that time I really just learned a couple of things, I know for sure that I have seen the devil, but I have also seen fighters, Donald Trump is a fighter. He fights. He fights for America first, he fights to keep our borders secure, he fights for jobs he fights to those [Inaudible] approaching retirement."
00:27:50 - 00:28:53 (63 sec),"He is a fighter and we are so honored to have him here in Kansas. He moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Yes. He likes -- he likes appointing pro-constitution judges to the bench. And he is tough on China, Iran, and North Korea. Do other things, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Now Kansas, Kansas, you know, might be a little partial, but just think how much more he could have accomplished if he were a Kansan."
00:28:53 - 00:29:07 (14 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for all that you do, for Kansas, and for America ,and for this world. We're so glad you're here. Thank you, sir."
00:29:07 - 00:29:30 (23 sec),"Good man. Good man. And a vote for Steve is a vote for me and our agenda to make America great again. You know that agenda. A lot of hats. A vote for Steve's opponent, his name is Paul Davis. He's not good, he's not good, you know that, is a vote for a radical agenda of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the legendary Maxine Waters."
00:29:30 - 00:30:18 (48 sec),"Here in Kansas, his opponent Paul Davis voted time after time to raise your taxes and fees. And he voted to give public benefits to illegal aliens at work. If you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker of the house, Nancy, let Nancy Pelosi. Woah, you better get out and vote for Steve Watkins, please. A majority of House Democrats have already sponsored a socialist takeover of healthcare."
00:30:18 - 00:31:38 (80 sec),The Democrats' plan would eviscerate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for 20 million seniors. We want to protect Medicare we will as Republicans protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it. And we will always protract Americans with pre-existing conditions. We will take care of our great Americans with pre- existing conditions.
00:31:38 - 00:32:40 (63 sec),"Today's Democrats have embraced radical socialism and open borders. If you don't have borders, you don't have a country, folks, you don't have a country. Every single Democrat. In the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders and it's a bill, it's called The Open Borders Bill. What's going on? And it's written by -- Guess who?"
00:32:40 - 00:33:23 (42 sec),"Dianne Feinstein. Remember the leaking, right? The leakin' Dianne Feinstein. ""Did you leak? Did you leak, Dianne? Dianne, did you... "" ""No, no, no, I don't. No.No. I don't think. Wait. Did we leak? No, he said no, no we didn't leak."" Oh. Was that the worst body language you've ever seen? Was that the worst? ""No, I didn't leak. I didn't leak."" No she didn't leak. That's what you're dealing with."
00:33:23 - 00:34:12 (50 sec),"If the Democrats bill ever becomes law, a tidal wave of drugs and crime would pour into our nation like never ever before. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities that release violent predators and bloodthirsty killers like MS-13 into our communities. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens"
00:34:12 - 00:34:57 (45 sec),"And Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE, border patrol, and law enforcement. They wanted the fund ICE. Can you believe it? You know how tough  ICE is? When MS-13 sees ICE coming, they say, ""Let's get out of here."" But you know what? They can't, because they get caught, they get thrown, and they get thrown the hell out of the country. They can't."
00:34:57 - 00:35:37 (39 sec),"They don't like that. The Democrats want to get rid of ICE. So these are great Americans. By the way, ICE, great Americans. They happen to be tough people. I think we need some tough people, they're tough. MS-13 doesn't like ICE and that's why I like ICE. But they really are, they're great Americans, they love our country and they're not treated properly,  they're not treated properly."
00:35:37 - 00:36:00 (24 sec),"I've seen it in Long Island. They go into a community. I've grew up in that vicinity, I know every community out there. And they go into these communities and these are rough,  rough people, MS13, how they even come in and we stop them at the border but there's so many here from before us, from before us, and our laws are so bad and we're getting them changing stuff."
00:36:00 - 00:36:52 (52 sec),"That's why we need more Republicans. But they come in and -- Long Island, we send ICE and they get in there and they get them out, and it's like we're liberating a town. In this day and age it's like in a war, where you know, you're a foreign invader -- a foreign invader, finally, is being taken out. They're liberating a country or liberating a city or town."
00:36:52 - 00:37:42 (50 sec),"These people are liberating these towns, and you know the story, and you've heard it, it's all over. They cut people up because they don't want to use bullets, it's too fast and it's not painful enough. And then when I said. ""Animals!"" Nancy Pelosi said, ""How dare you speak that way about a human being. How dare you.""  Right? This woman just said it to me. She screamed out of the word animal, so how dare you call them."
00:37:42 - 00:38:10 (29 sec),"They're human beings and not -- these are animals folks. These are animals. And we need law enforcement, and we need ICE and we need border patrol. These are great people. And if your community has a problem, don't worry about it just give us a call, we'll take care of it. Democrats are also fighting to give welfare and free healthcare to illegal aliens paid for by you, the American taxpayer. Thank you very much."
00:38:10 - 00:38:33 (22 sec),"Republicans believe that the public benefits must be protected for the truly, needy Americans. Americans that need help, not illegal aliens. If you want safe. If you want a border. If you want America to remain a sovereign great country then you must organize, mobilize, register, and vote Republican."
00:38:33 - 00:38:52 (19 sec),"We need more Republican votes. This election is about safety. And it's also about prosperity. Since the election, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. And we've added nearly one-half million manufacturing jobs. Think of that. If I ever said that during the cam -- look how many. Oh, man, that you are getting more and more people back there."
00:38:52 - 00:39:07 (16 sec),"Look how many reporters. Look. Wow, that's a lot. Wow. Wow. You know I call it? I call it the Academy Awards. That's the  Academy Award. You know we're doing great. Our new polls just came out. I had a poll, Rasmussen 51 or 52, they don't report that, they never report."
00:39:07 - 00:39:49 (41 sec),"But you know -- and It's much higher than that because some people -- I don't know if I'm happy about this, they say when they don't want to talk about it that means they're voting for Trump, I don't know, am I supposed to be thrilled? But we'll take it, right? Well take it. That's what happened in 2016. A lot of people didn't want to talk about it and the pollsters puts it down. OK, so -- but now they learned, they learned their lesson. When they don't talk they had Trump voters."
00:39:49 - 00:40:26 (38 sec),"All action. All action, no talk. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in recorded history. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. By the way, by the way, can you imagine during the debate if I have those stats, the best unemployment number ever for African-Americans. Best in terms of poverty ever in history for Africa."
00:40:26 - 00:41:02 (36 sec),"How do you win? How do you beat us on that? It's only habit. It's habit. Because for a hundred years, African-Americans have gone with Democrats but now they're changing, and they're changing fast and they're coming for us. Thank you, Kanye West. Thank you, Jim Brown. Big Jim Brown. Thank you, Iron Mike. I could go through -- We have so many people."
00:41:02 - 00:42:21 (79 sec),"Big Jim Brown. We could use him right now in the NFL, right? Great people. Hispanic- American and Asian-American, likewise, their unemployment rates have also reached all- time historic lows. The lowest. And women's unemployment just fell to 3.6%,  the lowest rate in 65 years. And we are, as of right now, the world's No.1 producer of crude oil and natural gas. Energy. No. 1.  No. 1. And since I took office, the value of Americans mutual funds and pension funds has increased by $2.7 trillion. That's your money, that's your money. And your 401(k)s. You all look like a bunch of geniuses, thank you, Donald, very much. You're all great investors, right?"
00:42:21 - 00:42:54 (33 sec),"You're all great investors. That's all good. We've picked up 11 -- I would say 10, I was saying seven. We picked up now 11.7% Larry Kudlow said it to me the other day, said, ""Sir, you're a little lower in that number.""  I said, ""Really?"" I was using $10 trillion. It's now $11.7 trillion in worth."
00:42:54 - 00:43:26 (32 sec),"Eleven. You know what that is? And China was catching us rapidly before I became president. And right now we are going so fast, we are the fastest developing country in the world. Can you believe that? Boom. Fastest in the world. [Crowd cheering] And that's why I say, ""We have a midterm coming up, an election."" Historically whoever's president -- I don't know why this works, but whoever's -- I guess people get complacent."
00:43:26 - 00:44:08 (42 sec),"You know, ""Hey, we just won the presidency."" Now two years later we have an election, so they are complacent and then we always win in the next one, which is, as you know, the presidential election. We always... So far I'm dreaming of those candidates. I see those candidates before my eyes."
00:44:08 - 00:44:54 (45 sec),"Every night before I go to sleep, sometimes while I'm sleeping I love them so much. Cory Booker, Pocahontas, Pocahontas. I've got more Indian blood in me than Pocahontas, and I have none, I mean, sadly I have none, but I have more than she does. They said to her, ""Why do you say you're of Indian heritage?"" Well, my mother told my high cheekbones that's the answer."
00:44:54 - 00:45:39 (46 sec),"Do you have any documentation? No, we don't. ""Oh, I see. Your high cheekbones."" Well I have high cheekbones too. Hey, maybe I'm an Indian and I'm going to do very well. But think of it. This is her reason. The whole thing has been [Inaudible] but that's OK. You know what, I want to be careful. I'm taking out so many of these people, I'm hitting them so hard that they're disappearing and I don't want to do that because I make it somebody that's actually good to run against me and that would not be good."
00:45:39 - 00:46:34 (55 sec),"I'll take out all the easy ones and maybe I'll get stuck with somebody that's actually good,  but I don't see any on that side. Well, Sleepy Joe Biden, who -- who ran for president two or three times, you know they say only twice. I think I remember a third time in there. But he had 1% with an arrow pointing left."
00:46:34 - 00:47:23 (50 sec),"That means 1% or less. And then Obama took him off the trash heap while he's one of the people. Remember he challenged me to a fight? ""I'd like to take him behind the bar."" I love that. That would be great. That would not last long. That would not last long. That wouldn't last long. Go like this. He's down. And he'll never get up. He will never get up. He will never get up. Now I got to leave their candidates alone."
00:47:23 - 00:47:42 (18 sec),"Somebody actually said, ""You're hitting these candidates really hard."" He's a non-candidate, you know, Don Mandic. He's a Da Nang Dick. He's Da Nang Dick. That's  Blumenthal. He talked about, ""When I was in Da Nang province in Vietnam and I was fighting up the hill in Minner going left and right of me they're dying."
00:47:42 - 00:48:17 (35 sec),"They're being struck by bullets but I went back to their rescue. I went back and I got them. And then I made a second attempt and bullets are going left and right and over my shoulders and they're hitting my men."" And I used to think, ""Wow, this guy is a pretty brave guy.""  And then I found out he's a fraud. He never was in Vietnam. And he stopped campaigning because there was no way you could win."
00:48:17 - 00:48:58 (41 sec),"No way. And because it's Connecticut, where I guess only a Democrat -- Can you believe this? That's why Connecticut's such a mess right now. Only a Democrat -- Wait, you're going to see, it's a mess. General Electric just moved out. That doesn't help. But Da Nang and Dick and then I see him yesterday talking about a man who's No. 1 at Yale, has like this perfect record."
00:48:58 - 00:49:42 (44 sec),"The most incredible record. One of the reasons I picked him. He's like a perfect person in Da Nang Dick, who -- who said he was a great war hero and he never saw the country. This wasn't like saying, ""Yeah. I was in the army."" This is -- this is the guy that said he was charged up Da Nang. Da Nang province right down Da Nang. He's up that hill and he's taking bullets left and right, and he never saw the place, he was in the reserves cell. Remember that."
00:49:42 - 00:50:07 (25 sec),"And he said, ""I demand honesty."" This is true, exact words. I demand honesty, integrity and I demand that there's no lying going on, and I'm saying, ""Wait a minute."" I said,  ""That's the guy that lied about -- in the worst -- in the history of our country. If you look at it,  he lied. And this is one of the people, how bad."
00:50:07 - 00:50:29 (23 sec),"And then you have the Feinstein and you have all the others and you look at what's going on. You don't want those people in office, folks. You've got to have great Republican. And compare that with what you've seen with John Cornyn, who asked a great question to Dianne and got her a little off base, like you know John Cornyn of Texas."
00:50:29 - 00:50:51 (22 sec),"And Lindsey Graham, who did such a great job. Right. Did a great job. How good was Lindsey? How good was Lindsey? And you know what? He was speaking from the heart. He was speaking. And by the way, took a week but that extra week was a great thing because it showed no corroboration, no nothing. By the way, no nothing. How good was Senator Susan Collins yesterday."
00:50:51 - 00:51:14 (23 sec),"Really, really great. And Chuck Grassley. I'll tell you what, Chuck was great. He's got to be very happy with what we did on trade. Right, Chuck? From Iowa, great state. And Mitch McConnell, how good, how good? He was tough and smart. He was great. He worked hard and we got ourselves the finest legal mind. One of the finest human beings."
00:51:14 - 00:51:46 (32 sec),"And again what his family took. The horror that they had to endure by these people like Blumenthal and Cory Booker who was a disaster as the mayor of Newark New Jersey. What they had to take was a disgrace. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning. All right. Tired of winning. We want to win, win, win. Never get tired of winning. After years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation. you see what's happening."
00:51:46 - 00:52:07 (21 sec),"And I just left the United Nations last week, and I can tell you, and everybody else can tell you, and even the fake news can tell you, America is respected again. To create more jobs and rising wages. Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history by far."
00:52:07 - 00:52:54 (48 sec),"We also passed Veterans Choice, 44 years, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor, and we pay for it so they don't have to wait in line for 25 days, 38 days, 14 days, six days. They go out and they see a private doctor, they get themselves a good doctor. We paid the bill. It's frankly so simple but it took 44 years to get it done."
00:52:54 - 00:53:42 (48 sec),"We got it done. I'm going to getting it done. I'm good at getting it done.Now we also passed, this is 45 years, the VA accountability law to insure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable, you are fired, get out."
00:53:42 - 00:54:07 (25 sec),"And we've secured a record, $700 million and the next year $716 billion to rebuild our military and to give our brave warriors the largest pay raise in almost a decade."
00:54:07 - 00:54:56 (49 sec),"And at my direction, The Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces the space force, a very serious stuff. That's happening quickly, it's very serious, that's where it's at. You know you have to know where it's at. Doesn't sound right, but it's right. That's where it's at."
00:54:56 - 00:55:20 (24 sec),"Both defense and offense that's where it's at. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. You know, before I became president, I looked at what was happening with Iran. They were taken over the Middle East, they were taking Syria. They were taking them."
00:55:20 - 00:56:22 (62 sec),"They were going into Iraq, they were taking everything. Now, they just want to make it, they just want to -- say they have riots in every city. Since I took over that operation, that horrible, horrible deal that was the thick of it. The previous administration gave Iran $150 billion and even crazier, they gave him at $1.8 billion dollars in cash. Cash."
00:56:22 - 00:57:07 (45 sec),"Airplanes. Airplanes full of cash. Fact I got in, I said, ""This is the president of the United States. I actually have the power to give away $1.8 billion in cash?"" You know what the answer is? It's actually no, they don't. What they did there is a disgrace. They gave them 1.8 in order to have a terrible deal."
00:57:07 - 00:57:45 (38 sec),"Well that was a hostage so they paid $1.8 billion. They paid $1.8 billion for hostages. Can you imagine? And we got our hostages back from North Korea, right? Noting. Zero. And we have a good relationship. And who knows what happens? But I think good things happen. No more missile testing, no more rocket testing, no more nuclear testing."
00:57:45 - 00:58:26 (41 sec),"We got the remains of our great, great heroes from 75 years ago back. And they keep coming back. And we got our hostages back. And good things are happening over there. You know what I always say is this, just before we signed the deal with Canada and Mexico, great deal, I said, ""Who knows?"" I never like to say -- how could you say? It's a deal."
00:58:26 - 00:58:56 (30 sec),"Who knows? I like to do -- it takes all the pressure off. Who knows? With North Korea, who knows? But I think we're doing very well. OK? The fake news says, ""Why aren't you going faster?"" I said, Listen, I just got back three months ago, right. I was there with Kim Jong-un. I was there three months ago. Chairman Kim."" They say, ""Why aren't you going faster?"
00:58:56 - 00:59:29 (32 sec),"I said, ""What have people done for 75 years? 75. This is three months."" And one of the Akers said, ""Why has the president given away so much? And I said, ""What have I given? I haven't given anything."" We've got our hostages back for nothing, out of respect. We got our remains back. We got the testing all stopped including the nuclear testing."
00:59:29 - 00:59:54 (26 sec),"I said, ""Tell me what have we given?"" ""Well, ah, ah, you -- you agreed to meet."" Oh, that does cost me very much, I agreed to meet. I like to meet. I like to meet. What the hell we lose by meeting. I asked the previous administration. Now that's what I gave away, I agreed to meet. Can you believe it? These people are sick. I agreed to meet."
00:59:54 - 01:00:25 (31 sec),"Can you imagine how well we do if we actually had fair press? Can you imagine? No, could you imagine? Instead of fake news. I agreed to meet. I'm sorry I agreed to meet. And then they said. right. You know, the rhetoric was extremely tough that first couple of months. And President Obama said at my meeting with him he said, ""The biggest problem we have by far is North Korea."""
01:00:25 - 01:00:42 (17 sec),"They would have gone to war. Millions and millions of people would have been killed. Millions of people. And I said to somebody in their administration. Have you ever talked? Have you ever agreed to meet? Have you ever like sit down and talk? ""Well we haven't thought about."" Oh, I see you're going to war, you're not going to talk."
01:00:42 - 01:01:02 (20 sec),"We'll beat anybody. What we have now coming in, I'm telling you it's the greatest power we've ever had, the greatest power in the world. You know why I have that? Because I don't want to use it. And when you have it, nobody is going to mess with us. OK. Nobody. I don't want to use it. Greatest power in the world."
01:01:02 - 01:01:33 (31 sec),"$716 billion, greatest power in the world. But we're doing great. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. That's the other story I tell. That's the other story we tell. That's a big one. That's a big, big story. You know why? Because other presidents all said, there are many, many presidents, ""We're going to do it. We're going to do it."""
01:01:33 - 01:01:44 (10 sec),"Then the pressure goes on and they don't do it. And I see why, I don't blame them. Every leader called me, ""Don't do it, please. Don't do it, don't do it."" You know the story I refused to take their phone calls."
01:01:44 - 01:02:05 (21 sec),"I said, ""Tell them I'll call them back on Thursday next week."" And I'm signing like on Wednesday. Tell him I'm calling him back on Thursday. I look forward to speaking to him. I signed the deal. Now's the deal, then I call him back. ""Yeah. Hi. How are you doing?  What's up?"" Wow. ""We wanted to talk to you about Israel but it's a little late."""
01:02:05 - 01:02:32 (27 sec),"And the embassy, which was going to cost over a billion dollars, we built it for about $400,000, right, you know that, right. And the billion would have taken probably 20 years before you ever got to build it. And we took a piece of land that we own, already own, and it had a building on it. OK building. We fixed the building up a little bit."
01:02:32 - 01:02:51 (19 sec),"We took the big space in the corner. We used even Jerusalem stone, which is a very expensive if you're a building. Jerusalem stone is beautiful. How nice is that? And you know Jerusalem stone in Jerusalem sounds about right. We got it for the right price. And we built it for less than $500,000. Now think of it."
01:02:51 - 01:03:30 (39 sec),"And we opened it up and it's open now, we have our embassy. So we saved a billion dollars in twenty years and we have our embassy. We could do that with hundreds of this. For years you watched as your leaders apologize for America and now you have a president who is standing up for America. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Kansas and we're standing proudly."
01:03:30 - 01:04:29 (58 sec),"We're standing proudly for our great national anthem, right. I just helped Canada and the NFL make a deal that they've been trying to make for years. Can you believe it? Canada was taking advantage of the NFL. The NFL couldn't get it done. It took me about two seconds because it's pea -- It's, you know, it's a lot of money but it's not compared to corn, and crops, and dairy, and milk, and cars, and steel, and everything else. It's peanuts. I say you got to take care of it right. Because I want to help American companies. It took me like two minutes and we get it done. And I got a call from the commissioner of the NFL and I thought he was calling me to ask me to stop haunting them about standing for the American flag and for our national.."
01:04:29 - 01:05:05 (36 sec),"And he didn't. He called me to thank me. He said, ""The previous administration could not get it done. And you got it done. We didn't even know what you were trying to do it."" So now they'll have a lot more money to give to their players and their players will still hate me, but that's OK. Stand for it, just as long as they stand. Just as long as they stand for our flag and our anthem I don't care how they feel about that."
01:05:05 - 01:05:33 (28 sec),"But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends your family your neighbors your co-workers and get out and vote Republican, we need more people in D.C.. We don't have enough. Vote to send Kris Kobach to the governor's mansion and vote to send Steve Watkins to Congress. We always vote for Trump."
01:05:33 - 01:06:01 (28 sec),"A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products made right here in the USA. Finally, finally. We want it made here. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement, and that's what they are. They're our heroes."
01:06:01 - 01:06:31 (30 sec),"And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division,  and destruction, and to reclaim America's true heritage and righteous destiny. We're losing that with these crazy loco people. To everyone in this room tonight, that's a lot of people, to every citizen watching across our land."
01:06:31 - 01:07:04 (33 sec),This is your time to choose. It's a time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustration of the past or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. It's not up to the media. It's not up to the pundits. It's up to you to decide your fate.
01:07:04 - 01:07:18 (14 sec),"And remember this, what happened in 2016, and what's happening even more so now, I believe, because I've produced, and people see I produced, one of them said, ""He made a lot of promises and he actually produced more than he made promises."""
01:07:18 - 01:07:51 (33 sec),"I mean, you know, think about it. I did. I did. You have the power with your vote. To defend your family, your community, your country, and everything we hold sacred, and righteous, and true. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to every day great American patriots."
01:07:51 - 01:08:20 (30 sec),"The state of Kansas was set up by tough pioneer men and strong women, who defied danger and brave the wilderness to build a beautiful life on the plains. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Strong Women, strong women, strong."
01:08:20 - 01:08:52 (31 sec),"I'm sorry, fellas, stronger than the men, I'm sorry, fellas. Strong. They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury but they all had one thing in common, they love their families, they love their country, and they loved their god."
01:08:52 - 01:09:29 (37 sec),"These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud and great American heritage. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children we are going to work, we are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win."
01:09:29 - 01:10:13 (44 sec),"We will not ban. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people. One Family. And one glorious nation under God."
01:10:13 - 01:10:42 (28 sec),"And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kansas. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:43 (43 sec),"That's right, USA. And hello, Kentucky. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in the heartland with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots. In just 24 days, the people of Kentucky -- we love Kentucky -- greatest horses in the world and plenty of other things -- are going to elect an incredible slate of Republican candidates to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and continue making America great again."
00:00:43 - 00:01:36 (54 sec),"Just hours ago, we celebrated another tremendous victory for the American people. You know what I'm talking about. We're having a lot of victories, folks. Can you handle it? In the Oval Office of the White House, I welcomed home Pastor Andrew Brunson, great man, from Turkey. He is now free from jail. Think of that, 35-year jail sentence, 35 years."
00:01:36 - 00:02:07 (31 sec),"Not anymore. He's back with his family, together with his wife, and he is on American soil. And it's a beautiful family. They're all together. And I want to thank President Erdogan of Turkey. He was -- he was terrific. We all worked together. It wasn't easy. It wasn't easy. That one wasn't easy. And we don't pay ransom."
00:02:07 - 00:02:45 (38 sec),"We don't pay ransom. But I do -- I want to thank the president. I want to thank the people of Turkey. And I think we'll probably now really establish a terrific relationship with Turkey. We appreciate it. This evening, in the wake of Hurricane Michael, our thoughts are with our fellow citizens in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia."
00:02:45 - 00:03:37 (52 sec),"They got hit hard. They got hit hard, especially when you look at -- when you look at Florida, did you ever see anything like that? And you look at Georgia, Georgia got hit hard. That was some wind force. Up to 200 miles -- almost 200 miles an hour, one of the most vicious we've ever been hit with. So I just want to thank all of those incredible people, the people of FEMA, the first responders... law enforcement, and all of the thousands of federal employees and National Guard, all of the personnel, they're now on the ground, they're supporting this really major recovery."
00:03:37 - 00:04:00 (23 sec),"I will say, you have thousands of electrical trucks all lined up, they're following in, they're getting the roads cleared, not easy. And they have done some job. You had 600,000 people without electric. In one day, they got it down to 250,000. That's some job, one day. And we will not rest until the job is done."
00:04:00 - 00:04:42 (42 sec),"We're here tonight to discuss everything we have accomplished together in less than two years' time. Think of it. Think of it. And I'm here tonight, although I've been back many times, I love this state... to thank the people of Kentucky for 2016. We didn't have to wait too long for that. We didn't have to wait too long for that."
00:04:42 - 00:05:16 (33 sec),"Remember, the vote is in, the polls have closed in Kentucky, Donald Trump is the winner of Kentucky. That was fast. That was fast. And to make sure that America's extraordinary comeback, we want to make sure it continues full speed ahead. We don't want Democrats... that are coming from a different place, we don't want them getting in office."
00:05:16 - 00:06:27 (71 sec),"All they'll do is abstract. Under Republican leadership, America is booming. It's thriving. America is winning again because we are finally putting America first. [Audience chants USA] Our country's unemployment rate has just fallen to 3.7 percent, the lowest in over 50 years. Fifty years. Median household income has reached an all-time high."
00:06:27 - 00:06:57 (30 sec),"That's pretty good. It means you're making more money than you've ever made before. I don't know how much better, but we're going to get it up higher. We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And some of you will love this, and I'm proud of it, these are great people, it's a great resource when properly used."
00:06:57 - 00:07:39 (42 sec),"We have ended the war on clean, beautiful coal. We're putting our miners back to work like never before. They're going back, back, back. And after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. And we are doing it with American iron, aluminum, and look at what happened to steel."
00:07:39 - 00:08:10 (30 sec),"You see the comeback with steel? Everyone's going back to work. The steel mills are opening up, U.S. Steel, Nucor. They're all opening up their steel mills. That was faster than I thought. And we're stopping the dumping. And if they want to dump, they can but they got to pay a lot. So if you think about it, so true, despite our size, America is now the hottest country anywhere in the world."
00:08:10 - 00:08:42 (32 sec),"This is where people want to be. Since my election, we've picked up in worth $11.7 trillion. Think of that. Think of it. And we are going to get along great with China, but we're doing things with China, and they've dropped about $20 trillion. But you know what? They're going to be just fine, but they have to treat us fairly."
00:08:42 - 00:09:42 (61 sec),"They have to treat us fairly. Right? That's right. And every day, we are living by our motto, promises made, promises kept. [Audience Chants Trump] And you look back there at the fake news media, look at them. Look at them. It's like the Academy Awards every time. You know, I'd like to walk into a place one night and not have any of these guys."
00:09:42 - 00:10:09 (27 sec),"Boy. It gets bigger and bigger. But even they have said that President Trump, and you know they probably get fired the next day, that President Trump made promises during the campaign, and I've actually produced more than the promises I made. How often do you hear that? And we all produced it together. We have incredible people."
00:10:09 - 00:10:30 (21 sec),"Mitch and Rand, and we all produced it together. We have a great team. But we need more of them. We need more Republican votes. We have a majority that's essentially, Rand, not a majority. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority, right? So we have to get some more Republicans in there, and we're here for some good ones tonight."
00:10:30 - 00:10:55 (25 sec),"On Monday night at the White House, we kept one of the biggest and most historic promises of all. Do you know what we're talking about, right? Never has a man been treated so badly. America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. A great, great gentleman."
00:10:55 - 00:11:55 (60 sec),"What happened to him was so unfair. I've never seen anything like it. And we stuck with him all the way because we knew the facts. We stuck with him all the way. And Rand Paul and Mitch, they stuck with him. No doubts about it. No doubts. Remember that. Remember that. He now sits alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch to defend your sacred rights and your God-given freedom."
00:11:55 - 00:12:42 (47 sec),"What the crazy, radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh is a national disgrace. From the moment Brett Kavanaugh was known, well, you know what happened. We announced the name, we nominated him, and literally from the moment he was nominated, they didn't even know. It's actually, if you think of it, it's from before he was nominated, nobody knew anything about who it was going to be. I didn't even make my decision yet, and they started saying horrible things about whoever the person might be. They were on a mission to obstruct, resist, delay, demolish, and destroy."
00:12:42 - 00:13:16 (34 sec),"The Democrats have become totally consumed by their chilling lust for power. And I'll tell you something, we have a man, one of the most powerful men in the world, it's OK, comes from Kentucky, that's not bad. Got to respect that. And he heard about this, he says I want to be there. He's one of yours. He's joining us tonight."
00:13:16 - 00:13:51 (35 sec),"He's rock-ribbed Kentucky leader. He's been a leader for a long time. There's nobody tougher. There's nobody smarter. He refused to cave to the radical Democrats' shameful campaign of political and personal destruction. He stared down, tough cookie -- I know tough people, he's tough, he's Kentucky tough, which is about as tough... He stared down the angry left-wing mob."
00:13:51 - 00:13:56 (5 sec),"He never blinked, and he never looked back, and he got us a man who will be one of our great, great Supreme Court justices, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Come up here."
00:13:56 - 00:14:11 (15 sec),"Thank you, Kentucky. Aren't we proud of President Trump? Let me just add, thanks to President Trump and a Republican Senate, 84 new federal judges already this Congress. That's already a record, Mr. President. Keep sending them our way and we'll keep confirming them and change the court system forever. Thank you for being here."
00:14:11 - 00:15:36 (85 sec),"Thank you. And Mitch is a true fighter for Kentucky. He loves this state. And you know, we'll be running together in 2020. That will be a lot of fun. Thank you, Mitch. On this Election Day, November 6th, every American faces a simple choice. You can either vote for Democrat mob rule or you can vote for a Republican Party that stands proudly for law and order, fairness, freedom, and justice."
00:15:36 - 00:16:20 (44 sec),"Simple as that. If Nancy Pelosi... crying Chuck Schumer, and the radical Democrats take over Congress, they will try to raise your taxes, they will immediately restore job-killing regulations, they will impose, believe it or not, socialism, take away your health care, your health care and your whole life will be unaffordable, shut down immediately, oh, forget this one, shut down your coal mines in about two minutes."
00:16:20 - 00:16:49 (29 sec),"You see what's going on with the Second Amendment? They will destroy your Second Amendment. And the Democrats want to open our borders to a flood of deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The fact is, Democrats have become the party of crime. They have. Republicans are the party of safety, and we are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs."
00:16:49 - 00:17:25 (36 sec),"And we're thrilled to be joined this evening by several terrific Kentucky Republicans. First of all, Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? Thank you. Congressman Tom Massie. They've got them spread all over the place. Where's Tom? Doing a great job, thank you. They're doing a great job."
00:17:25 - 00:18:27 (62 sec),"Congressman Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Congressman James Comer, James Comer. Thanks, James. James, the whole group, they have been incredible, I'll tell you what. We got tax cuts, biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. We got so many other things. ANWR. We got rid of the individual mandate. We had Obamacare repealed and replaced."
00:18:27 - 00:19:08 (41 sec),"We didn't get one Democrat vote, but we'll get it done. We had a little disappointment that night. A little bit of a disappointment. But it's essentially done anyway, because when you get rid of the mandate, the individual mandate, it's done. And what we have done with the remnants of Obamacare is we've kept your premiums down far below what anybody would have thought, through good management, through Secretary Alex Azar."
00:19:08 - 00:19:40 (32 sec),"Now a friend of mine who has helped us so much, he's really smart, but I have to say his wife, the last couple of days, has become maybe the biggest star in the family. She's been so -- I said, Rand, you have to get her on television more. She's become the biggest star in the family. Yes. A man that really has been a friend of mine, a special friend, and he's really something."
00:19:40 - 00:20:15 (35 sec),"He's a great guy. Not everybody knows that, believe it or not. Not -- it's like Mitch, not everybody knows that Mitch is a great guy. These are great people. There's something that happens to you when you grow up in Kentucky, I guess, right? These are great people. But, you know, I call Rand a senator of tremendous common sense."
00:20:15 - 00:20:25 (9 sec),"That's a great compliment, common sense. And you know what? Hey, Rand, he's young, he's spry, run up here for a second, Rand. Come up here, Rand."
00:20:25 - 00:21:12 (47 sec),"The president said he's tired. I could take 20 or 30 minutes, right? Now, I'm going to tell you a very quick story about the president, and this shows how he's different than any politician and why you're all out here. I went to him with an idea on health care. I said, let's let individuals buy it in a group."
00:21:12 - 00:21:34 (22 sec),"Let them join an association. Let competition drive prices down. The president said, it's a great idea. What did he staff say? Oh, no, we could never do that. What did all the middle managers say? Oh, we could never do that. And you know what the president said? Make it so. And he did it."
00:21:34 - 00:22:21 (47 sec),"But it's true. We were talking about health care and Rand had this concept that -- he was so far advanced, even the experts didn't know, and after they checked, they said, you know, he's right. He's right. Association health care, where you can team up with other companies, you can team up -- you go in, you get phenomenal pricing, you have no problems with crossing borders, so you get every insurance company, and it's taken off, Rand, and that was Rand's initial idea."
00:22:21 - 00:22:49 (28 sec),"That's true. And it's doing really well. Inexpensive and terrific. And another man, a very special friend of mine, he was a great businessman, decided to win and run in Kentucky. By the way, does that sound familiar? This guy was a really successful guy and he saw things happening in Kentucky, and he said, you know, I can do a tremendous job, and he really has done."
00:22:49 - 00:23:15 (26 sec),"And he doesn't want to be political. He wants to get the job done. This state is doing so well. You have your lowest unemployment numbers in history. You have your best incomes in history. You have jobs and companies flowing back in. And all of that wouldn't matter if I didn't like him, because if I didn't like him, I'd say, forget about him, right?"
00:23:15 - 00:23:59 (44 sec),"But I like him a lot. He's a terrific man and a terrific governor, Matt Bevin. Thank you, Matt. Thanks, Matt. So we're here for a truly special guy. These are all special people. Something about this place. Boy, did we win by a lot. What did we win by, 38? Thirty-eight. We won by a lot. I have a feeling that Mitch McConnell in two years is going to do very good, very good."
00:23:59 - 00:24:16 (17 sec),"He's going to do very good. You know, he goes down as the greatest leader, in my opinion, in history. What we've done is incredible together. But he's better when I'm president than he ever was when anyone else was president. Doing much better. But I want to introduce the leader that we're all here for tonight."
00:24:16 - 00:25:01 (45 sec),"And all of our congressmen know exactly what I'm talking about. He has been so strong on all of the things that we stand for, tax cuts, regulation cuts. Every single event that we passed, and it's record numbers of events, he's been at the forefront, and he's got a little bit of a tough race with a Nancy Pelosi-picked figure."
00:25:01 - 00:25:19 (18 sec),"And I guess they did a little changing, and they did a lot of this and that, the Democrats do, that's the only way they can win. But I'll tell you what, I've seen the -- you know, outside, you have 25,000, 35,000, some crazy number of people, and we set up movie screens. We set up beautiful movie screens."
00:25:19 - 00:25:47 (27 sec),"And to those people outside, we love you. We love you. You have to see the lines, they go all the way back, many miles. But a lot of them stayed and they're watching screens outside. I like your location better, do you agree? But this is a special guy, and normally I wouldn't make a trip, but here I have two reasons."
00:25:47 - 00:26:20 (33 sec),"One was I love the state of Kentucky. And the other was that Andy Barr is a great congressman. Andy, come on up. [Audience Chants Andy]"
00:26:20 - 00:27:07 (47 sec),"Mr. President, welcome to Kentucky's Sixth Congressional District. A swing district that two years ago, you sent a message to the nation because you won it by 15 points. And welcome to Madison County, a county, Mr. President, that you won by a whopping 32 points. Home of Eastern Kentucky University, where we are right now, the most pro-veteran university in America."
00:27:07 - 00:27:50 (42 sec),"Home to workers who relocated from Eastern Kentucky, who value a paycheck to put food on the table, and, Mr. President, thank you for ending the war on coal. And Madison County, home of the Department of Criminal Justice Training, the Kentucky State Police, two awesome police departments, and Democrat Sheriff Mike Coyle, the sheriff of the year, who says, Mr. President, to keep the drugs out of our communities, we need to build the wall."
00:27:50 - 00:28:28 (38 sec),"[Audience Chants Build the Wall] And when I first met you -- when I first met you, Mr. President, I told you about our drug problem in Kentucky, and you listened. And six months later, I was in the White House with you when you declared a national public health emergency to fight the drug epidemic, the opioid epidemic."
00:28:28 - 00:29:09 (40 sec),"And we worked together and we funded the most significant investment to fight a drug crisis in American history. This president is a man of action. A man of action. Other people resist, but this president gets results. And so I want to turn it over to him, but I just want to remember one special night two years ago in Cleveland, the moment I knew this man would be the next president of the United States."
00:29:09 - 00:29:31 (22 sec),"Remember? Remember what he said. He said that my opponent has a slogan, and that slogan is I'm with her. Remember what he said next? What he said was, I have a different slogan, and that slogan is: I'm with you, the American people. Mr. President, I'm with you to fight for the American people!"
00:29:31 - 00:30:12 (41 sec),"Thank you. That's pretty good. Now, you know, the one thing that Andy didn't say is that she paid a lot of money for that slogan. And the morning after I came up with my little feel on it, they changed the slogan. It was gone. It was gone. But we weren't gone, because this was the single greatest movement in the history of American politics."
00:30:12 - 00:30:28 (16 sec),"And our slogan was a great slogan. I think it's the greatest slogan that anybody will ever come up with. Although in two years, we have a new one, you know what that is. Ours is make America great again. Look at all these hats. And at the rate we're going, it's going to happen fast, it's called keep America great."
00:30:28 - 00:31:10 (42 sec),"It's got to be that. Right? So I'm here for Andy Barr. And that's a vote for safe communities, strong borders, and Kentucky values. Andy Barr. A vote for Andy's opponent, I had to do a little checking, who's he running against? Who? This is an extreme liberal named Amy McGrath. Chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, that's a real beauty... and the radical Democrat mob."
00:31:10 - 00:31:51 (41 sec),"Now, Amy supports a socialist takeover of your health care, which by the way means your taxes are going to triple if you're lucky. She supports open borders. She needs the tax hikes to cover the through-the-roof garbage that you want no part of. And she wants to immediately decimate your now-thriving coal industry."
00:31:51 - 00:32:30 (39 sec),"So if you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker of the House -- no, we can't do that. That will not be good. Then you have to get out and vote for Andy Barr, a great man. Great man. You know, actually, I must tell you, Kentucky, you're always involved at the middle of politics. The election of Andy is a very important thing, could make the difference between unbelievable continued success and, frankly, failure, where we fight for two more years with these people, with these obstructionists."
00:32:30 - 00:33:14 (44 sec),"So it's really an important race. It could be the congressman up -- I don't know if they're worried about them. They're so far ahead in their races. We don't have to talk about them anymore, right? We don't have to talk about them. We don't have to talk about them, but we were talking backstage, and they said it. This could be the most important race there is. So get out and vote."
00:33:14 - 00:34:03 (49 sec),"We can't let this happen. A majority of House Democrats have already signed up for socialist health care. By the way, it doesn't work anywhere in the world. Just so you understand. It doesn't work. It's good if you don't mind waiting like five weeks to see a doctor. They come from socialist countries. Frankly, they come from Canada, because they want to use our doctors."
00:34:03 - 00:34:57 (54 sec),"They come from all over the world. And we're making it now better. And they want to destroy everything that's been built, all of that great foundation. They want to outlaw the private insurance plans of 2.4 million Kentucky residents. And some of those plans are fantastic and inexpensive. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for nearly 250,000 Kentucky seniors who depend on it. Republicans want to protect Medicare, and we will, for our great seniors who have earned it and who have paid for it. And Republicans only will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions."
00:34:57 - 00:35:32 (35 sec),"We're going to protect it. The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and it's open borders. Democrats want to abolish ICE and they want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and MS-13 thugs. And don't kid yourself, that's what's going to happen. And they want to get rid of ICE."
00:35:32 - 00:35:56 (23 sec),"They think ICE isn't nice. Did you ever see what they're dealing with? First of all, they're incredible patriots. They have a job that nobody in this group wants. They go in there and they meet the most vile, most vicious people on earth like it's a day at the office. You don't want to do it. You don't want to -- yeah, you might do it. This guy might do it. You want a job?"
00:35:56 - 00:36:25 (29 sec),"I'll get it to you with a -- look at this guy, this guy will do it. I'm looking at -- he might do it. You might do it. But you don't want to do it. They go in there and they liberate towns. These people came in by the thousands, and we're taking them out by the thousands. They're getting out. They're getting out."
00:36:25 - 00:37:01 (36 sec),"Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans -- and you know this, you know this -- Republicans stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. You know that. One by one, we are finding the illegal alien criminals, predators, drug dealers, MS-13 killers, and we are sending them back home."
00:37:01 - 00:37:31 (30 sec),"We are liberating America's cities and towns. That's what we're doing. The only immigration policy Democrats support is catch and release. How about that one? You catch a criminal thug, you take their name, and then you release them, say please show up in five years to court. Now, number one, it's ridiculous."
00:37:31 - 00:38:04 (34 sec),"Number two, they never show up. What a mess. We have the dumbest immigration laws in the world. The world laughs at us, but we're getting them changed. We need some more Republicans. We need some votes. And if you elect Republicans this November, we will pass legislation to end catch and release. We will -- I'll tell you, have you heard the other one?"
00:38:04 - 00:38:42 (38 sec),"Right? Lottery. Lottery. Lottery. OK? Names, you pick them out, coming to the United States. Now, let me ask you, these countries set up lotteries. Do you really believe they're giving us their finest? No. This is a lottery. This was Chuck Schumer's special deal for this country. And we need to elect people so we get rid of it. We got -- maybe just get rid of it. How crazy."
00:38:42 - 00:39:15 (33 sec),"How crazy. How -- and then you have chain migration. You know what that is, right? So we had a man, horrible person, the west side in Manhattan, where I live, where I love, right along the Hudson River. He's driving a car down this roadway where the speed limit is 35. He's going about 70. And he decides to make a right turn into a beautiful park that goes along the river with lots of people."
00:39:15 - 00:39:43 (28 sec),"Many people were killed. Nobody ever talks about the people that were horribly injured. They lost legs, they lost arms. These are people that were running. They want to keep themselves in shape. They were working out. They were walking hand-in-hand together. They're dead. They're horribly wounded. Many will never, ever recover."
00:39:43 - 00:40:14 (31 sec),"Now, what happens? What happened to him? It will be years of litigation. He came in, and then he took chain migration, and he brought his mother, and his father, and his brother, and his sister, and his aunt, and his grandfather. None of them working. It ended up being approximately 22 people who came in. It's called a chain."
00:40:14 - 00:40:59 (45 sec),"Isn't that wonderful? A chain. And we're stuck with them. We're stuck with these people. And I don't want a chain. I want people to come into our country on a merit-based system. And I want them to help all of the great companies that are moving back into the United States. They're moving to Michigan, they're moving to Ohio, they're moving to Pennsylvania, they're moving to North and South Carolina."
00:40:59 - 00:41:25 (26 sec),"They're coming in. They're moving to Florida. And, yes, they're moving into Kentucky. And with what we've done, we've become so successful that we need people to come in with all these companies that are coming in. But we want great people that love our country, that respect our country, and that want to work."
00:41:25 - 00:42:09 (43 sec),"This election is about safety and it is about prosperity. Since the last election -- and these are numbers that the fakers back there, the fake news, would never have allowed me to say. They'd never in a million years, if I ever said this during the campaign, they would've had headlines. We've created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps."
00:42:09 - 00:42:41 (33 sec),"You know what that means? The second, food stamps. It means, number one, we get rid of an unbelievable cost. You wouldn't even believe it. But you know what else? You got a lot of happy people that are working. It's a great thing. It's a great thing. We've added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing's never going to come back?"
00:42:41 - 00:43:16 (34 sec),"Never going to come back, remember? The previous administration, oh, you think that's going to happen? You'd need a magic wand. Well, I guess we had the magic wand. We had the magic wand. And these are great jobs and these are important jobs. Manufacturing jobs, companies pouring back in. Manufacturing. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded in history."
00:43:16 - 00:43:59 (43 sec),"African-American poverty has reached its lowest level in history. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history. I can't believe I'm still saying this. I am so sorry, I apologize to the women in the room. Remember, I got 52 percent -- remember, they kept saying, he's not -- the fake news -- that's right."
00:43:59 - 00:44:43 (44 sec),"Remember he said -- they were all saying he will not do well with women? Wow, did we do well with women. Did we do well. Fake news. We did really well with women. But, unfortunately, the women's unemployment, Mitch, is not at a historic low. It's only the best number in 65 years. We let down women. We let down women."
00:44:43 - 00:45:12 (30 sec),"Sixty-five years, 3.6 percent. As the charts grow just a little bit, it will be historic very soon. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning. You know about winning. You really know about winning. Those horses win. You people are winners. I'm just afraid that Kentucky is winning too much."
00:45:12 - 00:45:40 (28 sec),"[Audience calls out No] You're going to send Matt Bevin to see Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, and they're going to all come to the Oval Office to see me, and they're going to say, Mr. President, we can't do it anymore. Kentucky is winning too much. They can't do it. They don't like it. They don't want to do it anymore."
00:45:40 - 00:46:07 (27 sec),"They're going to say, we're winning so much, we just can't stand it. I'm going to say, Mitch and Matt and Rand, I'm sorry. We're going to keep winning. We're going to win more and more and more. We're going to keep winning. I'm sorry, folks. And I will send them happily back to Kentucky. You're winning a lot."
00:46:07 - 00:46:44 (37 sec),"We won today. We won today with the great pastor, Pastor Brunson. Last week, I announced that we are replacing the horror show, one of the worst trade deals ever made, known as NAFTA, with an incredible, brand-new U.S. Mexico-Canada agreement called the USMCA, USMCA. And even the Democrats are saying, wow, what a good deal that is. They can't believe it. We actually, Mitch, get bipartisan support."
00:46:44 - 00:47:21 (37 sec),"Can you believe it? Although, if it's too good, they won't support it. That's the problem. No, I will say, even Chuck Schumer liked it. Can you believe that one? He said that's a good deal. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices. China -- and I have great respect for China, we all do, and I have great respect and like him for President Xi, the absolute head -- this is an absolute head of China."
00:47:21 - 00:48:03 (42 sec),"But you know what? They've been making $300 billion to $500 billion a year, taking it out of our country. We have rebuilt China. And I don't blame China. They can get away -- I blame our past leaders, because they should never have let it happen. I don't blame China. And thanks to our strong trade and economic policies, Brady Industries recently broke ground on a new billion-dollar aluminum mill that will create up to 1,500 jobs right next to Ashland, Kentucky."
00:48:03 - 00:48:37 (34 sec),"You know where we're talking about, right? Right? Ashland. Under Republican leadership, we also passed the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. Bigger than any have ever been passed. We have taken historic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. You saw three weeks ago, Pfizer, Novartis, a lot of drug companies announced a very substantial increase."
00:48:37 - 00:49:07 (30 sec),"Then I said to Secretary Alex Ocasa -- and I said to Alex Azar, this is no good. This is no good. We got to do something. I want to call them. And I called the head of Pfizer, big company -- I guess like the biggest -- big, big drug company. I called Novartis. I called the heads of these companies, and they said, sir, sir, we will immediately drop the price back to where it was."
00:49:07 - 00:49:35 (28 sec),"Did you ever hear of that? And Rand Paul, it's the first time I realized how powerful it was to be the president of the United States. No, they -- they reduced -- now, I -- and by the way, I kid, but I do, I respect that they did that. I really appreciate it. And now because of what Secretary Azar is doing, you're going to see drug pricing, prescription drugs going down."
00:49:35 - 00:50:04 (29 sec),"You know, we have countries -- we have countries on this planet, the exact same pill, the exact same prescription, made in the exact same factory or plant, in Canada and in other countries all over the world, is much less, sometimes 50 percent, sometimes more than that, it's much less than what Americans pay."
00:50:04 - 00:50:40 (36 sec),"We're getting rid of the middleman. We're doing a number -- I'm going to be hated so much by some people in this country that made a fortune. But we're getting drug prices way down. And we started it last Friday with the signing of two bills. And something that the congressman really helped me with, all of them in the room and Andy, in particular, we help right now get critically ill, terminal patients access to life-saving treatments."
00:50:40 - 00:51:08 (27 sec),"We just passed right to try. Right to try. I hope nobody has to use it in this room. But this is a person who's terminally ill -- we have the greatest drug companies and the greatest research in the world by far, nobody close. But we have a pipeline that would take 12 to 15 years to get it approved and through the pipeline."
00:51:08 - 00:51:32 (25 sec),"We have that down, I think, to four years and maybe less, but we have to be careful. But if we had something that really showed great promise toward a problem that somebody had, who's terminally ill, for 44 years, they've been trying to get this passed. They couldn't. Not as easy as it sounds. Between the insurance companies, the liabilities, the country itself, the lawsuits."
00:51:32 - 00:51:58 (26 sec),"So I got everybody in a room, we got to get life -- this is really important stuff. Excuse me, how many of you know friends? If they have money, they travel all over the world, begging and looking for a cure. They want hope. If they don't have money, they go home, they have no hope. And we got right to try passed a month-and-a-half ago and already it's had an incredible impact."
00:51:58 - 00:52:36 (38 sec),"Incredible impact, 44 years. So now a patient is terminally ill, we have something that's looking really good, we make them sign a document, very important document, and they go in and we work with them and we see if we can help them. And we've had some incredible results already. So I just want to thank Andy Barr and all of the congressmen here and Mitch and Rand, because we got it passed."
00:52:36 - 00:53:17 (40 sec),"We got it passed. But to me that was a big thing. Many, many, many years they worked on it, they couldn't get it done. We also passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor instead of waiting online for 12 days, for 24 days, for 38 days. We have our great veterans -- we're doing a great job with our veterans -- we have our -- but this was one of the most important things -- because they'd be waiting in line for sometimes months if you can believe it. We had people waiting in line and they weren't very sick."
00:53:17 - 00:53:41 (24 sec),"By the time they saw a doctor, they were terminally ill. Now, if there's a line, if there's a way, because we have great doctors in the V.A. That's one thing we -- I'll tell you, everybody tells me. You can't get to them. Now, if there's a wait, you go to a local doctor, you get yourself taken care of, and we pay for the bill."
00:53:41 - 00:54:09 (28 sec),"We pay for the bill. That was another one. That was another one. Took over 40 years. I used to say to people, why don't we do that? I thought I was so smart. I said, listen, I got a great idea. These lines are terrible, 28 days, 30 days. I got a great idea. It's the greatest idea I think I've ever had. We're going to have them go to a private doctor instead of waiting on line."
00:54:09 - 00:54:49 (41 sec),"Sir, we've been trying to get that passed for 40 years. Oh, you've heard about it before? Everybody heard -- they couldn't get it passed. But we're going at getting things passed. We got it passed. Rand and Mitch and Andy, we got it passed. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable."
00:54:49 - 00:55:29 (40 sec),"Jim, you mistreated our veteran, Jim. Jim, you're fired, get out. We just secured $700 billion and $716 billion, two years, to fully rebuild the American military. Bigger, stronger, more powerful than ever before, and we are giving our warriors their largest pay raise in over a decade. And at my direction -- and we need Rand and we need Mitch's help, but it's really popular -- let them know how popular this is -- you know, it's all about space."
00:55:29 - 00:55:48 (19 sec),"It's all about space. Defense, offense, everything, it's going to soon be all about space. So let Rand and Mitch know about this. Ready? At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces known as the Space Force. Now they have to do it. I put them on the spot."
00:55:48 - 00:56:23 (35 sec),"I put them on the spot. Now, they have to do it. No, it's very popular. One of the biggest applause I get wherever I go is when I talk about the Space Force. And, by the way, China, already started. Russia, already started. They've got to start, but we have the greatest people in the world. We make the greatest equipment in the world."
00:56:23 - 00:56:54 (31 sec),"We make the greatest rockets and missiles and tanks and ships in the world. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. You know, when I came to office, weeks before I was given rundowns of what's happening, and Iran was just a question of when will they take over the entire Middle East?"
00:56:54 - 00:57:13 (19 sec),"They're not thinking about that anymore, folks. They're not thinking about it anymore. They've got a little disaster going. They have riots in the street. Their currency is shot. And they'll be coming to us some day, probably not too far out, and they'll say we'd like to make a deal. And that's fine. That's good."
00:57:13 - 00:58:05 (51 sec),"But a real deal. Not the joke of a deal that was made by the past administration. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Right? Together we have made extraordinary progress, but we're just getting started. If you vote to elect Republican House and Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes very, very substantially."
00:58:05 - 00:58:57 (52 sec),"We, unlike the Democrats, will protect Medicare and protect Social Security. Remember what I said during the debates? We will protect them. We will defend your Second Amendment and protect your right to free speech and religious liberty. With your help, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, and all of the people that work so well with us will continue to confirm incredible pro-Constitution judges, not radical far-left judges who will rewrite your Constitution and replace your Kentucky values."
00:58:57 - 00:59:17 (20 sec),"Not going to happen. Eighty-four judges -- think of that, it's a record -- it's a record -- and we actually have a lot to go, 84 judges approved. What a difference. Going to be, by the time we finish, maybe 50 percent of the court. Do you know what that is? Fifty percent. We will fully secure the border."
00:59:17 - 00:59:55 (39 sec),"We will pass Kate's law, stop sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery, end chain migration, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity."
00:59:55 - 01:00:39 (43 sec),"But to achieve this future, to continue the greatest movement in the history of our country and maybe of any country, you need to vote Republican. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for the great people of Kentucky."
01:00:39 - 01:01:28 (49 sec),"And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. On November 6th, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote for Andy Barr. Great man. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, and more products made right here in the good, old USA."
01:01:28 - 01:02:05 (38 sec),"It's about to respect our laws and to respect the heroes of law enforcement. They are heroes. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division, and to celebrate the greatness and the glory of being an American. It is not up to the media, it's not up to the pundits, it's up to you to decide your own fate."
01:02:05 - 01:02:59 (53 sec),"You have the power with your vote to defend your family, defend your country, defend your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country, returning power to the American people. This great state was settled by really -- I mean, how tough, how smart -- by tough, tough men and even tougher women, by the way."
01:02:59 - 01:03:37 (38 sec),"But it was settled by tough men, pioneer women who braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God."
01:03:37 - 01:04:07 (31 sec),"These courageous Kentucky patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage. For the sake of our freedom, and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win."
01:04:07 - 01:04:59 (51 sec),"We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to glorious victory, because we are American, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
01:04:59 - 01:05:23 (24 sec),"And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Vote for Andy Barr."
00:00:00 - 00:00:56 (56 sec),"So this is supposed to be a Democrat state. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. They have a very big surprise coming, don't you think? Very big surprise. Hello, Minnesota. Great state. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in the heartland with thousands of hard-working and truly great American patriots."
00:00:56 - 00:01:35 (39 sec),"You know that. In less than two years of Republican leadership, America has achieved the biggest comeback in our history. True. Jobs are booming, wages are rising and the number of Americans working right now today has reached an all-time high in our history. We are defending our great Second Amendment... taking care of our wonderful veterans, who we love and respect... and our military will soon be more powerful than ever before by far."
00:01:35 - 00:02:23 (48 sec),"But the radical Democrats want to take it all away. They want to destroy our prosperity. We've had great prosperity. You see what's happening. You don't want your 401(k)s being cut in half, and if you vote Democrat, that's what's going to happen. They want to erase our gains and plunge our country into a nightmare of gridlock, poverty, chaos and, frankly, crime, because that's what comes with it. So we're just five weeks away from one of the most important congressional elections in our lifetime."
00:02:23 - 00:02:58 (36 sec),"You see what's happening in Washington right now so you know how important it is. You see what's going on. By the way, look back there, look at all that media. Look at all that media. If we could ever get them on our side, we'd win for a thousand years -- for a thousand years. On Tuesday, November 6th, I need your vote, I need your support to stop radical Democrats and to elect proud Minnesota Republicans."
00:02:58 - 00:03:57 (59 sec),"And we have some great ones right now up for election. This week I announced another historic victory for our nation. We're replacing the job-killing disaster known as NAFTA... with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. It's called the USMCA. That works, right? USMCA. I didn't want to use NAFTA. That has been a disaster for our country: 50,000 plants and factories moving out, millions and millions of jobs lost, one of the worst trade deals ever."
00:03:57 - 00:04:23 (26 sec),"I actually know one that's worse, but I won't tell you, because we're going to be doing something with that too. But NAFTA's been one of the great disasters of all time and now we have a great and fair deal. We have a fair deal, and that's what we want. Great for our workers and really great for our farmers."
00:04:23 - 00:04:44 (21 sec),"It's about time. We're opening it up. The barriers are coming down. And this is tremendous for Minnesota. This is tremendous for Minnesota. And you've waited for a long time. And by the way, we've got plenty coming. You know what's going on with China? They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. But I say they're not ready yet."
00:04:44 - 00:05:08 (24 sec),"They want to make a deal, but I told them, ""You want to make a deal, but you're not ready yet, so we'll talk later."" We have secured landmark protections for the medical innovations being produced right here in your great state. You have great medical in your state. And we've removed unfair trade barriers for our proud Minnesota farmers and our dairy producers like has never, ever been done before in our country."
00:05:08 - 00:05:31 (23 sec),"America is winning again and America is being respected again all over the world right now, and we're going to keep it that way forever. It's called America first. [Audience Chants USA] You even have people sitting behind the flag. That's... It's OK. Great people. And by the way, you got thousands of people outside and you have thousands of people who I just saw in a lovely room, but I said, ""Next time, you have to get here a couple of days earlier."" Right?"
00:05:31 - 00:05:53 (22 sec),"The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. That's really it. Because you're winning. You're winning a lot. There's never been an administration that in already less than two years -- but can you believe we all did this together? We're coming up on two years, can you believe it? There has never been an administration, with you, that's done so much in so little time."
00:05:53 - 00:06:15 (22 sec),"Two years. No administration's come close. None has come close. And we've got a lot coming. If Democrats take over Congress, the stock market will plummet. They will -- it will plummet. You know, there's a reason for it. Every day we hit new highs, new highs. I think we had 103 new highs. Think of it. All time."
00:06:15 - 00:06:49 (34 sec),"That means jobs. To a lot of people, it means great 401(k)s. It means great -- but to a lot of people, it means jobs. It's jobs. Your 401(k)s will be devastated if Democrats take control and our political system will grind to a really messy halt. And you see what's going on in Congress right now with one of the most respected people, potentially, hopefully Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh."
00:06:49 - 00:07:38 (49 sec),"Man... [Audience Chants We Want Kavanaugh] What they're putting him through, and his family. His family is incredible. What they're putting them through. Democrats want to raise your taxes. They want to restore job-killing regulations. There's no administration ever that's cut as many regulations. And we have regulations."
00:07:38 - 00:08:12 (34 sec),"We want clean water. We want crystal, clear air. We want beautiful environment. We want. But you don't have to have regulation that makes it impossible for our country to compete with other countries, and that's what we're doing. The Democrats want to cripple law enforcement. They want to get rid of ICE. How about ICE? ICE, they're tough and they love our country, but you need tough ones."
00:08:12 - 00:08:35 (23 sec),They're tough. They love our country. They get rid of MS-13. They get rid of these gangs. You wouldn't believe it. They throw them the hell out or they bring them to jail. The Democrats embrace socialism. We're not going to be Venezuela -- you see what's happening -- and open our borders to deadly drugs and violent gangs.
00:08:35 - 00:08:57 (22 sec),"And I've said it and I'll say it as many times as you want to hear it, and it's because of their policy: The Democrats are truly the party of crime, because that's what happens. Open borders, that's what happens. And the Dems are willing to do anything to hurt anyone to get the power they so desperately crave."
00:08:57 - 00:09:13 (16 sec),"All they know is how to do -- you know what the words are -- they want to resist, they want to obstruct, they want to delay, demolish, they want to destroy. That's what happens. That's what happens. And just take a look at what's going on. Democrats have been trying to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh... since the very first second he was announced."
00:09:13 - 00:09:59 (46 sec),"And he was announced for one simple reason: He is an incredible intellect, an incredible person, an incredible talent. He's been an incredible judge. Because they know that Judge Kavanaugh will protect, uphold and defend the Constitution of The United States as written. But all you have to do is look at the polls over the last three or four days and it shows that their rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before."
00:09:59 - 00:10:21 (22 sec),"Nobody's ever seen it. Up 11, up 10, up 14. Nobody's ever seen this before. We love it. Do we love it? We love it. Because people see what's happening and they don't like it. The people of Minnesota and the people of America are going to reject the Democrat politics of anger and destruction, and they are going to vote to keep making America great again, greater than ever before."
00:10:21 - 00:10:47 (26 sec),"And in two years, they are going to vote to keep America great, right? Keep America great. We're almost at that point already, but I can't -- I love ""Make America Great,"" but I can't use it in two years. They'll say, ""What have you been doing?"" right? ""What have you been doing?"" Oh, boy, I tell you, it's been a while."
00:10:47 - 00:11:15 (27 sec),"We have had fun, right? We've had fun. This is -- and they don't even correct me when I say it. They don't even correct me. Fake news media. But this is... I mean, look at this stadium. Look, look. As an example, thousands of people in a room next door, thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in, this big stadium is packed, always."
00:11:15 - 00:11:45 (30 sec),"In all fairness to Minnesota, in Las Vegas, in Missouri. You know in Missouri... [Audience Member calls out] Thank you. I love you too, but you're not my type. No, but -- hey, Missouri. They had 44,000 people outside of a big arena. 44,000 people. Las Vegas. We went to -- West Virginia was incredible. West Virginia."
00:11:45 - 00:12:20 (35 sec),"Tennessee. Tennessee, and you see how far Tennessee went up over the last couple of days. It's incredible. Missouri, wow, have we done great. Josh, Josh. So we're thrilled to be joined by a number of your terrific Republican leaders and I just want to introduce somebody that's been such an incredible help to me in getting your tax cuts, I mean, not so bad."
00:12:20 - 00:13:01 (41 sec),How about this? How about this? The Dems want to raise your taxes. We want to lower your taxes. We don't want crime. Crime's OK for them. They want open borders. How the hell do we not win this thing in a landslide every time? How do you... They're for crime and high taxes. We're for low taxes and no crime.
00:13:01 - 00:13:24 (23 sec),"I don't know. Somehow I don't think I would have been a very good politician on the other side of this equation. But a man who really has been helping me a lot, he's a tremendous force in Washington, he's respected by everybody, Congressman Tom Emmer. Minnesota House Speaker Kurt Daudt. Thanks, Kurt. Your state's next attorney general, Doug Wardlow."
00:13:24 - 00:13:57 (32 sec),"Your next governor -- I hear he's doing very well -- Jeff Johnson. We're also joined by the next United States senator from Minnesota, Karin Housley. Karin. So, Karin is running against a far-left Democrat, Tina Smith, who nobody knows who the hell she is. Who is she? She was appointed. She took a wacky guy's place."
00:13:57 - 00:14:34 (38 sec),"That guy was -- he was wacky. Boy, did he fold up like a wet rag, huh? Man. Man, he was gone so fast. He was gone so fast. I don't want to mention Al Franken's name. OK? So I won't mention it. He was gone -- he was gone so fast. It was like, ""Oh, he did something, oh, oh, oh, I resign. I quit, I quit."" Wow. He was gone and he was replaced by somebody that nobody ever heard of. Her name is Tina Smith."
00:14:34 - 00:14:58 (23 sec),"Honestly, you know, I do this stuff for a living. I'm not sure I have ever heard of her [Inaudible]. The fact is, there's no reason for me to have heard of her, because she's never going to vote for us. She'll always vote for Schumer and Pelosi...and, of course, the legendary low-IQ Maxine Waters. Low-IQ person."
00:14:58 - 00:15:25 (27 sec),"She'll be with Schumer, do whatever he wants. ""What would you like me to do? Should I vote for higher taxes?"" ""Yes."" ""Oh, I want higher taxes. Should I vote against the wall?"" Which is happening, folks. She wants to vote against the wall. She voted against the wall. [Audience Chants Build that Wall] So we are building the wall."
00:15:25 - 00:15:52 (28 sec),"We started it. $1.6 billion. Now we got another $1.6 billion and we just got another. But I want to build it at one time, fast. But we're making a lot of progress on the wall. A lot of progress. I'd like to do it a lot faster. I'm good at building. And Tina voted for deadly sanctuary cities. Karin... Karin, do you promise you will not be voting for sanctuary cities, Karin?"
00:15:52 - 00:16:17 (24 sec),"OK. Good. She wants to keep crime out of Minnesota. That sounds like a good platform, right? Tina Smith would rather protect violent criminal aliens than loyal American citizens, which is why Tina Smith, that nobody ever heard of, needs to be voted out of office. She got appointed, I guess. And Tina Smith is voting against Judge Kavanaugh."
00:16:17 - 00:16:37 (20 sec),"Can you believe that one? So, he was number one at Yale, number one at Yale Law School. I think she's looking for a better student. [Laughter] Finally, I want to introduce two incredible -- by the way, Karin, come up, please, will you?"
00:16:37 - 00:17:12 (36 sec),"You really do go off script, don't you? Jeez. Thank you so much for telling everybody. And he said ""Tina Smith"" way too many times. We need to say ""Karin Housley"" a lot more. Thank you."
00:17:12 - 00:17:50 (38 sec),"Vote for her. Vote for Karin. Now for the people that we're here for. Congress is very important, and I'm here to support Congressman Jason Lewis, who you know. He's a friend of mine, who has worked so hard for us and so hard on your Second Amendment, which is under siege, and so hard on cutting your taxes and regulations."
00:17:50 - 00:18:01 (10 sec),"So, Jason, thank you. Come on up, Jason. And the next representative from Minnesota's 1st District, Jim Hagedorn. Come on up, fellas."
00:18:01 - 00:18:45 (44 sec),"Welcome to Minnesota, Mr. President. Now -- now, everybody in this room knows Minnesota loves President Trump. But I will tell you, in 2020, when he comes back here and takes this state, the whole world's going to know Minnesota loves President Trump. And you know what else Minnesota loves, Mr. President?"
00:18:45 - 00:19:18 (33 sec),"They love tax cuts that let you keep more of your money. Now, in the final analysis, that's really it, isn't it? I mean, growth is great, 4.5 percent growth, more job openings than job-seekers, after-tax income up 6 percent in one year. But in the final analysis, whose money is it? It's yours. You ought to have it. Minnesota loves manufacturing, mining and energy production in the 2nd District."
00:19:18 - 00:19:57 (40 sec),"Minnesota loves our farmers now, thanks to the president, who have free trade and fair trade. Right here in Rochester, Minnesota is very proud and loves health care; the kind of plan that you choose, not the plan that government bureaucrats choose for you. And that's why we repealed the Obamacare mandate and the president signed it into law."
00:19:57 - 00:20:41 (44 sec),"And -- and one more thing, Mr. President. Minnesota loves your judicial appointments. That's right. Minnesota loves your appointments to the lower courts, they love your appointments to the appellate courts, and Minnesota loves your appointments to the Supreme Court, including Judge Brett Kavanaugh. My friends, my friends, that's what's at stake in this election: due process, the presumption of innocence, the rule of law, private property, in other words, the Constitution of the United States."
00:20:41 - 00:21:08 (27 sec),"And if Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House, you can throw that all aside. But you know what? The radical resisters have to come through Minnesota first. And this is where it stops. I'm not going to let it happen, Jim Hagedorn isn't going to let it happen, and President Donald J. Trump is not going to let it happen."
00:21:08 - 00:21:09 (1 sec),Thank you all. On to November and let's win there.
00:21:09 - 00:22:23 (74 sec),"Thank you. Wow. Does Rochester, Minnesota, and southern Minnesota love this president? Absolutely. Boy, think back... Think back where we were just two years ago. Our nation's future was on the line. Had we not won that election, we would have lost the country the way the forefathers put it together. And by the grace of God, and we are grateful and proud, Mr. President, that [Inaudible], and thank you for what you're doing for our country."
00:22:23 - 00:23:16 (53 sec),We are. I just want to give the president a quick update on the Democrat Party here in Minnesota. They've moved far to the left like the rest of the Democrats across the country. We actually have a guy running for governor who wants to make Minnesota a sanctuary state. We have -- we have two people running for the United States Senate on the Democrat Party.
00:23:16 - 00:23:46 (31 sec),"They love late-term abortion and they believe in gun control. And we have all these congressional candidates, including the guy I'm running against, who think that we should have socialized medicine, single-payer. Does that make sense for the Mayo Clinic, Rochester? No, no. They want to resist. They want to replace."
00:23:46 - 00:24:12 (26 sec),"They want to take us back to Obama and then some. Are we going to let that happen? Heck no. No. Not going to let that happen. [Audience Responds No] Mr. President, we're going to work tirelessly. And because of your support and leadership and your endorsement, I want to go out to Washington and serve as a conservative reinforcement to partner with you to keep moving America in the right direction."
00:24:12 - 00:24:14 (1 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President."
00:24:14 - 00:24:44 (30 sec),"Wow. Wow. Good talent. So, Jason and Jim are both running against extreme Democrats. Jim's opponent, Dan Feehan... supports a total government takeover of health care, which drives your costs right through the roof and the health care is lousy, by the way. Oh, is that so? And he wants to make Minnesota into -- true -- a sanctuary for the criminal aliens and for gang members."
00:24:44 - 00:25:16 (32 sec),"That's the people -- they will come flooding up here as soon as you do it. It happens every time. Jason's opponent, Angie Craig... Who the hell is Angie Craig? -- also wants to take away your health care. And she refuses to support Enbridge Pipeline. You know all about that. That would bring more than 8,000 jobs to Minnesota."
00:25:16 - 00:25:43 (28 sec),"And you know we've really opened up Minnesota. You see what's going on with the mines and the miners and the ore. Worst of all, a vote for Dan Feehan and Angie Craig is a vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House. Can you imagine Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House? Don't do that to me. I didn't buy into that."
00:25:43 - 00:26:30 (47 sec),"Neither did you. If Democrats take charge, Maxine Waters will also... Now, listen to this one. She's going to take over Financial Services in Congress. Can you believe it? Maxine Waters. That's one of the most powerful committees in Congress. If you want to stop Pelosi from becoming speaker, if you want to stop Chuck Schumer from becoming majority leader... and if you want to stop the radical Democrats from running Congress, then you need to vote Republican."
00:26:30 - 00:26:58 (28 sec),You have to get out there on November 6th and vote Republican. You've got to get it -- and vote for these people. These are great people. A Democrat-controlled Congress would also pose a grave threat to Medicare. You know what they're doing with Medicare? They'll destroy it. The majority of House Democrats have cosponsored a socialist takeover of health care that would obliterate Medicare.
00:26:58 - 00:27:18 (20 sec),"Their plan is called Medicare for All, except they have no money. But it's really Medicare for none. Their plan would rob American seniors of the benefits they have paid -- and they've paid these benefits and they've paid so much money for their entire lives and you take it away. [Audience Member shouts] Thank you, darling."
00:27:18 - 00:27:59 (41 sec),"Love these people. These people are so great. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors, who have earned it and they've paid for it. And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We're going to take care of them. Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions and some people have -- you know what I say?"
00:27:59 - 00:28:30 (31 sec),"We'll get a little more money from China. It'll be just fine. OK? It'll be just fine. We'll be just fine. We're going to take care of pre-existing conditions, folks. Remember that. The lead sponsor of the Democrats -- think of this. The health care takeover, who is the lead sponsor? I've been reading so much about him."
00:28:30 - 00:28:51 (21 sec),"He did predict I was going to win, by the way. I will say that. That's the only thing he's gotten right in a long time. Keith Ellison. Did you know that? No, he did. That's right. He was on a show the day after I announced. On June 16th, I came down the stair with Melania -- who's right now in Africa, our first lady."
00:28:51 - 00:29:11 (20 sec),"She's doing a great job. Doing a great job for the people of Africa. Amazing. But Ellison was on a show the day after I announced and he looked at two people, the hosts, he said, ""You know he's going to win, don't you?"" And they smiled. One laughed. They spoke. They thought I was just doing this for fun."
00:29:11 - 00:29:41 (30 sec),"You think this is fun? You think this... This is a lot of work. It's a lot more work than anybody knew. And that's the last time he's been right, but I'm glad he was right about that. Ellison is the number two official in the entire Democrat Party and he recently marched in a parade wearing a shirt that read, ""I do not believe in borders."" Oh, that's wonderful."
00:29:41 - 00:30:20 (39 sec),"By the way, you don't have borders, you don't have a country, folks. You don't have a country. Keith Ellison's Democrat Party embraces radical socialism and open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. They want to unleash violent predators and ruthless killers -- and you know it. Somebody would say, ""Oh, gee, why is he saying that?"
00:30:20 - 00:30:46 (25 sec),"That's not"" -- it's true. Like MS-13, near our schools, near our families and into our communities. No good. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans proudly stand with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol and law enforcement, our police."
00:30:46 - 00:31:18 (33 sec),"Great people. They do an incredible job. My administration has also reformed our refugee program to protect American communities like you have in Minnesota, where you're being treated very unfairly, and to protect your families and your taxpayer dollars. If you want security, if you want a border, then what you have to do is immediately go out, think about it, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your workers."
00:31:18 - 00:31:39 (21 sec),"You've got to go November 6th, vote Republican. That'll do it. That'll do it. We need the votes. You know, I keep hearing we have a majority. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority. If somebody's not feeling great, we don't have a majority. It's like -- it's like the saying -- that's why we're getting the wall by hook, by crook, we're getting the wall, but it's so difficult."
00:31:39 - 00:32:07 (28 sec),"These guys want to stop it. They want to say -- you know, it's interesting. We've got $700 billion for the military, which is, you know, many, many, many times -- we've got $716 billion for the military. We are rebuilding our military. But to get money for the wall, their whole life is trying to obstruct the wall because they know we want it. But you know what?"
00:32:07 - 00:32:34 (27 sec),"It's not working. I'd like to do it a lot faster, but it's not working. We're getting the money. You think it's easy? Not easy. But we're getting it built and it's already going up in San Diego and lots of other places along the border. [Audience Chants Build that Wall] This election is about safety and it's about prosperity."
00:32:34 - 00:33:02 (27 sec),"Since the election, we have created over 4 million new jobs. The media will tell you there was no way we could have said that during the campaign. Nobody would have believed it. And we've lifted 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Think of that. You know, when you do that, you save a lot of money and you also make a lot of people really happy."
00:33:02 - 00:33:23 (22 sec),"When you think about it, right? We've added nearly a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, ""You need a magic wand. You'll never do that."" I said, ""What happens? We don't build anything anymore?"" And we have companies pouring into our country and they're coming to Minnesota. They're coming to a lot of states."
00:33:23 - 00:33:51 (28 sec),"But we have companies. They're all coming back. They want to be where the action is. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. The auto companies. I was with Prime Minister Abe two days ago. He said, ""Many of our auto companies are coming back."" I said, ""No, no, that's not good enough. All of them have to come back."
00:33:51 - 00:34:17 (26 sec),"All."" And he's going to do that. They're all coming back. They've already started. You look at Michigan, what's going on in Michigan, where they're coming back so fast -- but they're coming back to Ohio. They're coming back to Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina. And they're coming in to a place called Minnesota."
00:34:17 - 00:34:46 (29 sec),"Do we love Minnesota? 1972. You know what that is, right? That was the last time -- and boy, we came, like, this close. One more speech up here and I would have won this state. I came -- do you remember? I said, ""I think I'm going to win Minnesota,"" and everyone said, ""No, no, it hasn't been won since 1972."" Is that right? 19 -- right?"
00:34:46 - 00:35:20 (34 sec),"The Congress [Inaudible], right? Yeah. 1972. It hasn't been won. I said, ""No, look at the crowds. They love it. We're going to take care of Minnesota. We're going to stop what's happening that's so unfair in Minnesota."" And then on election night, I said, ""Let's go to Minnesota,"" but they already scheduled for a great place, a great state, Michigan."
00:35:20 - 00:35:40 (19 sec),"That's another one hadn't been won in many, many years. I went to Michigan. We had 32,000 people in Michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning. It was already Election Day. So I had to skip Minnesota. I felt so badly because one more speech -- I could have showed up at 3 o'clock in the morning maybe. I don't know."
00:35:40 - 00:36:08 (28 sec),"But we're going to win. We're going to win Minnesota. And you see that just by this crowd. Look at this crowd. This place is... So something I'm very proud of, African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. Think of those two sound bites."
00:36:08 - 00:36:39 (31 sec),"The lowest unemployment, the lowest rate of poverty. So think of this: How does your African-American, how do you vote for somebody else? I've done more for them in two years. African-Americans are coming up and they're saying, ""Mr. President, thank you. Thank you."" And their median income is the highest."
00:36:39 - 00:36:56 (17 sec),"But not only for African-Americans, for Asian, for Hispanic. Hispanic unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. Think of it. Asian unemployment, the lowest it's ever been. People with no high school diploma -- that's a very important group of people to me -- it is by far the lowest it's ever been. Women I'm failing with."
00:36:56 - 00:37:19 (22 sec),"I am failing with women. It's only the lowest in 65 years. Sorry. Sorry. I thought it would be history by now, because I've been saying African-American, I've been saying Hispanic, I've been saying Asian, I've been -- and women, it's only the lowest in 65 years. But I thought by now, it would be OK. [Audience member calls out] Got a lot of energy, this one over here."
00:37:19 - 00:38:03 (45 sec),"She's got a lot of energy. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Sixty-five years, not bad, but soon it's going to be in history, I predict. My administration has taken the toughest-ever action cracking down on China's trading abuses. We have to stop it. And we have a very good relationship with President Xi. I have a very good relationship."
00:38:03 - 00:38:42 (38 sec),"But we can't allow what's happened over so many years to continue happening. They've been taking $500 billion, with a B, out of our country and rebuilding China. And I said, ""We can't do that anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" For years, China has been draining us, taking our factories and building up their country with our money, and at the expense of our workers and our companies."
00:38:42 - 00:39:07 (25 sec),"And we're not going to have it. No more. And not only China. Many countries. Look, many countries. We defend countries that are very rich. They don't pay us or they pay us a small percentage. I mean, look, we get along great with these countries, but take Saudi Arabia. Would you say they have some money?"
00:39:07 - 00:39:48 (42 sec),"So we defend them and they pay a small percentage. I said, ""Excuse me, King Salman"" -- he's my friend -- ""do you mind paying for the military?"" ""Do you mind? Hey."" They're paying for 30 percent. I said, ""Do you mind paying?"" ""But nobody has asked me."" I said, ""But I'm asking you, King."" He says, ""Great."" He said, ""But are you serious?"" I said, ""No, I'm totally serious."
00:39:48 - 00:40:16 (28 sec),"Trust me."" [Laughter] And they'll do it. He said nobody's ever asked him. You're talking about -- by the way, you're talking about billions and billions of dollars. Japan, ""No, President Obama would never have asked. That's not his kind of thing. Not his thing."" Why would somebody ask to be paid back billions of dollars?"
00:40:16 - 00:41:00 (44 sec),"Japan, very rich, very great country. I told you, Prime Minister Abe, great man. Just won a fantastic election. Big results. I have an -- an incredible relationship. I said to him, ""Listen, we're defending you."" We're doing a great job. They were sending missiles over Japan from North Korea. Because of me, those missiles aren't going over Japan anymore."
00:41:00 - 00:41:24 (24 sec),"There are no more missiles, no more testing, no more nuclear. We got our hostages back. We got the remains of our great heroes back, right? The remains. The remains are coming back. That was the most beautiful ceremony. Did anybody see that ceremony a month ago? So beautiful. And the remains are coming back."
00:41:24 - 00:41:56 (31 sec),"And what do I get? I get the fake news saying, ""Why isn't he moving faster?"" I just left -- what? -- three months ago. I had a meeting in Singapore. I mean, this has been going on for 75 years -- now let's say 25 years with the missiles and the nuclear -- but no president's done anything. It's -- it's like, three months."
00:41:56 - 00:42:31 (35 sec),"And they'll say, the all-time great, ""What's taking so long?"" I said, ""It's been three months and you don't have rockets and you don't have missiles and you don't have nuclear testing and we get all of our"" -- I mean, it's crazy. But here's what they say. So, they can't get me. One of them actually said -- a nice guy, a friend of mine."
00:42:31 - 00:43:15 (44 sec),"He actually said, ""Why is the president giving so much to North Korea?"" I said, ""I haven't given anything. What have I given?"" I haven't paid -- I didn't pay $1.8 billion for the hostages like Obama did... with Iran, remember? $1.8 billion in cash. Gave them $150 billion. So I haven't given. But I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim. I have a very good relationship."
00:43:15 - 00:43:44 (29 sec),"So because of that relationship, let's see. I think we'll work something out. Maybe we won't. Who knows? It's a deal. Let's see. But so far -- so I'm -- when did I leave, like three months ago, three and a half months ago, maybe less? And they're saying, ""He agreed to meet,"" because they -- I didn't give -- so you know what I gave them?"
00:43:44 - 00:44:29 (45 sec),"I agreed to meet. That's what they say. I agreed to meet. Is that a big deal? I agreed to meet. I asked the Democrats before -- you know, we were close to a war with North Korea, I'll you what. And my rhetoric was very tough at the beginning. It was really, really tough. In fact, they all said I'm going to cause a war with North Korea."
00:44:29 - 00:44:49 (21 sec),"I'm going to cause a war. And then with Putin of Russia, they said, ""He was too nice."" He was -- that was a great meeting. We had a very successful -- so they want me to get into a boxing match with him. I think I'd do very well. But with Russia... [Audience Chants USA] No, no. It's the fake news. Fake news."
00:44:49 - 00:45:08 (19 sec),"They said with Russia, ""He was too nice. He was too nice."" With North Korea, they said, ""He was too tough. He was too tough."" And let me tell you, if I was really rough with Russia, they'd say, ""He was too tough. He was too tough."" These people are loco, I'm telling you. Loco. [Laughter] People are crazy."
00:45:08 - 00:45:33 (24 sec),"Fake news. The fake news, everybody. They are fake. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation, right? To give our workers and businesses a level playing field, Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. Better vote for Karin."
00:45:33 - 00:45:57 (25 sec),"They want to take them away. They want to take them away. We've taken historic action to make health care more affordable and we've gotten rid of the soaring premiums. You know, the premiums on Obamacare -- nobody realized it. They were going up 116 percent, 138 percent, 200 percent. Through great management and great people, we've kept them down."
00:45:57 - 00:46:25 (27 sec),"We've mostly obliterated Obamacare, although we had it won except for 2 o'clock in the morning -- I say it again -- 2 o'clock in the morning and I was like -- I'm not going to do it. Two o'clock in the morning. But think of it differently: We didn't get one Democrat vote so we're stuck with it, but it's obliterated."
00:46:25 - 00:46:56 (31 sec),"And the big thing is, we got rid of the most unpopular part of Obamacare. It's called the individual mandate, where you have the privilege of paying a fortune so that you don't have to pay a fortune for horrible health care, right? So, the premiums in Minnesota this year are coming down by double digits."
00:46:56 - 00:47:31 (35 sec),"Think of that. And I don't even like this stuff, but while we have the remnants of Obamacare, we're working to make it much more affordable than you had. And to reduce drug prices, the FDA has approved a record number of affordable generic medicines. And that's not all. Drug prices are coming down. You might have seen last month where I called up some of the drug companies."
00:47:31 - 00:48:09 (37 sec),"I said, ""Folks, you just raised up the drug prices. You can't do that."" And they all reduced them. Do you believe it? That's when I said, ""I've a lot of power."" Pfizer, right? You saw that. Pfizer, Novartis, they raised their drug prices and I'm bringing them down. I said, ""What are you doing with raising them?"" ""I'm sorry, Mr. President, we'll reduce them immediately."" I said, ""Man, this is a powerful position."
00:48:09 - 00:48:51 (43 sec),"I never..."" First time in the history of drug companies that they've done that. They literally announced it. I called them the next day. I told them I was extremely unhappy and they said, ""We're going to reduce it."" Who the hell does that? Do you think Hillary Clinton would have done that? [Audience Responds No] I don't think so. I don't think so. [Audience Chants Lock her up] By the way, she or whoever it might have been, crazy Bernie, whoever they put in, they wouldn't have done any of the things -- we did the greatest trade deal."
00:48:51 - 00:49:15 (23 sec),"Look at the money. We did 4.2 percent GDP. They were going down. They would have had a minus four point. They -- they said 4.2 percent is impossible. It's going to go higher, much higher. We have such potential. Between military and trade deals, we have hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fat and potential."
00:49:15 - 00:49:37 (22 sec),"And what I love -- what I love, hopefully you don't need it for a long time or never, to help critically ill patients get life-saving treatments, we passed Right to Try. I love it. I hope you don't need it. I hope I don't need it, too. I hope you don't need it. But that's -- you know, we have the greatest -- frankly, the greatest drug companies in the world."
00:49:37 - 00:50:27 (50 sec),"And we would have drugs that would take four or five years -- you know, we've brought it down from 14 years to get approved down to four. I think we'll be at three or two. But still, you've got to wait a long time. And a person who is dying, a person is terminally ill and they have a great, you know, possible cure, and so a person wants to see if they could possibly -- you couldn't get it. There was no way of getting it. No way in a million years."
00:50:27 - 00:51:09 (42 sec),"I worked with Congress, including these guys and... and Greg. And Greg, right? And Jim and Mark and the whole group. But we worked with Congress and we got it done. I love the name, Right to Try. Now, they can go, they sign a paper. You have no idea: They've been trying to get this for 40 years. You know, who would think?"
00:51:09 - 00:52:12 (63 sec),"They've been trying for 40 years. And it is, you have problems with insurance companies. You have problems with trials. You have problems with so many different things. You have problems with everything. Everything is there -- and you have problems with liability. I said, ""Sign a document that there's no liability."" They don't want to give something, the person dies and then the family sues the country."
00:52:12 - 00:52:39 (27 sec),"That's no good. So you sign away your rights if you take it. And you know what happened? Everybody said, ""Wow, that's a good idea."" Can you believe this? So after 40 years, we have it. And now people are trying it. And you know what? We've had some incredible results. And it's also telling you whether or not this stuff works."
00:52:39 - 00:53:00 (21 sec),"There's something good about that, too. We've had some incredible results, right? I love it. People would fly to other continents, they'd fly to other countries. If they were poor they'd just go away. They'd had no hope. They'd go to their house or their apartment and they'd have no hope. Now, they have hope."
00:53:00 - 00:53:38 (38 sec),"It's beautiful. It's so great. We also passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor... see a private doctor instead of waiting in line. I mean, we had people waiting for three weeks, two weeks, 12 days, nine weeks. We had people that were not very sick. It took them so long to see the private doctor, to see a doctor, a veterans doctor -- and they're good doctors."
00:53:38 - 00:54:07 (30 sec),"We really do, we have great doctors -- but it's a long process. So they're not very sick. By the time they'd see the doctor 22 days later, they'd be terminally ill. Think of it. They would die. They would die on line waiting. They now have the right to go to a private doctor and we pay the bill. Forty-four years they've been trying to get it. I thought that was my idea."
00:54:07 - 00:54:40 (33 sec),"I came back, ""I got the greatest idea."" I said to all my medical people, ""I got the greatest idea. It's taken too long. We could never solve this problem. Too many people, too few doctors. They're great doctors, but you can't get to them. I got the greatest -- we're going to have the people go to a private doctor and we're going to pay for it."" And they said, ""Sir, we've been working on this for 44 years."" But I got it approved because I'm good at getting things approved, right?"
00:54:40 - 00:55:04 (24 sec),"Right? All done. All done. And these people helped me. Right there. They helped me with it. Right there. And we also passed landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable. We say, ""Jim, you're fired. Out. Get out. Get out."" We had no right to do it. Between the unions and the civil servants, they could do anything."
00:55:04 - 00:55:27 (23 sec),"They could be sadists -- and they were. They were sadists. These are sick people. They -- they could be sadists. They could be stealing. They could be robbing you blind. They could be doing anything. You couldn't fire them. They were totally protected. Now, you just fire them. Get them out. We have secured a record $716 billion to rebuild our military and give our brave warriors their largest pay raise in a decade."
00:55:27 - 00:56:03 (36 sec),"And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working -- I'm so excited about this -- to create the sixth branch, number six, of the American armed forces, called the Space Force. We have the Air Force. Now we have the Space Force. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear disaster deal."
00:56:03 - 00:56:34 (31 sec),"And we've opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Presidents have been promising that for many, many decades and I finally know why, because I was hit so hard when they heard I was going to do it. I got calls from every country in the world. ""Please, don't do it."" And I told you the story. I said, ""Look, I don't want to take any calls from any leaders of any countries."
00:56:34 - 00:56:52 (18 sec),"Tell them I'll call them back."" We were going to have it signed on a Monday. Big ceremony. I said, ""Tell them I'll call them back next week."" [Laughter] Because they were calling me and they were saying, ""Mr. President, please don't do that. Please. Please."" So I know why Obama and Bush and everybody didn't do it. I mean, I understand."
00:56:52 - 00:57:27 (35 sec),"There was a lot of pressure put on them. So I just said, ""Tell them I'll call them back next week."" So on Monday I signed it, and then on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday I called everybody back. ""Hi, how are you doing? What's up?"" [Laughter] ""Well, we didn't want you to do..."" I said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. Gee, it's too late."" I said, ""What can I do? What can I do?"" ""What can I do?"" For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
00:57:27 - 00:58:28 (61 sec),"Now you have a president who is standing up for America... more than ever before. [Audience Chants USA] We're standing up for your values, we're standing up for Minnesota and we are standing proudly for our national anthem. All right. I'll give you a quick story that they don't know. They've never heard."
00:58:28 - 00:58:47 (19 sec),"It's hard to believe; I thought they knew everything about me. So in making the deal with Mexico and then Canada, -- as you know, Canada was very tough, but that they worked out fine. And the NFL -- because we talk about the flag and the -- I'm not happy about it with the NFL. OK? I'm not happy, if it's OK with you guys -- is it OK with you?"
00:58:47 - 00:59:16 (30 sec),"Not happy. People should stand proudly for our national anthem and for our flag. So I'm not happy. I'm not happy. But that seems to be working out. Do you notice? That's seems to be working out very good. But to show you -- so we're making the deal with Canada. And it's big stuff. You know, it's cars and it's farming and it's agriculture and it's factories and it's big, big dollars."
00:59:16 - 00:59:38 (22 sec),"Tremendous. They say it's the largest trade deal ever made, $1.3 trillion. But I heard that the NFL had a big problem with Canada on their advertising, on the commercials. A big, big problem. I'm not going to get into what it was, but it was a very bad problem and it went on for years and it was really hurting the NFL. Now, I don't care."
00:59:38 - 00:59:53 (15 sec),"I like some of the people. I don't like some of the -- it doesn't matter. It's an American company. It's a great American company. So during the negotiation I said, ""You've got to fix the NFL problem."" They said, ""What?"" I said, ""You've got to fix the NFL problem."" Took me two minutes and now the NFL is so happy it's all worked out."
00:59:53 - 01:00:15 (21 sec),It's all worked out. They don't know that. It's all worked out. We've got to fix it. And now our country will be taking tens of millions of dollars more money. It's going to go -- a lot of it's going to go to the players and they'll still hate me. Can you believe it? But you know what? Think of it. It took me two minutes.
01:00:15 - 01:00:39 (24 sec),"You've got to fix the problem. It's because -- not because I love them or don't like them. I do like them. It's a great American company. I said, ""You've got to fix the NFL problem. It's unfair what you do to them during the Super Bowls. Very unfair."" And I got a call from Roger Goodell. No, very nice. And I figured he was calling about the flag."
01:00:39 - 01:01:05 (27 sec),"Like, to say, ""Could you leave us alone, please?"" [Laughter] And he wasn't. He said, ""Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for what you did. You solved a problem that was going on for years."" The Obama administration couldn't do it. Nobody could do it. Nobody could get it done. I did it in two minutes. It was like, ""You've got to do it. We've got to do it."" It was a tiny, little part of the deal."
01:01:05 - 01:01:26 (20 sec),"I figured, ""What the hell? It was like two sentences."" But it was very nice. Roger Goodell called me and then Bob Kraft, who owns -- who's a great owner. Now, it's great to have Coach Belichick and Tom Brady, that's a good thing, right? I always say, ""Bob, you're a great owner and you're one of the luckiest men on Earth."
01:01:26 - 01:01:41 (16 sec),"You took Tom Brady in the sixth round, right? And you have the greatest coach in football."" That's a good thing and he's a great guy. But he called me to thank me and Roger Goodell called to thank me. Very nice. And we're all friends. I want what's good for the country. People said to me... True. One of my killers called up. We have very tough negotiators, very smart guys."
01:01:41 - 01:01:55 (14 sec),"We have, like, the A Team of the world. And he said, ""You know, we could have that -- that NFL thing. I heard about it for years."" Everybody heard about it, what they were doing. I said -- I said -- they said, ""You know, I think we could fix that NFL deal for you."" I said, ""Let's fix it."" They said, ""Really?"
01:01:55 - 01:02:16 (21 sec),"You want to do that?"" I said, ""No. They're a great American company. They're going to pay tax on that money. They're going to pay the money to people that work and live in our country. Fix the deal."" They were surprised. I said, ""Fix it."" They fixed it and it was a nice thing. OK, enough of that. That's enough of that."
01:02:16 - 01:02:32 (16 sec),"True. So the NFL, good company, great, great people. We're lifting millions of our citizens -- and you know this -- from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And a lot of people are coming out of prisons and they're able to get jobs now."
01:02:32 - 01:02:53 (21 sec),"Isn't that great? They're getting a second chance and even a third chance and they're getting jobs. And people that are hiring many of these prisoners are saying unbelievable how good they are. It's so beautiful to see. And before, they wouldn't have a chance. People didn't want to hire them. They're hiring people coming out of prison and these people are stepping up. I have a friend that hired many, quite a few, and he said, ""I can't say every one,"" but he said, ""These people are unbelievable."
01:02:53 - 01:03:18 (25 sec),"They're so hard-working. We've given them a second chance."" It's a -- to me, it's a beautiful thing. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends and get your family and get your neighbors and your coworkers and get out, and you have to -- November 6th, you have to go out and vote Republican."
01:03:18 - 01:03:56 (39 sec),"Send Jason Lewis and Jim Hagedorn to the House. And vote to send Karin Housley... Get Karin Housley into the Senate. We need her. We need her vote. We need her. She's going to be fantastic. Forget about Tina. Karin, they're going to get you in. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation and more products made right here in the good old USA. That's what we want."
01:03:56 - 01:04:29 (33 sec),"It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and to love and respect the heroes of law enforcement. Great. They're great. They're great people. No easy job. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division and destruction -- it's destruction -- and to unite together as citizens, as patriots and as Americans."
01:04:29 - 01:05:06 (37 sec),"To everyone in this beautiful, big, rich room, to every citizen watching across our land, this is your time to choose. It's a time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past, or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. It's not up to the media or to the pundits to decide your fate."
01:05:06 - 01:05:38 (32 sec),"It's up to you. This was the greatest movement, 2016, all of those hats, Make America Great Again. Look at them. Amazing. Amazing. It's the greatest movement in the history of our country. It is. I mean, there's never been a movement like this. There's never been a movement like this. As an example, the presidential election is not for two and a half years."
01:05:38 - 01:06:05 (27 sec),"Look at this room. Look at this. Look outside. This is not a normal situation. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country and they know it. And they don't even challenge me when I say it, because if I was wrong, there would be headlines. ""Donald Trump..."" [Laughter] It's up to the proud people of our country and the very proud people of Minnesota, a great state."
01:06:05 - 01:06:49 (44 sec),"You have the power with your votes to defend America's honor and reclaim America's future. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. Together, we are taking back our country, returning power to the American people. This state was settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women... who braved the wilderness to build a life and to build a home."
01:06:49 - 01:07:27 (38 sec),"They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country and they loved their god. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to tear down their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage."
01:07:27 - 01:07:59 (32 sec),"For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory."
01:07:59 - 01:09:19 (80 sec),"Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together we will make America wealthy again... make America strong again... we will make America safe again... and we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:01:05 (65 sec),"Hello, Mississippi, hello. Beautiful. [Audience Chants USA] Well, I have to start by saying that 2020 is looking really easy, isn't it? I think the fake news media back there is starting to get it, folks. I think they're starting. They're starting to understand what's going on. And I'm thrilled to be back in this great state, with thousands of proud, loyal, hard-working American patriots."
00:01:05 - 00:01:41 (36 sec),"Thank you. In less than two years, we've achieved the biggest comeback in American history. That's what's happened. The economy is booming. Wages are rising. And more Americans are working today than ever before. Today -- ever before. Think of it. Now, just think of that. Today, we have more Americans working than we've ever had in the history of our country, right now, today."
00:01:41 - 00:02:20 (39 sec),"How great is that, right? We're defending our Second Amendment, protecting religious liberty, taking care of our great veterans... and rebuilding America's military like it hasn't been rebuilt ever before. This week, we made history again when I announced that we are replacing the job-killed disaster known as NAFTA with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement."
00:02:20 - 00:03:16 (56 sec),"A good one. And it's a good one. We're calling it USMCA. You're going to like that name. That'll become a part of your vocabulary. USMCA. Companies aren't going to be leaving us anymore and firing everybody and sending their product back into the United States with no tax. That was what I wanted. You know, Mississippi, when they leave and they go next door and they fire everybody and they build the product and send it back and sell it to the same people that were buying it before -- no, we don't want to do that anymore."
00:03:16 - 00:03:47 (31 sec),"No we don't want to do that anymore. It's not a good -- that's not a good thing to do. Although there is a group called globalists. They think it's just fine. Not fine. They're globalists. [Inaudible] globalists. We don't like the thinking of the globalists. The USMCA is an incredible victory for our farmers, our ranchers, our factory workers, and our entire nation."
00:03:47 - 00:04:20 (33 sec),"America is winning again, and America is being respected again, maybe respected like never before, because we are finally putting America first. But exactly five weeks from today, all of this extraordinary progress is at stake. It is at stake. I'm not on the ballot, but in a certain way, I'm on the ballot, so please go out and vote."
00:04:20 - 00:04:57 (37 sec),"Go out and vote. On November 6th, you will head to the polls -- hopefully -- in one of the most important congressional elections of our lifetime. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. A Democrat takeover of Congress will plunge our country into gridlock and chaos like you haven't seen before."
00:04:57 - 00:05:25 (28 sec),"It'll come to a halt. And I have to tell you, all of those people, with your savings accounts and your money piled up in your bank, it's all -- a lot of it's going to disappear, and it'll disappear really fast. Your 401(k)s -- I stand up all the time with great Americans. ""Sir, I'd like to thank you. My wife thinks I'm one of the greatest investors in the world."
00:05:25 - 00:06:05 (40 sec),"And two years ago, she thought I was a total loser, sir. Now she loves me so much."" ""Because my 401(k)..."" ""... has gone up 55 percent, sir, since you got elected! 55 percent!"" Ah, it's amazing. You can really get your wife to like you a lot when that happens. You've got to be really bad. I'll tell you. And that's happening."
00:06:05 - 00:06:33 (28 sec),"And it goes the other way, too. That happens. People are geniuses now. And we've helped. You know, we had probably -- and even the fake news would tell you -- the greatest victory in the history of this country in 2016. There's never been anything like that. The people came from the hills and the valleys."
00:06:33 - 00:07:05 (32 sec),"They came from all over. And they voted, voted, voted. And they love Trump, and they loved us. Because it wasn't me, it was all of us. It was all of us. And that's what's happening. That's what's happening. But it's all fragile. The Democrats will open our borders to deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The Democrats -- and I say this -- and I've dealt with it -- the Democrats are the party of crime."
00:07:05 - 00:07:41 (36 sec),"And that's what it is, they're the party of crime. Radical Democrats want to tear down our laws, tear down our institutions in pursuit of power, demolish our prosperity in the name of socialism and probably worse... and abolish our borders in the service of globalism. There is nothing Democrats aren't willing to do, and you're seeing it day by day, and you've seen it more the last week than you've ever seen it before."
00:07:41 - 00:08:07 (26 sec),"And no one -- just think of this. No one under any circumstances is allowed to speak up if you're on this side of the equation. But guess what? We're speaking up like nobody has ever spoken up before. They want to get the power that they so desperately crave that was taken away from them. All of the Democrats know and all they really know how to do is obstruct, resist, demolish, destroy and delay."
00:08:07 - 00:08:25 (17 sec),"They've been trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced... because they know Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written. [Audience Chants We Want Kavanaugh] You know, for 10 years, I don't know him, I never met him, but I'd been hearing there's this guy named Brett Kavanaugh who is... who is like a perfect person, who is destined for the Supreme Court."
00:08:25 - 00:09:03 (39 sec),"I've heard that for a long time. And -- a lot of smart people. And first in his class at Yale. Top, top in his class at Yale Law School. He'd led, like, a life that's unbelievable. He's had no problems. They've never taken him out of restaurants. They've never -- this is like a person that everybody thought at the highest level on both sides, they said, ""Someday he will be a Supreme Court judge."" Right?"
00:09:03 - 00:09:40 (36 sec),"He will be a justice of the Supreme Court. And all my life, I've heard that the most important thing that a president has to do as president is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice and... And I disagree. I think war. I think our military. I think peace. I think those things are -- you know, those things are pretty important, right?"
00:09:40 - 00:10:02 (22 sec),"That's pretty important. They don't say that, but I say those things are pretty important. But I'll have to tell you, the appointment of a Supreme Court justice -- and I look at him, and I looked at the man that we appointed just before him, Justice Neil Gorsuch... who was put through the paces, but nothing like what's happening now."
00:10:02 - 00:10:31 (29 sec),"It's just crazed. It's crazy. What's happening now, they had gang rape. A gang rape. Many times. Well, that turned out to be false. So many different charges. Guilty until proven innocent. That's very dangerous for our country. That's very dangerous for our country. And I have it myself all the time. But for me, it's like a part of the job description."
00:10:31 - 00:11:18 (47 sec),"[Laughter] Let it happen to me. Shouldn't happen to him. Shouldn't happen to him. What he's going through: 36 years ago, this happened. ""I had one beer."" Right? ""I had one beer."" ""Well, you think it was..."" ""Nope, it was one beer."" ""Oh, good. How did you get home?"" ""I don't remember."" ""How did you get there?"" ""I don't remember."" ""Where is the place?"" ""I don't remember."" ""How many years ago was it?"" ""I don't know."
00:11:18 - 00:11:44 (26 sec),"I don't know. I don't know."" ""I don't know."" ""What neighborhood was it in?"" ""I don't know."" ""Where's the house?"" ""I don't know."" ""Upstairs, downstairs, where was it?"" ""I don't know. But I had one beer, that's the only thing I remember."" And a man's life is in tatters. A man's life is shattered. His wife is shattered."
00:11:44 - 00:12:15 (31 sec),"His daughters, who are beautiful, incredible young kids -- they destroy people. They want to destroy people. These are really evil people. And then you see... And then you see the people that are doing it. I know every one. I could tell you things about every one of them. Da Nang Richard Blumenthal. This guy lied about his service."
00:12:15 - 00:12:36 (20 sec),"He didn't just say, ""Gee, I was in the service."" No. He said, ""I was in the Marines. Da Nang Province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill."" This went on for 15 years when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. I thought he was a great war hero. And then it turned out he was never in Vietnam."
00:12:36 - 00:13:13 (38 sec),"He was in the Reserves! And I watched him two days ago. I watched him saying, ""We need the truth. If we don't have"" -- and here's a guy who was saying people were dying all around him and he was never there. And then he cried. When they caught him, he cried like a baby. [Laughter] Like a baby. When Jimmy Swaggart cried, it was nothing compared to Da Nang Richard."
00:13:13 - 00:13:47 (34 sec),"Nothing. Jimmy Swaggart was nothing compared to -- he cried, ""Oh, oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so"" -- he only lied for 15 years. And now we get something. And now he talks about lying. And this man's not lying. So Blumenthal is a fraud. He's a fraud. And the reason he got elected is because in Connecticut it's impossible for a Republican to get elected."
00:13:47 - 00:14:22 (35 sec),"And I did well there. But you can't. He actually gave up the race. You'd thought he lost. You remember that? He, sort of, gave -- he stopped campaigning. It was over. And then he won by three points. And we have him in the Senate. And now he's this great honorable guy, because you know why? The fake news doesn't ever want to put that stuff on. They don't want to talk about it. They don't ever want to put it on. They're a bunch of fakers."
00:14:22 - 00:14:53 (31 sec),"And then you have Cory Booker, right? Cory Booker. Here's a guy who destroyed practically by himself the city of Newark, New Jersey. He was such a bad mayor. And see what he wrote himself about women. Check it out, folks. Check it out. Then he talks -- ""How dare you treat a woman like that."" Take a look at what this guy wrote."
00:14:53 - 00:15:35 (42 sec),"And I know about every one of them. I could go on and on. How about Feinstein? How about her? ""We need more time for the FBI. The FBI has to do a more thorough search. We had another woman just reported by a sleazebag lawyer named Avenatti."" Sleazebag. Sleazebag. We have -- well, it turned out even NBC, who's as bad as they get -- even NBC couldn't shield her with that interview."
00:15:35 - 00:16:11 (36 sec),"Did you see that interview? This woman had no clue what was going on. No clue. And yet she made the most horrible charges against a number one in his class at Yale, perfect human being, great father, great husband. This is a great person. And people are saying, ""Well, maybe it's true. And because of the fact that maybe it's true he should not become a United States Supreme Court justice."" How horrible is this?"
00:16:11 - 00:16:41 (30 sec),"How horrible is this? So this is an important time for our country. This is a time when your father, when your husband, when your brother, when your son could do great. ""Mom, I did great in school. I've worked so hard. Mom, I'm so pleased to tell you, I just got a fantastic job with IBM. I just got a fantastic job with General Motors."
00:16:41 - 00:17:13 (32 sec),"I just got -- I'm so proud."" ""Mom, a terrible thing just happened. A person who I've never met said that I did things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job, Mom. I don't know what to do. Mom, what do I do? What do I do, Mom? What do I do, Mom?"" It's a damn sad situation, OK? But we better start as a country getting smart and getting tough and not letting that stuff right back there, all those cameras, tell us how to live our lives."
00:17:13 - 00:17:50 (36 sec),"Because they are really dishonest people. Not all of them, but damn well most of them. That I can tell you. Fake news. So that's something to think about, right? That's something -- think of your son. Think of your husband. Think -- I've had many false accusations. I've had it all the -- I've had so many -- and when I say it didn't happen, nobody believes me. But it's me. It's my job description."
00:17:50 - 00:18:26 (36 sec),"Mr. Trump, it's OK, you can say whatever you want. They can say whatever they want about me. It's fine, because we have the worst libel laws anywhere in the world. They can say anything they want, and we can't sue them, because if you're famous, you can't sue. Figure that one out. But to take people that are just outstanding and have had great lives, and that life doesn't mean a thing."
00:18:26 - 00:18:50 (24 sec),"And do you notice with the judge, they don't talk about his last 35 years? They don't talk about what -- everybody knows him. He's a very well-known and most highly respected person until the last couple of weeks, because they're destroying him and they're destroying his reputation. And we can't let that happen."
00:18:50 - 00:19:08 (18 sec),"We can't. Can't let it happen. And I don't even know him, folks. I don't even know him. I met him for the first time a few weeks ago. I don't even know him. So it's not like, ""Oh, gee, I want to protect my friend."" I want to do what's right for this country. This is a very important time in our country... OK? Very important thing."
00:19:08 - 00:19:54 (46 sec),"Very important time in our country. The Democrat Party has become too extreme -- this is an example of it -- and too dangerous to be trusted with power. That is why you must vote Republican on Election Day, and you have to go out and vote. You know, I'm listening to commentators, and they say, ""If Trump were running, he's going to beat everybody."" They're saying that."
00:19:54 - 00:20:24 (31 sec),"You know, it's hard for them to admit that. And I certainly dream about all these people. Biden, the guy never had more than 1 percent in a poll when he was running for president, and then Obama took him off the trash heap, right? Biden -- I hear Biden wants to take me to the back of a barn. He would be in big trouble, I will tell you."
00:20:24 - 00:21:02 (38 sec),"Remember he said that? ""I'd like to take him."" You know, with Biden, you go like this -- whew -- and he goes down. [Laughter] Biden. And the other ones. But they say that, ""Donald Trump isn't running, so will the people go out and vote in three weeks?"" You got to go out and vote. And they say, ""But Donald Trump doesn't like Congress."" I really do. I like a lot of the people in Congress."
00:21:02 - 00:21:27 (25 sec),"Some I'm disappointed in, but for the most part -- and I have to tell you something: We have the right ideas. We're making our country great again. We're doing the right thing. We need more Republican votes. They say we have a majority. We barely have -- if somebody has a cold and stays home, we don't have a majority."
00:21:27 - 00:21:49 (22 sec),"That's how bad it is. Republicans have to go out and vote. And they say if I was on the ticket, everybody would go, it would be a landslide. Even the fakers back there, they say that. And I'm not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket. Because this is also a referendum about me and the disgusting gridlock that they'll put this country through."
00:21:49 - 00:22:20 (31 sec),"Think of it. We have the greatest economy in history. We have a military that will soon be the strongest we've ever had. Our country is doing so well. And then we have a Maxine Waters saying, ""We have to get rid of him. We have to get rid of him!"" Maxine Waters. And Nancy Pelosi. She's another beauty. Get out and vote!"
00:22:20 - 00:22:49 (29 sec),"I want you to vote. Pretend I'm on the ballot. And don't worry, we'll be on the ballot in two years, and we will do a landslide like you haven't -- like you wouldn't believe. A couple of the reporters I see back there, they said, ""Oh, Trump is running."" And I must say, one of them said, right after I announced, June 16th -- right after I announced, there was a Sunday morning show."
00:22:49 - 00:23:14 (24 sec),"And one of them said, ""You know he's going to win, don't you?"" And another one, who's back there now, who's looking very well, said, along with the host, ""Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, you're only kidding. He's just doing this for fun."" You think this is fun? Yeah, actually, it's sort of fun. I guess it is. For me, it's fun."
00:23:14 - 00:23:47 (33 sec),"For me, it's fun. You know why it's fun? Because we're achieving our goals better than anyone thought possible. That's why it's fun. If I wasn't, it wouldn't be fun. But this one particular reporter, she said, ""Ho, ho, ho, you're only kidding, right? Ha, ha, that's so funny."" And I'll never forget on election night, ""Donald Trump is your next president, folks."" And it's driving them crazy."
00:23:47 - 00:24:13 (27 sec),"So, we're thrilled to be here tonight, and I am having a lot of fun. But it is true: I'm having fun because nobody ever would have believed in a million years that we would have accomplished what we've accomplished. Nobody has accomplished more in two years. You take a look at the first two years of any -- nobody has even come close to accomplishing what we've accomplished."
00:24:13 - 00:24:29 (16 sec),"And I'm doing it for you, and we're doing it together, because this is a whole thing that has never happened in our country before. You know, it's interesting, when we first started, there were a lot of people who were showing up. And by the way, you think this is a big crowd in here? This place is packed, right?"
00:24:29 - 00:25:13 (44 sec),"Right? And if there was one empty seat, they would say, as the Washington Post did say -- the Washington Post came -- you saw that, right? -- came to an arena someplace four hours early and they hadn't started letting the people in yet. And he put a picture of an empty arena. There were tens of thousands of people outside waiting to come in. The Washington Post put a picture of an empty arena, and they put a caption to the effect, ""Mr. President, not a very good crowd, is it?"" And you know what happened?"
00:25:13 - 00:25:40 (27 sec),"And they had a picture up of an empty arena like I was a -- I didn't even land for four and a half hours later. And when I landed, that place was just like this. It was packed with thousands of people outside. Now, did they fire that reporter? No. Did they fire that reporter? No. Right? They -- isn't it incredible?"
00:25:40 - 00:26:17 (37 sec),"Isn't it sad? And look what happened to Roseanne. Did they fire Roseanne? Yes. No, but think of it. Puts a picture of an empty -- like it had 5 percent. People were just starting to trickle in. And said, ""Not a very good crowd, Mr. President."" There was no games. You know what happened that night? People that were sitting on stairwells, people that couldn't get a seat, people that were here only cause the fire marshals were so incredible, that shouldn't have even been allowed to come in, with thousands outside, they said, ""This is a fraud by the Washington Post."" I was there."
00:26:17 - 00:26:37 (19 sec),"There were no empty seats. We set a record that evening for crowd attendance. Because we don't need much of a stage. Basketball, they need a big -- you're filled up with people, like it is tonight. And we barely got an apology. And he admitted he was wrong. You know where he did it? On his little Twitter account."
00:26:37 - 00:27:03 (27 sec),"[Laughter] And that kind of dishonesty happens all the time. Happened at the inauguration. It happened at the inauguration. It happens all the time. These are very, very dishonest people. We are thrilled to be joined tonight by several great Republican leaders. And we're going to start with a friend of mine who is a very special man, very special."
00:27:03 - 00:27:36 (33 sec),"He's a great governor. Done a fantastic job. He called me. He built the African-American Museum. Called me. We went there. It was so beautiful. We had -- I was at the opening. We cut the ribbon! Governor Phil Bryant. Governor. Thank you, Phil. Thank you, Phil. Should we bring Phil up here? He's been so -- come on. Get up here, Phil."
00:27:36 - 00:28:02 (26 sec),"Come, come, come. Come on, Phil, get up here. What a great governor he's been. Look at this guy. Is he central casting or what? Is he -- look at this. He's central casting. But you know where he's really good? His heart and his brain. Great brain and great heart. Seriously."
00:28:02 - 00:28:53 (51 sec),"Thank you! Are we proud to have Donald J. Trump here in Mississippi? All right, I don't want to get started, but I can tell you what. This man has done more as president of the United States in two years than any president that I can ever remember or ever studied about. He is a remarkable man that is making America great again! [Audience Chants USA]"
00:28:53 - 00:29:19 (26 sec),"Thank you very much, Phil. Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves. Tate? Tate? Where is Tate? Thanks, Tate. Doing a good job. And Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann. Delbert? Thank you. Thank you. And I want to thank your members of Congress that are here, because they've been warriors, they've been friends."
00:29:19 - 00:29:38 (19 sec),"They helped me with the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country... the biggest tax reform, the great regulation cuts, which could be even more important, frankly, than the tax cuts, if you want to know the truth, because it means jobs. But you have some great -- Congressman Trent Kelly. Trent, thank you."
00:29:38 - 00:30:14 (36 sec),"Gregg Harper. Thank you very much. And David Kustoff. Thank you, David. There's another warrior in the room. These are warriors. Look, the abuse they take, the abuse we all take, if you're not a warrior, you just go home, go to the corner, put your thumb in your mouth and say, ""Mommy, take me home."" You got to be a warrior."
00:30:14 - 00:30:54 (40 sec),"And a guy who is a wonderful friend of mine and has always been there for me, Senator Roger Wicker. Roger? What a great -- and Mrs. Wicker, thank you. What a great guy. And he's doing great. Get out and vote for him, anyway. He's winning by a lot, but get out there and vote. We love Roger. Finally, I want to introduce the person we are all here tonight to support, a true Mississippi patriot, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. Come on up. Cindy, come up."
00:30:54 - 00:31:41 (47 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. And I told him he would get a warm Mississippi welcome, and you did not disappoint. Yes! We are the Hospitality State, Mr. President. And I tell you, it is such an honor to work with this man. Is he not the best president we have ever had? This is wonderful."
00:31:41 - 00:32:13 (32 sec),"You know, early on, I was a supporter of then-candidate Donald J. Trump, and I was on his ag advisory committee. And now every time I walk onto the Senate floor, I want to help President Donald J. Trump. It is such an honor to work with a man that, I'll tell you, he loves the veterans, he loves the military, and he loves our law enforcement, as well."
00:32:13 - 00:32:40 (27 sec),"You know, this past week -- this past week in Brookhaven, Mississippi, my hometown, we had two officers shot down this past weekend. And I was able to tell him about that, James White and Zack Moak. And then the next day, we had a Mississippi Highway Patrol trooper, Josh Smith, shot down. And I'm just going to ask you to remember those people in your prayers as we continue on with this."
00:32:40 - 00:33:11 (31 sec),"We've had a tragic week in Mississippi with our law enforcement, but this man supports law enforcement 100 percent. I just want to thank our great governor, Phil Bryant, for making me your U.S. senator, to appoint me to that, an opportunity of three lifetimes. Other than being the mother of Anna Michael Smith and the husband of Mike Smith, it is the greatest honor of my life."
00:33:11 - 00:33:28 (17 sec),"And what a treat to serve with Senator Roger Wicker. When I tell you he's been a friend, he has been a friend to me on the Senate floor, no doubt. I tell you, you know, when I was sworn in as your U.S. senator, Vice President Mike Pence, he put this pin right here on me, and he said, ""Cindy, this pin will get you in any door in Washington, D.C."" But I want you to know, this isn't my pin."
00:33:28 - 00:33:40 (13 sec),"This is your pin. This is Mississippi's pin. We've got a lot of work to do in Washington, D.C. This man is leading the charge. We're going to get back on Air Force One, and we're going back to Washington, because you know what? We've got a Supreme Court justice to get confirmed! We got to. So I'm going to ask for your prayers, also, for the Kavanaugh family."
00:33:40 - 00:33:43 (3 sec),"And I'll tell you tonight, my true prayer is God will continue to bless these great state  of the United States!"
00:33:43 - 00:33:53 (9 sec),"Thank you, Cindy. [Audience Chants USA] Thank you, Cindy. Great. You know we had a great friend who was senator, and did a fantastic job, and it was just his time. He called me, it was his time. And you know who I'm talking about, wonderful man. And he said, ""You're going to have to appoint somebody."" And I went to Phil."
00:33:53 - 00:34:38 (45 sec),"I said, ""Phil, who's the best?"" And Phil had no doubt in his mind. That's who he recommended. And since then, Cindy has voted with me 100 percent of the time. She's always had my back. She's always had your back. And a vote for Cindy is a vote for me and make America great again. And a vote for Cindy's opponent, Mike Espy, is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary low-IQ person Maxine Waters."
00:34:38 - 00:35:19 (41 sec),"That's why Schumer's PAC is funding Mike Espy with a lot of money. A vote for Espy is a vote for the Democrat agenda to open borders and for radical socialism. When Espy was in Congress, he even sponsored legislation alongside Nancy Pelosi to provide taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens. Oh, that's great."
00:35:19 - 00:35:47 (28 sec),That's just what Mississippi wants. I don't think that works in Mississippi. Does that work? I don't think so. I don't think so. Your vote in this election will decide which party controls the United States Senate. It's very important. Very important. And that's a great woman. That's a great woman. Gotten to know her very well over the last number of months.
00:35:47 - 00:36:10 (24 sec),"If Democrats get control, they will raise your taxes, flood your streets with criminal aliens, weaken our military, outlaw private health insurance, and replace freedom with socialism. In a short period of time -- of course, I'll be doing lots of vetoes, just so don't worry too much -- they will turn America into Venezuela."
00:36:10 - 00:36:35 (25 sec),"How's that working out? And our country will never be Venezuela. We won't let that happen. If Democrats get 51 seats, the key Senate committees will be run by the far left Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. It's amazing that he wasn't more angry that the election got stolen from him, right? I don't get it. You know, he's always like complaining, complaining."
00:36:35 - 00:36:51 (15 sec),"He's jumping around. The hair's going crazy. The hair's going crazy. He's jumping like a lunatic. But he never complained about the fact that crooked Hillary cheated him out of the election. It's amazing. It's amazing. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up] You know, Bernie was on television recently. And he was screaming and ranting and raving."
00:36:51 - 00:37:14 (23 sec),"And I said to my wife, Melania, who's now in Africa representing us, first lady... I watched her get off that plane this morning in Africa. And so beautiful. And she was hugging and kissing children. It was beautiful to see. She's doing a great job as first lady, I will tell you. Really great. And you think that's an easy job?"
00:37:14 - 00:37:40 (26 sec),"That's not an easy job. That's a tough job. She's fantastic. But Bernie Sanders was ranting and raving and ""We're going to this"" and ""Trump and Trump and we got to stop"" -- what he's going to stop? Having a strong military? Having low taxes? Having borders? What's he going to stop? What am I doing? What's he going to stop?"
00:37:40 - 00:38:07 (27 sec),"Having less regulation? But he's going to stop Trump. He's going to stop Trump. He's going to stop us left and right. He's ranting and raving. And the commentator looks at him and goes, ""You know he's winning, don't you?"" And Bernie just looked at him like this. It was like -- but I said to my -- you got to hand it to him."
00:38:07 - 00:38:56 (49 sec),"You know, he's out there. He's doing his thing, whether you like it or not. He's out there doing his thing, and you've got to hand it to him. But a guy like Bernie would be in charge of the Budget Committee. Patrick Leahy -- oh, he's never had a drink in his life. [Laughter] Check it out. Look under ""Patrick Leahy/drink."" [Laughter] ""How dare you have a beer while you're in high school?"
00:38:56 - 00:39:27 (32 sec),"How dare."" ""Patrick Leahy-drink"" will be in charge of the Appropriations Committee. Bob Menendez -- you don't know about him -- will be in -- I'll leave him alone, because we can't cover too many of these characters, right? But I'm going to leave him alone -- will be in charge of Foreign Affairs. And the great Dianne Feinstein... will be in charge of the Judiciary Committee."
00:39:27 - 00:39:46 (19 sec),"No. Wasn't that great? Wasn't that great? Wasn't that something the other day? She was asked a simple question, ""Did you leak the document?"" -- wasn't that great? -- by John Cornyn. He goes, ""You leaked the document."" ""No. What? No."" ""Uh, remember?"" ""No. Oh, no, I didn't. No, I don't think I -- well, wait."
00:39:46 - 00:40:08 (22 sec),"Did we leak the document? No."" [Laughter] ""How about the aide?"" ""No, you idiot! No!"" [Laughter] ""No, we didn't leak the document. We didn't leak the document. No, we didn't."" That was the worst body language that I've ever seen. Oh, what a group. What a group. Holier than thou, aren't they? Holier than thou."
00:40:08 - 00:40:41 (33 sec),"You know the expression, right? What a group. Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats in Washington want to raid Medicare to pay for their socialist agenda. They're going to destroy it. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and paid for it, right? Right? And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing location."
00:40:41 - 00:41:37 (56 sec),"We're going to have to do that. Pre-existing conditions. We have to take care of pre-existing conditions, because it's just the way life is, folks. We have to do that. And the Democrats are talking about it and they can't do it, because they have no plan. So just put it down. And some Republicans say, ""Is that a Republican thing?"" Whether it is or not -- and to me it is, and it always will be -- pre-existing conditions will always be taken care of by us. Have to do it. We have to do it. We have to do it, and we want to do it. I want to do it. We're all going to do it. We're doing well."
00:41:37 - 00:42:11 (33 sec),"We'll take it from China. We'll take it from the European Union, who has taken advantage of us for years. We'll take it from Japan. We'll take it from our new, beautiful transaction, which is a fair transaction, and good for them, too, Mexico, Canada. We're going to have plenty of money coming in, folks, when we fix up these horrible trade deals."
00:42:11 - 00:42:37 (26 sec),"So we're going to take care of pre-existing conditions. People that have a problem are going to be helped by the Republican Party from -- from the time I got elected, really. You look at what we've done with Obamacare. It's a disaster. We had it beaten. But I'll say it a different way than I have been saying it. We didn't get one Democrat vote."
00:42:37 - 00:43:04 (27 sec),"We had it repealed and replaced. A little shocked took place early in the morning. But the fact is, we didn't get one Democrat vote. We would have saved a trillion dollars -- think of it -- our country would have saved $1 trillion had we gotten that extra vote. We didn't get one vote from one Democrat. But we've pretty much dismantled it. And here's a nice story."
00:43:04 - 00:43:37 (33 sec),"We've managed it well. And your premiums have gone up very little by -- remember, they were going up 156, 201, 187, 116 percent? Now we have it down. But we're getting rid of it entirely. We're going to have great health care. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE -- the brave, brave people of ICE."
00:43:37 - 00:44:14 (37 sec),"In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. That's what they want to do. Democrats also support strongly sanctuary cities of death. Sanctuary cities. Every day, sanctuary cities are unleashing vicious predators and bloodthirsty killers, like MS-13, into our communities. They go out and they hide out in sanctuary cities."
00:44:14 - 00:44:38 (24 sec),"Then they come into our cities and our towns. And then we send ICE in, and ICE has no problem. You know why? Because ICE is much tougher and much smarter than them. And ICE has done an incredible job. And they grab them by the neck and they throw them the hell out of our country or they throw them into jail."
00:44:38 - 00:45:04 (26 sec),"And you don't want that job. And you don't want that job. And you don't even want -- although maybe you could handle that job, right? But they do a fantastic job. And we have to cherish our law enforcement. And that goes for Border Patrol, that goes for ICE. We're setting records on the border on arrests."
00:45:04 - 00:45:30 (27 sec),"We don't want to do that. We're building the wall. It's going up. But getting money is brutal -- brutal. [Audience Chants Build the Wall] So we've started the wall. And we've done a lot in California and elsewhere -- San Diego. We're moving eastward, and we're covering a lot of territory. They gave us $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and another $1.6 billion."
00:45:30 - 00:46:17 (46 sec),"I want the whole thing, because we can do the whole damn wall, and we can do a great one in one year. But getting money from the Democrats is tough, because they know that's a big issue for us. And they know we need it. Most of them voted for it in 2006. I don't know if you know that. Most of them. But, of course, you have to have a wall."
00:46:17 - 00:47:15 (59 sec),"You have people pouring across. They're tackling people. And then, of course, they have catch and release. You catch somebody. ""Who is this person?"" ""It's a criminal."" ""Oh, that's OK. Catch, take his name and release the person."" And the person they think will come back to court. We have the dumbest immigration laws in the whole world."
00:47:15 - 00:47:45 (30 sec),"Watch what happens over the next couple of weeks, folks. Watch. Watch. And it's all because of the Democrats. Every Republican wants some change. But they stop you. The only thing they're good at -- they're lousy politicians. They're horrible in policy. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They're only good at one thing: resisting."
00:47:45 - 00:48:37 (51 sec),"They're good at sticking together. You rarely see them break up. They stick like glue. They stick. That's the only thing they're good at: delay and resist. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. If you want security, if you want a strong border, if you want to have a country that is a great, great, safe country, then you need to go out and you need to vote Republican."
00:48:37 - 00:49:08 (32 sec),"Have to do it. And everybody. This election in November is about safety and it's also about prosperity. They're going to take your wealth away from you. They're going to take your wealth away. All of that we've done with the jobs and the salaries and the wages that are rising for the first time in 21 years, they're going to take it away from you so fast."
00:49:08 - 00:49:44 (35 sec),"Since the election, we have created over 4 million new jobs. Unheard of. Unheard of! Unheard of! And lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. That's a big thing. We've added nearly 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. You remember when the previous administration said, ""Oh, you can't do manufacturing""? I said, ""Really, who's going to build things?"" They said, ""You won't add any."" They said you needed a magic wand, remember?"
00:49:44 - 00:50:10 (26 sec),"A magic wand. We don't have a magic wand. We've got good policy. We've got good leadership. We have a lot of good leaders in our party. And you've heard this many times over the last three weeks: African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded -- ever! Ever! Remember ""What do you have to lose?"" What do you have to lose, right?"
00:50:10 - 00:50:34 (24 sec),"What do you have to lose? I said. And people said, ""Oh, that's not nice."" But I said, ""Wait, they have the worst crime rate. They have the worst schools. They have the worst homeownership percentages. They have the"" -- I went through a list of 10 different things. And I looked up, and they've always voted for Democrats, the African-Americans, 95, more, percent."
00:50:34 - 00:51:10 (36 sec),"And I looked up and I said, ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" Remember? And now... Not only do they have the lowest unemployment rate in history, but African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate also ever recorded. It's a great thing, right? So -- and we've just started. We've just started. Remember, same true for Hispanic Americans, the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded."
00:51:10 - 00:51:54 (43 sec),"Same for Asian Americans, lowest unemployment rate ever recorded. Women, lowest unemployment rate in 65 years. After years and years of working so hard, we finally put ourselves in a position where we can do things. And we can really do them. But we could do them an awfully lot better if we had more -- a real majority, not a majority of one, not a majority of literally if somebody's sick, it's like we have to postpone votes."
00:51:54 - 00:52:14 (20 sec),"We need a real majority, and we're going to do everything that you've been looking for for a long time. You know, with that being said, we've done so much. We've done so much. We've just finalized the tremendous new trade agreement with South Korea, where it was a disaster. That was a Hillary Clinton catastrophe."
00:52:14 - 00:52:39 (25 sec),"Remember she said, ""We are going to create 250,000 new jobs""? And she was right, for South Korea. It was good. [Laughter] And we've just totally renegotiated it. We've made it good. And we've opened up new negotiations with Japan, who would not negotiate with the previous administration. You know why? Because they said, ""No, we're happy."
00:52:39 - 00:53:07 (28 sec),"Why should we negotiate? We're not going to negotiate."" Well, we said, ""We want to negotiate."" And with the European Union, ""We want to negotiate."" And they said... [Audience member calls out 'We Love You'] I love you, too. You're not my type, but I love you. That was a strong guy, by the way, in case... [Laughter] Because if that was a woman, I'm in big trouble."
00:53:07 - 00:53:40 (33 sec),"And you know what? I go, I hope you're a guy. Are you? So -- so the European Union and Japan, I said, ""Listen, we lost $151 billion, with a B, with you."" We lost $151 billion. Jean-Claude -- he's the head of the European Union -- I said, ""Jean-Claude"" -- he's tough and smart, smart, really tough. I don't think he likes our country too much, but I've told him that many times."
00:53:40 - 00:54:00 (20 sec),"Well, they were formed -- right? -- they were formed in order to take advantage of us. ""So, Jean-Claude, for years, the Obama administration wanted to negotiate and you said, 'No, we're not going to negotiate.' I'm telling you, I want to negotiate."" We lost $151 billion with the European Union. Many of us come from the European Union."
00:54:00 - 00:54:20 (20 sec),"I do. I do. Many of the people in the room, sounds so nice, European Union. And they're just killing us. So I said, ""We have to negotiate."" ""Oh, yes, yes."" Two weeks go by, we don't get a call. I call him up again, I say, ""Jean-Claude! We got to negotiate."" ""Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes."" Beautiful accent."
00:54:20 - 00:54:48 (28 sec),"I wish I had his accent. [Laughter] I would have been president 15 years ago if I had his accent. And I said, ""Jean-Claude, please, we got to negotiate! I can't take this, $151 billion we lose. You have barriers against our farmers. We can't sell farm products. You have barriers against our cars, and yet you give us millions of Mercedes and BMW and all these cars, they pour into our country."
00:54:48 - 00:55:11 (22 sec),"You have barriers and you charge us big tariffs for products. And you make it impossible for us to give you -- but you sell us so much. Jean-Claude, we have to negotiate."" And he said, ""Oh, yes, yes, yes."" Two weeks go by. No negotiation. I say, ""Jean-Claude, you don't have to negotiate anymore, Jean-Claude."
00:55:11 - 00:55:38 (27 sec),"I am going to put a 25 percent tariff on Mercedes Benz, BMW, and every car you send in to the United States."" ""We're putting a 25 percent tariff or tax on every car, millions and millions of cars, that you send in to the United States."" He said, ""No, no, no, please! I will be there tomorrow morning."" This was an evening."
00:55:38 - 00:56:02 (24 sec),"I get to my office. He's there. [Laughter] I said, ""Where did you come from, New York?"" ""No, no, no, I came from Europe."" I said, ""Let me know the name of that plane. That is the fastest plane."" [Laughter] And now they're dying to make a deal. You saw what's been going on with these deals. China! They're draining us. They're taking our money."
00:56:02 - 00:56:37 (35 sec),"They're rebuilding themselves. They're building a jet a day. They're building many, many bridges the size and bigger than, like, the George Washington Bridge. What are we doing? We're helping them. We've rebuilt China. They've taken so much money. I like President Xi, the head of China, but I said, ""We can't do this anymore."" So now we put $50 billion of tariffs on. And they said... They said, ""No, no, no, no, you cannot do that."
00:56:37 - 00:57:00 (23 sec),"If you go $50 billion, we'll go $50 billion."" I said, ""Wait a minute, we're already $500 billion behind. So if I go $50 billion, you go $50 billion, that means we're at the same place we started from. That's not what this is all about. We have to bring some balance. We can't do this."" So they said, ""No."" So it's $50 billion at 10 percent."
00:57:00 - 00:57:30 (30 sec),"I increased it to 25 percent, and I put $200 billion on top of the $50 billion. So now we have $250 billion at 25 percent. By the way, billions and billions of dollars. The fake news people back there, all those people with all those red lights... they don't want to talk about it. But all of that money, billions of dollars will be flowing in to our treasury."
00:57:30 - 00:58:00 (30 sec),"Many of the products that we're buying over there will be made in the United States because they don't want to pay the tax and there's no tariffs. And I said, ""If you attack our farmers, who I love"" -- they're special. See, he's got the green hat on? ""Make Our Farmers Great Again."" Right? ""Make Our Farmers Great Again."" But they said, ""You know what?"
00:58:00 - 00:58:26 (26 sec),"The farmers love Trump. We'll attack the farmers by not buying"" -- well, guess what? They're starting to buy again, aren't they? But I said, ""If you do that, we're going to put an additional $267 billion onto your numbers. So we're going to have $500 billion and probably it'll end up $562 billion when you add it all up, including the little stars all over the place."" And you know what?"
00:58:26 - 00:58:48 (22 sec),"They want to talk. They want to make a deal. Then China's been hurt very badly over the last number of months. Their markets are down 30 percent. And our markets are up 55 percent since I became president. And I hope we can make a deal with China, but honestly, who knows? But we're very happy where we are."
00:58:48 - 00:59:08 (19 sec),"Very, very happy. And I want to thank the farmers, because, you know, I watch the farmers. And they say -- and don't forget, the farmers have been going down like this for 20 years; long before I got here. We're going to bring those green caps. You're going to be so proud of me, OK? You're going to be so proud."
00:59:08 - 00:59:30 (23 sec),"They want to talk. And at some point, they're talking. But I told them just recently, ""You're not ready to talk yet. You're not ready."" In all fairness, they've been making so much money. It's hard for them to say -- they're making $500 billion a year because we had -- ha, let's be nice -- we had presidents that it wasn't their thing."
00:59:30 - 00:59:51 (21 sec),"But it is my thing. Do you know how wealthy our country would be if they didn't have these really stupid deals all over the place, so many of them? And how about our military deals, where we protect rich nations and we don't get reimbursed? How about that stuff? That's changing, too, folks. We protect Saudi Arabia."
00:59:51 - 01:00:20 (29 sec),"Would you say they're rich? And I love the king, King Salman. But I said, ""King, we're protecting you. You might not be there for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military."" ""You have to pay."" And Japan is going to also contribute. Japan -- we protect Japan. They pay us a small percentage. We protect South Korea."
01:00:20 - 01:00:44 (24 sec),"They pay us -- and by the way, we're doing great on North Korea, but South Korea. They got to reimburse us. They've got to reimburse us. Republicans passed and I signed the biggest package of tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. We have cut a record number of regulations. Now, we got no Democrat support for any of this."
01:00:44 - 01:01:24 (39 sec),"This is what's driving our economy, those two things. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs. Watch what's going to happen to drug prices. And to help critically ill patients get access to life-saving treatments, we passed what's called Right to Try. A person's terminally ill, they're going to die, and before me, if we had a drug that was really looking good or promising, we wouldn't give them, because we didn't want to hurt the person."
01:01:24 - 01:01:46 (22 sec),"They're going to die. And it is actually much more complicated than that. They've been trying to pass this for 45 years. Well, two months ago, I signed Right to Try. We have the greatest drugs in the world, the greatest drugmakers in the world. I would watch wealthy people travel all over the world trying to find a cure."
01:01:46 - 01:02:09 (24 sec),"And poor people just went home. They had no hope. Now they have the right to try. If we have a drug that looks good but it's two years or three years or four years out -- and, by the way, we brought that number from 15 years, we think it's going to be down to four and in some cases three. Way down. Scott is doing a great job."
01:02:09 - 01:02:33 (24 sec),"Scott, get that number down, Scott. And now we have that -- I love that. Right to Try, such a great name. Right to Try. You have hope. We also passed veterans' choice. Forty-four years they tried to do it. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor if they've got to wait on line for weeks and weeks and weeks."
01:02:33 - 01:03:05 (32 sec),"Forty-four years! And we passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act. That's people that work in the V.A. that treat our veterans badly, and we couldn't do a thing about it, and now we can fire them so fast... I just signed legislation -- and you think that was easy, getting that through the unions and civil service?"
01:03:05 - 01:03:47 (42 sec),"That was a 48-year job. And your two senators helped me a lot, I will tell you. They helped me a lot. Thank you, Cindy. Thank you, Roger. And your congressmen, by the way, helped me a lot -- in particular your congressman. I just signed legislation to completely rebuild our military, securing $700 billion, and then the following year $716 billion to purchase the finest planes and ships and tanks and missiles and submarines on the face of the Earth, all made in America, made in the USA."
01:03:47 - 01:04:16 (29 sec),"And we have given our troops their largest pay raise in more than a decade. Isn't that nice? About time. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working very hard to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces. It's called the Space Force. So you have the Air Force, you have the Space Force. Separate."
01:04:16 - 01:04:47 (30 sec),"The Space Force. And that's what it's all about, folks. You look at what's happening. I'm not just talking rockets to the moon and to Mars. I'm talking about defense. I'm talking about -- that's where it is. It's in space. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, right? Space Force! I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal."
01:04:47 - 01:05:06 (20 sec),"And Iran is a much different country. They're trying to put out all the riots they have all over that country. You know, when I became a president, I looked there -- before I became -- I said, ""How are you stopping Iran?"" Nobody was able to tell me. And I did this and they have shattered, man. They have shattered."
01:05:06 - 01:05:36 (30 sec),"I got rid of that deal. How about we gave them $150 billion for nothing? We gave them $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. And we've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we won't even mention how well we're doing with North Korea. But when I came in there, too, they were going to go to war with North Korea."
01:05:36 - 01:05:58 (22 sec),"President Obama said it was his biggest problem. We sat before I took office. ""What's your biggest problem?"" ""Biggest problem is North Korea. We were going to go with North Korea."" We're doing very well now with North Korea. You don't feel that way anymore, right? You don't feel that way anymore. And the fake news comes out and says, ""He's giving so much."" I haven't given anything."
01:05:58 - 01:06:28 (30 sec),"We got our hostages back, right? We've got a lot and we're getting the remains of our great fallen heroes back. There's been no rockets launched. There's been no missiles launched. There's been no nuclear tests. And we have a good relationship. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going over to North Korea next week."
01:06:28 - 01:06:48 (20 sec),"And we're working on a second summit. And it just feels good. Now, who knows, folks? Who knows? I can just tell you, when we came in, before I came in, and at the beginning when the rhetoric was tough, right, that rhetoric was tough, these people were saying, ""Oh, he's going to get us into a war."" Well, guess what?"
01:06:48 - 01:07:18 (30 sec),"That worked out. That rhetoric was tough. And let's see what happens. But we're doing very well. We're doing very well. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Mississippi."
01:07:18 - 01:08:15 (57 sec),"We are standing proudly. We are standing up for your national anthem. Right? [Audience Chants USA] A lot of spirit. A lot of spirit. One of them said the other day, ""You know, President Trump can't be beaten in 2020."" That's driving them crazy. Oh! Who the hell's going to beat us? Look, who's going to beat us? If another president came in, and they said, ""We're coming to Mississippi, and we're going to make a speech,"" you know how many people would show up? Really, 300, 400. You'd have a medium-sized meeting room at a hotel."
01:08:15 - 01:09:03 (47 sec),"Look at this place. Look at this place. Look at this place! We're lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get out and vote Republican, vote for Cindy Hyde-Smith and vote for Roger Wicker."
01:09:03 - 01:09:40 (37 sec),"Got to do it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation and more products made right here in the USA. It's a vote to reduce crime, respect law enforcement and restore the rule of law. It's a vote for strong borders, safe communities and thriving families, which you are. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, destruction, chaos, and to come together as neighbors, as citizens and as Americans."
01:09:40 - 01:10:07 (27 sec),"To everyone in this room tonight, to every citizen watching all across our land, this is your time to choose. Very important time when you look at what's happening to Judge Kavanaugh. This is a very important time. It's time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past or whether we continue forward into the unlimited promise of our future."
01:10:07 - 01:10:41 (34 sec),"It's not up to the media or the pundits to decide your fate. It's up to you. The future is in your hands, as it was in 2016. That was a beautiful time. There has never been an election like this in our country's history. You have the power -- just as you did in 2016 -- with your vote to same America from socialism and to save America from decay."
01:10:41 - 01:11:16 (35 sec),"It's up to you on November 6th to choose a future of patriotism, prosperity and pride. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to everyday Americans. We stand on the shoulder of the giants of American history, the greatest, the toughest, the most courageous men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth."
01:11:16 - 01:12:09 (53 sec),"Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, won a revolution, and fought to victory in two world wars. Think of it. Think of it. Right? Think of it. American patriots defeated fascism, triumphed over communism, and delivered millions and millions and millions of people into freedom. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to tear down their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage, right?"
01:12:09 - 01:12:37 (28 sec),"Just like the pioneers and patriots who came before us, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory."
01:12:37 - 01:13:35 (58 sec),"Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Mississippi. Get out and vote. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:02:00 (120 sec),"Hello, Kansas, thank you very much. Hello, Kansas. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be here with all of my friends on this truly historic night. This is a historic night. I stand before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our nation, our people, and our beloved constitution. Just a few hours ago the U.S. Senate confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court, and I proudly signed the judge's commission aboard Air Force One just before landing."
00:02:00 - 00:02:33 (33 sec),"And this Monday night, at 7:00 pm in the East Room of the White House, We will perform the swearing in ceremony for soon-to-be Justice Kavanaugh, a great man. And he will sit proudly alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch, who's doing a great job to uphold your sacred rights and to defend your God-given freedom."
00:02:33 - 00:03:15 (42 sec),"And I want to thank our incredible Republican senators for refusing to back down in the face of the Democrats, shameless campaign of political and personal destruction. Since the moment Brett Kavanaugh was senate, and you remember this, we made an announcement and since right from the moment we announced, radical Democrats launched a disgraceful campaign to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy, right from the beginning."
00:03:15 - 00:03:39 (24 sec),"Brett Kavanaugh is a man of great character and intellect. He's a totally brilliant scholar, who has devoted his life to the law, he is a loving husband, a devoted father, and a faithful public servant, and he always has been. What he and his wonderful family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable, unthinkable."
00:03:39 - 00:04:11 (32 sec),"In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob, you saw that today with the screaming and the shouting, not from the 200 people or less that were --  You know what? Those people, they couldn't fit in the front row, look what we have here today. They threw away and threw aside every notion of fairness, of justice, of decency and of due process."
00:04:11 - 00:04:45 (34 sec),"Nobody's seen anything like it. What each of you will have a chance in just four weeks to render your verdict on the Democrats conduct at the ballot box. Got to vote, got to vote.  On November 6th, you will have the chance to stop the radical Democrats, and that's what they've become, by electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate. We will increase our majorities. We need more Republicans, we need more Republicans."
00:04:45 - 00:05:30 (45 sec),"Over the past few weeks, every American has now seen the profound stakes in the upcoming election. You now see it. We have been energized, we have been energized. if Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, Just imagine the devastation they would cause if they ever obtained the power they so desperately want, and Greg. You'll going to have other Supreme Court justices places to be filled it could be three, it could even be four, it could be a lot."
00:05:30 - 00:06:06 (36 sec),"And if you allow the wrong people to get into office, things could change, they could change, and they could change fast. And we're not going to let that happen, we can't let that happen. It could go very quickly, it can change very fast, we can't let that happen. You don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry leftwing mob, and that's what they've become. The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern."
00:06:06 - 00:06:33 (27 sec),"Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob. We're doing a hell of a job of doing it, we're draining the swamp and we want to defeat the Democrats conducively. So under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, America is winning because we are finally putting America first, we are putting America first."
00:06:33 - 00:07:08 (35 sec),"Yesterday it was announced that unemployment has fallen to 3.7%, the lowest  unemployment rate in 50 years, lowest in 50 years. We've created nearly 600,000 jobs in the last three months alone, think of that, 600,000, and if I ever said that, when I was campaigning, the fake news media would go, I'd say, ""Impossible."" They are fake."
00:07:08 - 00:08:17 (69 sec),"Manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high. Confidence, very important, all-time high. And we have the best economy in the history of our country, the best.We're taking care of our veterans, protecting our great seniors, and rebuilding America's military might like it hasn't been built before. But if Democrats take control, they will try to plunge our country into gridlock poverty and chaos, and that's what's going to happen, it can change."
00:08:17 - 00:08:53 (35 sec),"The Democrats want to significantly raise your taxes. Essentially, they want to impose socialism, Venezuela, dismantle law enforcement and eliminate our borders. They want to have nice, open borders, no way. Bill. The Democrats have become the party of crime, they have become the party of crime, think of it. Republicans are the party of law and order, and justice."
00:08:53 - 00:09:18 (25 sec),"And we really have become, even more so, than ever before the party of opportunity and wealth, and that's what's happening with creating wealth for everybody. Whether it's small businesses big businesses or people wanting great jobs, that's what's happening. And you know wages? Right now, for the first time in 19 years, wages are going up for people, and jobs. you can choose the job you want for the first time. Many years."
00:09:18 - 00:09:45 (28 sec),"So we are thrilled to be joined by a number of your state's terrific Republican leaders. And  I have to tell you that I wasn't supposed to be here because, you know, this is such a big day. This is such a big day. I was supposed to call you, they said, ""Do you mind calling Kris Kobach and Steve Watkins? Do you mind telling them?"
00:09:45 - 00:10:19 (34 sec),"That because of the fact that we are, today, getting this great, great, talented, wonderful Supreme Court judge. They said, ""Could you call the people of Kansas and tell them we won't be able to make it tonight.?"" I said, ""I don't have the courage to do that. I don't have the courage"" I said, ""I don't have the courage."" They call me, they said, ""Sir, we're signing the next United States Supreme Court justice."""
00:10:19 - 00:10:51 (32 sec),"They always say, you've heard it. The biggest thing a president can do, they've always said, is Supreme Court justice the biggest, and some of it none. We've had two in less than two years, I guess, you know, some of [Inaudible] some presidents have it. But it's the biggest thing you can do so they said, ""Sir, do you mind canceling Kansas tonight? We're going to have -- "" I said, ""No way I'm canceling Kansas. No way. No way."""
00:10:51 - 00:11:16 (25 sec),"I had that phone working, I had that phone working on that plane, I had that signature going on the plane, and here we are. And by the way, you think this crowd inside is big, you could see the crowd that's outside. We just put up big movie screens but I think this is better, right? This is better. I want to thank Congressman Roger Marshall, has been a great friend."
00:11:16 - 00:11:34 (18 sec),"Roger has been a great friend, and a great friend also, Ron Estes, great person. He helped us so much with the tax cuts, with regulation cuts, with so many things that we've passed that nobody thought would be possible, would be possible. So thank you both very much. Where are they? Where are they? Thank you very much, fellas, thank you. Fantastic"
00:11:34 - 00:12:18 (44 sec),"And also, I want to thank somebody who's done a fantastic job, GOP Chair Kelly Arnold. Kelly? Great job. You know why a great job? Because we won this state by a lot, right?  And after what I just did for you with the new deal with Mexico and Canada, I think we should double it up, I think we should double it up. USMCA, USMCA. I refused to call it NAFTA because NAFTA was such a horrible deal."
00:12:18 - 00:12:57 (39 sec),"You didn't even realize it, that was so --  50,000 plants and factories emptied out, millions and millions of jobs lost, so we negotiated a new deal, and I said,  ""There's no way of calling it NAFTA 2, USMCA. And we opened up -- we opened up agriculture, we opened up dairy, we opened up a lot of things and everybody's really happy."
00:12:57 - 00:13:32 (35 sec),"I don't know how they're doing in the other places but they're really happy. So congratulations. Congratulations. And we also signed a great new deal with South Korea and the farmers are going to be benefiting there too. And we're working -- Right now they  want to make a deal. I said,  ""You're not ready to make a deal yet."" We're working on a deal with China."
00:13:32 - 00:14:03 (31 sec),"We'll see. Well see. Well see. Look, they've been hitting us hard for a long time. We've never had a president that did anything about it. $500 billion a year, that's a big one. They take out. So right now we're doing extremely well with China, and let's see what happens. Maybe we'll do it and if we don't we're going to be in even better position, you understand that. So we'll see."
00:14:03 - 00:14:42 (40 sec),"I also want to thank a man of incredible integrity and class, your governor, Jeff Collier. Jeff? Jeff? Where's Jeff? Jeff is a great guy who's doing a really incredible job and thank you, Jeff. But I didn't know Jeff. I told Jeff, I said, ""Nothing personal, I just didn't know you because when I backed Chris and you have one hell of a governor."" And I think we have to talk about bringing him down to Washington or something. We talked about it."
00:14:42 - 00:15:06 (24 sec),"Great governor, great man. We're also joined by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt. Thank you. And president of the Kansas State Senate Susan Wagle. Susan. Thank you, Susan. I'm so proud that our Campaign Manager Brad Parscale, you know Brad, Brad Parscale. Where's Brad? Guy's like 7 feet tall, so you can't miss him. Thank you, Brad."
00:15:06 - 00:15:38 (32 sec),"Our chief, our chief you know him, our Chief Operating Officer Mike Glassner. You know Michael? He's fantastic right from the beginning. Thank you, Michael. They all come from Kansas. They all come from Kansas. I guess that's how we win, you get from Kansas you wouldn't lose them. Along with our amazing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He is doing a great job."
00:15:38 - 00:16:06 (28 sec),"He's headed over to North Korea. This guy travels, boy you got to do that to be a good one. You know, if you're home a lot you're not doing much of a good job. We're doing a great job with North Korea we're doing a great job with everybody. Mike Pompeo from Kansas. Great man. And also here with us tonight is your next lieutenant governor, Wink Hartman. Thank you, Wink. Thank you, Wink."
00:16:06 - 00:16:30 (25 sec),"So a man that's been with me from the beginning, he's tough, he's strong and I hated that he ran because I would have loved to have brought him into my administration, effectively loses, I'll bring him into my administration in two seconds. I hope he loses because I want him so badly. But don't do that."
00:16:30 - 00:17:45 (74 sec),"Don't you. Don't do that. I was angry when he did it. I said, ""Don't do it."" ""Sir, I want to be the governor of Kansas. I love my people."" I said, ""Don't do it. Don't do it."" I was very unhappy. I was very, very unhappy. I said, ""Don't do it."" Then he went out and he's been winning and he's been doing an incredible job. But he does, he loves this state. He loves the state so much and I want to introduce the next governor of Kansas, Kris Kobach."
00:17:45 - 00:18:33 (48 sec),"Well let me just say on behalf of all of Kansas, President Trump, welcome to Trump country. It is such an honor and a blessing to have President Trump here in the city where I grew up to support my campaign in the state that we all love. And I want to give President Trump credit for something really important, it's something he and I have worked together on. We've worked for a number of things but the most important is stopping illegal immigration.  I'm so glad that America has a president who gets it and knows that illegal means illegal."
00:18:33 - 00:18:57 (24 sec),"I want to tell you a quick short story about illegal immigration. I began working on this issue when I was an adviser to John Ashcroft at the time of 9/11. I was there during 9/11, and we all remember how the world changed. But let me tell you something that you may not know. All 19 hijackers came into this country legally on temporary visas."
00:18:57 - 00:19:25 (28 sec),"Five of them became illegal mostly by overstaying their visas. Four of those five were stopped by state and local law enforcement for speeding violations. They were illegally in the country at the time but the cops didn't know it, and so they could -- they didn't make an arrest even though they could have if they'd had that information at their fingertips."
00:19:25 - 00:20:24 (59 sec),Now get this. Three of those for pi -- the three of those for illegal aliens that they could have arrested were pilots. So if they had made those arrests they could have stopped 9/11 from happening. Those numbers have shaped my career. The gravity of that has never left me and I will not and I know President Trump will not allow our immigration system to be used again as a weapon to harm the American people.
00:20:24 - 00:20:42 (18 sec),"Stopping illegal aliens is not just about jobs, it's not just about crime. i's about our nation's security, and that comes first. And illegal immigration is an issue in this campaign for governor. Did you know that my opponent Laura Kelly voted to continue allowing sanctuary cities in Kansas? She did. She did. Look it up. It's in the roll call vote."
00:20:42 - 00:21:33 (51 sec),"When I am governor, God willing, sanctuary cities will end in this state. Laura Kelly also voted to allow illegal aliens to continue getting welfare benefits. So while we're struggling to pay our electricity bill to pay higher taxes, we're meanwhile giving taxpayer dollars to illegal aliens. Is that fair? It's time to stop illegal aliens from getting taxpayer dollars."
00:21:33 - 00:21:53 (20 sec),"It's time to put Kansans first, not illegal aliens. There's another big issue. [Crowd cheering] There's another big issue that President Trump and I have both been concerned about. Voter fraud. Because of the law that I drafted in the Kansas legislature passed, Kansas now has the most secure election laws in America. Photo ID creates trust in our elections."
00:21:53 - 00:22:23 (30 sec),"If you need a photo ID to cash a check or to buy the kind of Sudafed that works, you probably going to need one to go cast a vote in an election. And proof of citizenship too, proof of citizenship. Every time an alien votes, every time an alien votes, it cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen. The Democrats and their socialist friends, they claim they care about voter cancellation or voter suppression, but they don't care about us citizens votes being canceled out."
00:22:23 - 00:22:59 (36 sec),"It's time for other states to require proof of citizenship too, just like Kansas. One more, one more topic. Taxes. Thanks to President Trump, our federal tax burden is much lower. But in Kansas, our state taxes are the highest in the region. It's time to cut our state taxes here in Kansas. When I am governor, the first bill that I want to sign is one that passes along the Trump tax windfall to the people of Kansas."
00:22:59 - 00:23:25 (26 sec),"$137 million. And on top of that, you've got thousands of Kansans being taxed out of their own home because of property tax appraisal increases, they can't afford to live in the home they wanted to retire in. When I am governor we will put a 2$ cap on property tax appraisal increases."
00:23:25 - 00:24:45 (79 sec),"To put it simply, I want to do for Kansas what President Trump has done for America. [Crowd cheering] We've got a big election, a big election ahead of us on November 6th. It's a point of choice, not only for America but a big decision for Kansas. Tonight, President Trump is here calling on us to get out there and vote, calling on us to stand up, the time is now. To stand up for the proven principles and constitutional rights that have made this country great and made this country strong."
00:24:45 - 00:25:08 (23 sec),"And the time is now, that we must reject the political correctness that the progressives and the left are constantly putting on us. And stand up, and stand up for the time-tested values of hard work, faith in God and the United States Constitution. Thank you, President Trump, for making America great again. And now we're going to make Kansas great again."
00:25:08 - 00:25:35 (27 sec),"Thank you. What a job he did for me, I'll tell you, what a job he did. He's going to be a great governor. He will do the job for you. He is going to be a great, great governor. He is a tireless champion for border security. He'll fight for you every single day. He doesn't stop. He'll protect your family, he'll protect your children."
00:25:35 - 00:26:20 (45 sec),"Now his far-left opponent is Laura Kelly. Voted to raise your taxes. And she supports giving public benefits to the illegal aliens [Inaudible. And Laura Kelly earned an F. And never even heard of an F. An F-rating from the NRA. An F. I assume that means that she's not too big on the second amendment, is that way? How would that be? Everybody get out and vote for my friend Kris Kobach on Election Day, please."
00:26:20 - 00:26:34 (14 sec),"Finally, I want to introduce another terrific Republican candidate, your next congressman. Get out and vote. I need him in Washington. Steve Watkins. Steve is a great veteran. He's a patriot, and a proud West Point graduate, that means he's very smart. Steve, come on up."
00:26:34 - 00:27:18 (44 sec),"Hey. Kansans can do anything. I'm proof of that. I. Grew up a couple of miles away. And here I am standing next to the leader of the free world. And not just any leader, a truly great one. You see, when I left -- when I left Kansas I went among other things I spent eight years in war zones, eight years with my boots in the sand of Iraq and Afghanistan."
00:27:18 - 00:27:50 (32 sec),"Eight years. And in all that time -- all that time I really just learned a couple of things, I know for sure that I have seen the devil, but I have also seen fighters, Donald Trump is a fighter. He fights. He fights for America first, he fights to keep our borders secure, he fights for jobs he fights to those [Inaudible] approaching retirement."
00:27:50 - 00:28:53 (63 sec),"He is a fighter and we are so honored to have him here in Kansas. He moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Yes. He likes -- he likes appointing pro-constitution judges to the bench. And he is tough on China, Iran, and North Korea. Do other things, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Now Kansas, Kansas, you know, might be a little partial, but just think how much more he could have accomplished if he were a Kansan."
00:28:53 - 00:29:07 (14 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for all that you do, for Kansas, and for America ,and for this world. We're so glad you're here. Thank you, sir."
00:29:07 - 00:29:30 (23 sec),"Good man. Good man. And a vote for Steve is a vote for me and our agenda to make America great again. You know that agenda. A lot of hats. A vote for Steve's opponent, his name is Paul Davis. He's not good, he's not good, you know that, is a vote for a radical agenda of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the legendary Maxine Waters."
00:29:30 - 00:30:18 (48 sec),"Here in Kansas, his opponent Paul Davis voted time after time to raise your taxes and fees. And he voted to give public benefits to illegal aliens at work. If you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker of the house, Nancy, let Nancy Pelosi. Woah, you better get out and vote for Steve Watkins, please. A majority of House Democrats have already sponsored a socialist takeover of healthcare."
00:30:18 - 00:31:38 (80 sec),The Democrats' plan would eviscerate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for 20 million seniors. We want to protect Medicare we will as Republicans protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it. And we will always protract Americans with pre-existing conditions. We will take care of our great Americans with pre- existing conditions.
00:31:38 - 00:32:40 (63 sec),"Today's Democrats have embraced radical socialism and open borders. If you don't have borders, you don't have a country, folks, you don't have a country. Every single Democrat. In the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders and it's a bill, it's called The Open Borders Bill. What's going on? And it's written by -- Guess who?"
00:32:40 - 00:33:23 (42 sec),"Dianne Feinstein. Remember the leaking, right? The leakin' Dianne Feinstein. ""Did you leak? Did you leak, Dianne? Dianne, did you... "" ""No, no, no, I don't. No.No. I don't think. Wait. Did we leak? No, he said no, no we didn't leak."" Oh. Was that the worst body language you've ever seen? Was that the worst? ""No, I didn't leak. I didn't leak."" No she didn't leak. That's what you're dealing with."
00:33:23 - 00:34:12 (50 sec),"If the Democrats bill ever becomes law, a tidal wave of drugs and crime would pour into our nation like never ever before. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities that release violent predators and bloodthirsty killers like MS-13 into our communities. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens"
00:34:12 - 00:34:57 (45 sec),"And Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE, border patrol, and law enforcement. They wanted the fund ICE. Can you believe it? You know how tough  ICE is? When MS-13 sees ICE coming, they say, ""Let's get out of here."" But you know what? They can't, because they get caught, they get thrown, and they get thrown the hell out of the country. They can't."
00:34:57 - 00:35:37 (39 sec),"They don't like that. The Democrats want to get rid of ICE. So these are great Americans. By the way, ICE, great Americans. They happen to be tough people. I think we need some tough people, they're tough. MS-13 doesn't like ICE and that's why I like ICE. But they really are, they're great Americans, they love our country and they're not treated properly,  they're not treated properly."
00:35:37 - 00:36:00 (24 sec),"I've seen it in Long Island. They go into a community. I've grew up in that vicinity, I know every community out there. And they go into these communities and these are rough,  rough people, MS13, how they even come in and we stop them at the border but there's so many here from before us, from before us, and our laws are so bad and we're getting them changing stuff."
00:36:00 - 00:36:52 (52 sec),"That's why we need more Republicans. But they come in and -- Long Island, we send ICE and they get in there and they get them out, and it's like we're liberating a town. In this day and age it's like in a war, where you know, you're a foreign invader -- a foreign invader, finally, is being taken out. They're liberating a country or liberating a city or town."
00:36:52 - 00:37:42 (50 sec),"These people are liberating these towns, and you know the story, and you've heard it, it's all over. They cut people up because they don't want to use bullets, it's too fast and it's not painful enough. And then when I said. ""Animals!"" Nancy Pelosi said, ""How dare you speak that way about a human being. How dare you.""  Right? This woman just said it to me. She screamed out of the word animal, so how dare you call them."
00:37:42 - 00:38:10 (29 sec),"They're human beings and not -- these are animals folks. These are animals. And we need law enforcement, and we need ICE and we need border patrol. These are great people. And if your community has a problem, don't worry about it just give us a call, we'll take care of it. Democrats are also fighting to give welfare and free healthcare to illegal aliens paid for by you, the American taxpayer. Thank you very much."
00:38:10 - 00:38:33 (22 sec),"Republicans believe that the public benefits must be protected for the truly, needy Americans. Americans that need help, not illegal aliens. If you want safe. If you want a border. If you want America to remain a sovereign great country then you must organize, mobilize, register, and vote Republican."
00:38:33 - 00:38:52 (19 sec),"We need more Republican votes. This election is about safety. And it's also about prosperity. Since the election, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. And we've added nearly one-half million manufacturing jobs. Think of that. If I ever said that during the cam -- look how many. Oh, man, that you are getting more and more people back there."
00:38:52 - 00:39:07 (16 sec),"Look how many reporters. Look. Wow, that's a lot. Wow. Wow. You know I call it? I call it the Academy Awards. That's the  Academy Award. You know we're doing great. Our new polls just came out. I had a poll, Rasmussen 51 or 52, they don't report that, they never report."
00:39:07 - 00:39:49 (41 sec),"But you know -- and It's much higher than that because some people -- I don't know if I'm happy about this, they say when they don't want to talk about it that means they're voting for Trump, I don't know, am I supposed to be thrilled? But we'll take it, right? Well take it. That's what happened in 2016. A lot of people didn't want to talk about it and the pollsters puts it down. OK, so -- but now they learned, they learned their lesson. When they don't talk they had Trump voters."
00:39:49 - 00:40:26 (38 sec),"All action. All action, no talk. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in recorded history. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. By the way, by the way, can you imagine during the debate if I have those stats, the best unemployment number ever for African-Americans. Best in terms of poverty ever in history for Africa."
00:40:26 - 00:41:02 (36 sec),"How do you win? How do you beat us on that? It's only habit. It's habit. Because for a hundred years, African-Americans have gone with Democrats but now they're changing, and they're changing fast and they're coming for us. Thank you, Kanye West. Thank you, Jim Brown. Big Jim Brown. Thank you, Iron Mike. I could go through -- We have so many people."
00:41:02 - 00:42:21 (79 sec),"Big Jim Brown. We could use him right now in the NFL, right? Great people. Hispanic- American and Asian-American, likewise, their unemployment rates have also reached all- time historic lows. The lowest. And women's unemployment just fell to 3.6%,  the lowest rate in 65 years. And we are, as of right now, the world's No.1 producer of crude oil and natural gas. Energy. No. 1.  No. 1. And since I took office, the value of Americans mutual funds and pension funds has increased by $2.7 trillion. That's your money, that's your money. And your 401(k)s. You all look like a bunch of geniuses, thank you, Donald, very much. You're all great investors, right?"
00:42:21 - 00:42:54 (33 sec),"You're all great investors. That's all good. We've picked up 11 -- I would say 10, I was saying seven. We picked up now 11.7% Larry Kudlow said it to me the other day, said, ""Sir, you're a little lower in that number.""  I said, ""Really?"" I was using $10 trillion. It's now $11.7 trillion in worth."
00:42:54 - 00:43:26 (32 sec),"Eleven. You know what that is? And China was catching us rapidly before I became president. And right now we are going so fast, we are the fastest developing country in the world. Can you believe that? Boom. Fastest in the world. [Crowd cheering] And that's why I say, ""We have a midterm coming up, an election."" Historically whoever's president -- I don't know why this works, but whoever's -- I guess people get complacent."
00:43:26 - 00:44:08 (42 sec),"You know, ""Hey, we just won the presidency."" Now two years later we have an election, so they are complacent and then we always win in the next one, which is, as you know, the presidential election. We always... So far I'm dreaming of those candidates. I see those candidates before my eyes."
00:44:08 - 00:44:54 (45 sec),"Every night before I go to sleep, sometimes while I'm sleeping I love them so much. Cory Booker, Pocahontas, Pocahontas. I've got more Indian blood in me than Pocahontas, and I have none, I mean, sadly I have none, but I have more than she does. They said to her, ""Why do you say you're of Indian heritage?"" Well, my mother told my high cheekbones that's the answer."
00:44:54 - 00:45:39 (46 sec),"Do you have any documentation? No, we don't. ""Oh, I see. Your high cheekbones."" Well I have high cheekbones too. Hey, maybe I'm an Indian and I'm going to do very well. But think of it. This is her reason. The whole thing has been [Inaudible] but that's OK. You know what, I want to be careful. I'm taking out so many of these people, I'm hitting them so hard that they're disappearing and I don't want to do that because I make it somebody that's actually good to run against me and that would not be good."
00:45:39 - 00:46:34 (55 sec),"I'll take out all the easy ones and maybe I'll get stuck with somebody that's actually good,  but I don't see any on that side. Well, Sleepy Joe Biden, who -- who ran for president two or three times, you know they say only twice. I think I remember a third time in there. But he had 1% with an arrow pointing left."
00:46:34 - 00:47:23 (50 sec),"That means 1% or less. And then Obama took him off the trash heap while he's one of the people. Remember he challenged me to a fight? ""I'd like to take him behind the bar."" I love that. That would be great. That would not last long. That would not last long. That wouldn't last long. Go like this. He's down. And he'll never get up. He will never get up. He will never get up. Now I got to leave their candidates alone."
00:47:23 - 00:47:42 (18 sec),"Somebody actually said, ""You're hitting these candidates really hard."" He's a non-candidate, you know, Don Mandic. He's a Da Nang Dick. He's Da Nang Dick. That's  Blumenthal. He talked about, ""When I was in Da Nang province in Vietnam and I was fighting up the hill in Minner going left and right of me they're dying."
00:47:42 - 00:48:17 (35 sec),"They're being struck by bullets but I went back to their rescue. I went back and I got them. And then I made a second attempt and bullets are going left and right and over my shoulders and they're hitting my men."" And I used to think, ""Wow, this guy is a pretty brave guy.""  And then I found out he's a fraud. He never was in Vietnam. And he stopped campaigning because there was no way you could win."
00:48:17 - 00:48:58 (41 sec),"No way. And because it's Connecticut, where I guess only a Democrat -- Can you believe this? That's why Connecticut's such a mess right now. Only a Democrat -- Wait, you're going to see, it's a mess. General Electric just moved out. That doesn't help. But Da Nang and Dick and then I see him yesterday talking about a man who's No. 1 at Yale, has like this perfect record."
00:48:58 - 00:49:42 (44 sec),"The most incredible record. One of the reasons I picked him. He's like a perfect person in Da Nang Dick, who -- who said he was a great war hero and he never saw the country. This wasn't like saying, ""Yeah. I was in the army."" This is -- this is the guy that said he was charged up Da Nang. Da Nang province right down Da Nang. He's up that hill and he's taking bullets left and right, and he never saw the place, he was in the reserves cell. Remember that."
00:49:42 - 00:50:07 (25 sec),"And he said, ""I demand honesty."" This is true, exact words. I demand honesty, integrity and I demand that there's no lying going on, and I'm saying, ""Wait a minute."" I said,  ""That's the guy that lied about -- in the worst -- in the history of our country. If you look at it,  he lied. And this is one of the people, how bad."
00:50:07 - 00:50:29 (23 sec),"And then you have the Feinstein and you have all the others and you look at what's going on. You don't want those people in office, folks. You've got to have great Republican. And compare that with what you've seen with John Cornyn, who asked a great question to Dianne and got her a little off base, like you know John Cornyn of Texas."
00:50:29 - 00:50:51 (22 sec),"And Lindsey Graham, who did such a great job. Right. Did a great job. How good was Lindsey? How good was Lindsey? And you know what? He was speaking from the heart. He was speaking. And by the way, took a week but that extra week was a great thing because it showed no corroboration, no nothing. By the way, no nothing. How good was Senator Susan Collins yesterday."
00:50:51 - 00:51:14 (23 sec),"Really, really great. And Chuck Grassley. I'll tell you what, Chuck was great. He's got to be very happy with what we did on trade. Right, Chuck? From Iowa, great state. And Mitch McConnell, how good, how good? He was tough and smart. He was great. He worked hard and we got ourselves the finest legal mind. One of the finest human beings."
00:51:14 - 00:51:46 (32 sec),"And again what his family took. The horror that they had to endure by these people like Blumenthal and Cory Booker who was a disaster as the mayor of Newark New Jersey. What they had to take was a disgrace. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning. All right. Tired of winning. We want to win, win, win. Never get tired of winning. After years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation. you see what's happening."
00:51:46 - 00:52:07 (21 sec),"And I just left the United Nations last week, and I can tell you, and everybody else can tell you, and even the fake news can tell you, America is respected again. To create more jobs and rising wages. Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history by far."
00:52:07 - 00:52:54 (48 sec),"We also passed Veterans Choice, 44 years, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor, and we pay for it so they don't have to wait in line for 25 days, 38 days, 14 days, six days. They go out and they see a private doctor, they get themselves a good doctor. We paid the bill. It's frankly so simple but it took 44 years to get it done."
00:52:54 - 00:53:42 (48 sec),"We got it done. I'm going to getting it done. I'm good at getting it done.Now we also passed, this is 45 years, the VA accountability law to insure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable, you are fired, get out."
00:53:42 - 00:54:07 (25 sec),"And we've secured a record, $700 million and the next year $716 billion to rebuild our military and to give our brave warriors the largest pay raise in almost a decade."
00:54:07 - 00:54:56 (49 sec),"And at my direction, The Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces the space force, a very serious stuff. That's happening quickly, it's very serious, that's where it's at. You know you have to know where it's at. Doesn't sound right, but it's right. That's where it's at."
00:54:56 - 00:55:20 (24 sec),"Both defense and offense that's where it's at. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. You know, before I became president, I looked at what was happening with Iran. They were taken over the Middle East, they were taking Syria. They were taking them."
00:55:20 - 00:56:22 (62 sec),"They were going into Iraq, they were taking everything. Now, they just want to make it, they just want to -- say they have riots in every city. Since I took over that operation, that horrible, horrible deal that was the thick of it. The previous administration gave Iran $150 billion and even crazier, they gave him at $1.8 billion dollars in cash. Cash."
00:56:22 - 00:57:07 (45 sec),"Airplanes. Airplanes full of cash. Fact I got in, I said, ""This is the president of the United States. I actually have the power to give away $1.8 billion in cash?"" You know what the answer is? It's actually no, they don't. What they did there is a disgrace. They gave them 1.8 in order to have a terrible deal."
00:57:07 - 00:57:45 (38 sec),"Well that was a hostage so they paid $1.8 billion. They paid $1.8 billion for hostages. Can you imagine? And we got our hostages back from North Korea, right? Noting. Zero. And we have a good relationship. And who knows what happens? But I think good things happen. No more missile testing, no more rocket testing, no more nuclear testing."
00:57:45 - 00:58:26 (41 sec),"We got the remains of our great, great heroes from 75 years ago back. And they keep coming back. And we got our hostages back. And good things are happening over there. You know what I always say is this, just before we signed the deal with Canada and Mexico, great deal, I said, ""Who knows?"" I never like to say -- how could you say? It's a deal."
00:58:26 - 00:58:56 (30 sec),"Who knows? I like to do -- it takes all the pressure off. Who knows? With North Korea, who knows? But I think we're doing very well. OK? The fake news says, ""Why aren't you going faster?"" I said, Listen, I just got back three months ago, right. I was there with Kim Jong-un. I was there three months ago. Chairman Kim."" They say, ""Why aren't you going faster?"
00:58:56 - 00:59:29 (32 sec),"I said, ""What have people done for 75 years? 75. This is three months."" And one of the Akers said, ""Why has the president given away so much? And I said, ""What have I given? I haven't given anything."" We've got our hostages back for nothing, out of respect. We got our remains back. We got the testing all stopped including the nuclear testing."
00:59:29 - 00:59:54 (26 sec),"I said, ""Tell me what have we given?"" ""Well, ah, ah, you -- you agreed to meet."" Oh, that does cost me very much, I agreed to meet. I like to meet. I like to meet. What the hell we lose by meeting. I asked the previous administration. Now that's what I gave away, I agreed to meet. Can you believe it? These people are sick. I agreed to meet."
00:59:54 - 01:00:25 (31 sec),"Can you imagine how well we do if we actually had fair press? Can you imagine? No, could you imagine? Instead of fake news. I agreed to meet. I'm sorry I agreed to meet. And then they said. right. You know, the rhetoric was extremely tough that first couple of months. And President Obama said at my meeting with him he said, ""The biggest problem we have by far is North Korea."""
01:00:25 - 01:00:42 (17 sec),"They would have gone to war. Millions and millions of people would have been killed. Millions of people. And I said to somebody in their administration. Have you ever talked? Have you ever agreed to meet? Have you ever like sit down and talk? ""Well we haven't thought about."" Oh, I see you're going to war, you're not going to talk."
01:00:42 - 01:01:02 (20 sec),"We'll beat anybody. What we have now coming in, I'm telling you it's the greatest power we've ever had, the greatest power in the world. You know why I have that? Because I don't want to use it. And when you have it, nobody is going to mess with us. OK. Nobody. I don't want to use it. Greatest power in the world."
01:01:02 - 01:01:33 (31 sec),"$716 billion, greatest power in the world. But we're doing great. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. That's the other story I tell. That's the other story we tell. That's a big one. That's a big, big story. You know why? Because other presidents all said, there are many, many presidents, ""We're going to do it. We're going to do it."""
01:01:33 - 01:01:44 (10 sec),"Then the pressure goes on and they don't do it. And I see why, I don't blame them. Every leader called me, ""Don't do it, please. Don't do it, don't do it."" You know the story I refused to take their phone calls."
01:01:44 - 01:02:05 (21 sec),"I said, ""Tell them I'll call them back on Thursday next week."" And I'm signing like on Wednesday. Tell him I'm calling him back on Thursday. I look forward to speaking to him. I signed the deal. Now's the deal, then I call him back. ""Yeah. Hi. How are you doing?  What's up?"" Wow. ""We wanted to talk to you about Israel but it's a little late."""
01:02:05 - 01:02:32 (27 sec),"And the embassy, which was going to cost over a billion dollars, we built it for about $400,000, right, you know that, right. And the billion would have taken probably 20 years before you ever got to build it. And we took a piece of land that we own, already own, and it had a building on it. OK building. We fixed the building up a little bit."
01:02:32 - 01:02:51 (19 sec),"We took the big space in the corner. We used even Jerusalem stone, which is a very expensive if you're a building. Jerusalem stone is beautiful. How nice is that? And you know Jerusalem stone in Jerusalem sounds about right. We got it for the right price. And we built it for less than $500,000. Now think of it."
01:02:51 - 01:03:30 (39 sec),"And we opened it up and it's open now, we have our embassy. So we saved a billion dollars in twenty years and we have our embassy. We could do that with hundreds of this. For years you watched as your leaders apologize for America and now you have a president who is standing up for America. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Kansas and we're standing proudly."
01:03:30 - 01:04:29 (58 sec),"We're standing proudly for our great national anthem, right. I just helped Canada and the NFL make a deal that they've been trying to make for years. Can you believe it? Canada was taking advantage of the NFL. The NFL couldn't get it done. It took me about two seconds because it's pea -- It's, you know, it's a lot of money but it's not compared to corn, and crops, and dairy, and milk, and cars, and steel, and everything else. It's peanuts. I say you got to take care of it right. Because I want to help American companies. It took me like two minutes and we get it done. And I got a call from the commissioner of the NFL and I thought he was calling me to ask me to stop haunting them about standing for the American flag and for our national.."
01:04:29 - 01:05:05 (36 sec),"And he didn't. He called me to thank me. He said, ""The previous administration could not get it done. And you got it done. We didn't even know what you were trying to do it."" So now they'll have a lot more money to give to their players and their players will still hate me, but that's OK. Stand for it, just as long as they stand. Just as long as they stand for our flag and our anthem I don't care how they feel about that."
01:05:05 - 01:05:33 (28 sec),"But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends your family your neighbors your co-workers and get out and vote Republican, we need more people in D.C.. We don't have enough. Vote to send Kris Kobach to the governor's mansion and vote to send Steve Watkins to Congress. We always vote for Trump."
01:05:33 - 01:06:01 (28 sec),"A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products made right here in the USA. Finally, finally. We want it made here. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement, and that's what they are. They're our heroes."
01:06:01 - 01:06:31 (30 sec),"And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division,  and destruction, and to reclaim America's true heritage and righteous destiny. We're losing that with these crazy loco people. To everyone in this room tonight, that's a lot of people, to every citizen watching across our land."
01:06:31 - 01:07:04 (33 sec),This is your time to choose. It's a time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustration of the past or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. It's not up to the media. It's not up to the pundits. It's up to you to decide your fate.
01:07:04 - 01:07:18 (14 sec),"And remember this, what happened in 2016, and what's happening even more so now, I believe, because I've produced, and people see I produced, one of them said, ""He made a lot of promises and he actually produced more than he made promises."""
01:07:18 - 01:07:51 (33 sec),"I mean, you know, think about it. I did. I did. You have the power with your vote. To defend your family, your community, your country, and everything we hold sacred, and righteous, and true. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to every day great American patriots."
01:07:51 - 01:08:20 (30 sec),"The state of Kansas was set up by tough pioneer men and strong women, who defied danger and brave the wilderness to build a beautiful life on the plains. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Strong Women, strong women, strong."
01:08:20 - 01:08:52 (31 sec),"I'm sorry, fellas, stronger than the men, I'm sorry, fellas. Strong. They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury but they all had one thing in common, they love their families, they love their country, and they loved their god."
01:08:52 - 01:09:29 (37 sec),"These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud and great American heritage. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children we are going to work, we are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win."
01:09:29 - 01:10:13 (44 sec),"We will not ban. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people. One Family. And one glorious nation under God."
01:10:13 - 01:10:42 (28 sec),"And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kansas. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:00:43 (43 sec),"That's right, USA. And hello, Kentucky. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in the heartland with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots. In just 24 days, the people of Kentucky -- we love Kentucky -- greatest horses in the world and plenty of other things -- are going to elect an incredible slate of Republican candidates to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and continue making America great again."
00:00:43 - 00:01:36 (54 sec),"Just hours ago, we celebrated another tremendous victory for the American people. You know what I'm talking about. We're having a lot of victories, folks. Can you handle it? In the Oval Office of the White House, I welcomed home Pastor Andrew Brunson, great man, from Turkey. He is now free from jail. Think of that, 35-year jail sentence, 35 years."
00:01:36 - 00:02:07 (31 sec),"Not anymore. He's back with his family, together with his wife, and he is on American soil. And it's a beautiful family. They're all together. And I want to thank President Erdogan of Turkey. He was -- he was terrific. We all worked together. It wasn't easy. It wasn't easy. That one wasn't easy. And we don't pay ransom."
00:02:07 - 00:02:45 (38 sec),"We don't pay ransom. But I do -- I want to thank the president. I want to thank the people of Turkey. And I think we'll probably now really establish a terrific relationship with Turkey. We appreciate it. This evening, in the wake of Hurricane Michael, our thoughts are with our fellow citizens in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia."
00:02:45 - 00:03:37 (52 sec),"They got hit hard. They got hit hard, especially when you look at -- when you look at Florida, did you ever see anything like that? And you look at Georgia, Georgia got hit hard. That was some wind force. Up to 200 miles -- almost 200 miles an hour, one of the most vicious we've ever been hit with. So I just want to thank all of those incredible people, the people of FEMA, the first responders... law enforcement, and all of the thousands of federal employees and National Guard, all of the personnel, they're now on the ground, they're supporting this really major recovery."
00:03:37 - 00:04:00 (23 sec),"I will say, you have thousands of electrical trucks all lined up, they're following in, they're getting the roads cleared, not easy. And they have done some job. You had 600,000 people without electric. In one day, they got it down to 250,000. That's some job, one day. And we will not rest until the job is done."
00:04:00 - 00:04:42 (42 sec),"We're here tonight to discuss everything we have accomplished together in less than two years' time. Think of it. Think of it. And I'm here tonight, although I've been back many times, I love this state... to thank the people of Kentucky for 2016. We didn't have to wait too long for that. We didn't have to wait too long for that."
00:04:42 - 00:05:16 (33 sec),"Remember, the vote is in, the polls have closed in Kentucky, Donald Trump is the winner of Kentucky. That was fast. That was fast. And to make sure that America's extraordinary comeback, we want to make sure it continues full speed ahead. We don't want Democrats... that are coming from a different place, we don't want them getting in office."
00:05:16 - 00:06:27 (71 sec),"All they'll do is abstract. Under Republican leadership, America is booming. It's thriving. America is winning again because we are finally putting America first. [Audience chants USA] Our country's unemployment rate has just fallen to 3.7 percent, the lowest in over 50 years. Fifty years. Median household income has reached an all-time high."
00:06:27 - 00:06:57 (30 sec),"That's pretty good. It means you're making more money than you've ever made before. I don't know how much better, but we're going to get it up higher. We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And some of you will love this, and I'm proud of it, these are great people, it's a great resource when properly used."
00:06:57 - 00:07:39 (42 sec),"We have ended the war on clean, beautiful coal. We're putting our miners back to work like never before. They're going back, back, back. And after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. And we are doing it with American iron, aluminum, and look at what happened to steel."
00:07:39 - 00:08:10 (30 sec),"You see the comeback with steel? Everyone's going back to work. The steel mills are opening up, U.S. Steel, Nucor. They're all opening up their steel mills. That was faster than I thought. And we're stopping the dumping. And if they want to dump, they can but they got to pay a lot. So if you think about it, so true, despite our size, America is now the hottest country anywhere in the world."
00:08:10 - 00:08:42 (32 sec),"This is where people want to be. Since my election, we've picked up in worth $11.7 trillion. Think of that. Think of it. And we are going to get along great with China, but we're doing things with China, and they've dropped about $20 trillion. But you know what? They're going to be just fine, but they have to treat us fairly."
00:08:42 - 00:09:42 (61 sec),"They have to treat us fairly. Right? That's right. And every day, we are living by our motto, promises made, promises kept. [Audience Chants Trump] And you look back there at the fake news media, look at them. Look at them. It's like the Academy Awards every time. You know, I'd like to walk into a place one night and not have any of these guys."
00:09:42 - 00:10:09 (27 sec),"Boy. It gets bigger and bigger. But even they have said that President Trump, and you know they probably get fired the next day, that President Trump made promises during the campaign, and I've actually produced more than the promises I made. How often do you hear that? And we all produced it together. We have incredible people."
00:10:09 - 00:10:30 (21 sec),"Mitch and Rand, and we all produced it together. We have a great team. But we need more of them. We need more Republican votes. We have a majority that's essentially, Rand, not a majority. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority, right? So we have to get some more Republicans in there, and we're here for some good ones tonight."
00:10:30 - 00:10:55 (25 sec),"On Monday night at the White House, we kept one of the biggest and most historic promises of all. Do you know what we're talking about, right? Never has a man been treated so badly. America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. A great, great gentleman."
00:10:55 - 00:11:55 (60 sec),"What happened to him was so unfair. I've never seen anything like it. And we stuck with him all the way because we knew the facts. We stuck with him all the way. And Rand Paul and Mitch, they stuck with him. No doubts about it. No doubts. Remember that. Remember that. He now sits alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch to defend your sacred rights and your God-given freedom."
00:11:55 - 00:12:42 (47 sec),"What the crazy, radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh is a national disgrace. From the moment Brett Kavanaugh was known, well, you know what happened. We announced the name, we nominated him, and literally from the moment he was nominated, they didn't even know. It's actually, if you think of it, it's from before he was nominated, nobody knew anything about who it was going to be. I didn't even make my decision yet, and they started saying horrible things about whoever the person might be. They were on a mission to obstruct, resist, delay, demolish, and destroy."
00:12:42 - 00:13:16 (34 sec),"The Democrats have become totally consumed by their chilling lust for power. And I'll tell you something, we have a man, one of the most powerful men in the world, it's OK, comes from Kentucky, that's not bad. Got to respect that. And he heard about this, he says I want to be there. He's one of yours. He's joining us tonight."
00:13:16 - 00:13:51 (35 sec),"He's rock-ribbed Kentucky leader. He's been a leader for a long time. There's nobody tougher. There's nobody smarter. He refused to cave to the radical Democrats' shameful campaign of political and personal destruction. He stared down, tough cookie -- I know tough people, he's tough, he's Kentucky tough, which is about as tough... He stared down the angry left-wing mob."
00:13:51 - 00:13:56 (5 sec),"He never blinked, and he never looked back, and he got us a man who will be one of our great, great Supreme Court justices, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Come up here."
00:13:56 - 00:14:11 (15 sec),"Thank you, Kentucky. Aren't we proud of President Trump? Let me just add, thanks to President Trump and a Republican Senate, 84 new federal judges already this Congress. That's already a record, Mr. President. Keep sending them our way and we'll keep confirming them and change the court system forever. Thank you for being here."
00:14:11 - 00:15:36 (85 sec),"Thank you. And Mitch is a true fighter for Kentucky. He loves this state. And you know, we'll be running together in 2020. That will be a lot of fun. Thank you, Mitch. On this Election Day, November 6th, every American faces a simple choice. You can either vote for Democrat mob rule or you can vote for a Republican Party that stands proudly for law and order, fairness, freedom, and justice."
00:15:36 - 00:16:20 (44 sec),"Simple as that. If Nancy Pelosi... crying Chuck Schumer, and the radical Democrats take over Congress, they will try to raise your taxes, they will immediately restore job-killing regulations, they will impose, believe it or not, socialism, take away your health care, your health care and your whole life will be unaffordable, shut down immediately, oh, forget this one, shut down your coal mines in about two minutes."
00:16:20 - 00:16:49 (29 sec),"You see what's going on with the Second Amendment? They will destroy your Second Amendment. And the Democrats want to open our borders to a flood of deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The fact is, Democrats have become the party of crime. They have. Republicans are the party of safety, and we are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs."
00:16:49 - 00:17:25 (36 sec),"And we're thrilled to be joined this evening by several terrific Kentucky Republicans. First of all, Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? Thank you. Congressman Tom Massie. They've got them spread all over the place. Where's Tom? Doing a great job, thank you. They're doing a great job."
00:17:25 - 00:18:27 (62 sec),"Congressman Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Congressman James Comer, James Comer. Thanks, James. James, the whole group, they have been incredible, I'll tell you what. We got tax cuts, biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. We got so many other things. ANWR. We got rid of the individual mandate. We had Obamacare repealed and replaced."
00:18:27 - 00:19:08 (41 sec),"We didn't get one Democrat vote, but we'll get it done. We had a little disappointment that night. A little bit of a disappointment. But it's essentially done anyway, because when you get rid of the mandate, the individual mandate, it's done. And what we have done with the remnants of Obamacare is we've kept your premiums down far below what anybody would have thought, through good management, through Secretary Alex Azar."
00:19:08 - 00:19:40 (32 sec),"Now a friend of mine who has helped us so much, he's really smart, but I have to say his wife, the last couple of days, has become maybe the biggest star in the family. She's been so -- I said, Rand, you have to get her on television more. She's become the biggest star in the family. Yes. A man that really has been a friend of mine, a special friend, and he's really something."
00:19:40 - 00:20:15 (35 sec),"He's a great guy. Not everybody knows that, believe it or not. Not -- it's like Mitch, not everybody knows that Mitch is a great guy. These are great people. There's something that happens to you when you grow up in Kentucky, I guess, right? These are great people. But, you know, I call Rand a senator of tremendous common sense."
00:20:15 - 00:20:25 (9 sec),"That's a great compliment, common sense. And you know what? Hey, Rand, he's young, he's spry, run up here for a second, Rand. Come up here, Rand."
00:20:25 - 00:21:12 (47 sec),"The president said he's tired. I could take 20 or 30 minutes, right? Now, I'm going to tell you a very quick story about the president, and this shows how he's different than any politician and why you're all out here. I went to him with an idea on health care. I said, let's let individuals buy it in a group."
00:21:12 - 00:21:34 (22 sec),"Let them join an association. Let competition drive prices down. The president said, it's a great idea. What did he staff say? Oh, no, we could never do that. What did all the middle managers say? Oh, we could never do that. And you know what the president said? Make it so. And he did it."
00:21:34 - 00:22:21 (47 sec),"But it's true. We were talking about health care and Rand had this concept that -- he was so far advanced, even the experts didn't know, and after they checked, they said, you know, he's right. He's right. Association health care, where you can team up with other companies, you can team up -- you go in, you get phenomenal pricing, you have no problems with crossing borders, so you get every insurance company, and it's taken off, Rand, and that was Rand's initial idea."
00:22:21 - 00:22:49 (28 sec),"That's true. And it's doing really well. Inexpensive and terrific. And another man, a very special friend of mine, he was a great businessman, decided to win and run in Kentucky. By the way, does that sound familiar? This guy was a really successful guy and he saw things happening in Kentucky, and he said, you know, I can do a tremendous job, and he really has done."
00:22:49 - 00:23:15 (26 sec),"And he doesn't want to be political. He wants to get the job done. This state is doing so well. You have your lowest unemployment numbers in history. You have your best incomes in history. You have jobs and companies flowing back in. And all of that wouldn't matter if I didn't like him, because if I didn't like him, I'd say, forget about him, right?"
00:23:15 - 00:23:59 (44 sec),"But I like him a lot. He's a terrific man and a terrific governor, Matt Bevin. Thank you, Matt. Thanks, Matt. So we're here for a truly special guy. These are all special people. Something about this place. Boy, did we win by a lot. What did we win by, 38? Thirty-eight. We won by a lot. I have a feeling that Mitch McConnell in two years is going to do very good, very good."
00:23:59 - 00:24:16 (17 sec),"He's going to do very good. You know, he goes down as the greatest leader, in my opinion, in history. What we've done is incredible together. But he's better when I'm president than he ever was when anyone else was president. Doing much better. But I want to introduce the leader that we're all here for tonight."
00:24:16 - 00:25:01 (45 sec),"And all of our congressmen know exactly what I'm talking about. He has been so strong on all of the things that we stand for, tax cuts, regulation cuts. Every single event that we passed, and it's record numbers of events, he's been at the forefront, and he's got a little bit of a tough race with a Nancy Pelosi-picked figure."
00:25:01 - 00:25:19 (18 sec),"And I guess they did a little changing, and they did a lot of this and that, the Democrats do, that's the only way they can win. But I'll tell you what, I've seen the -- you know, outside, you have 25,000, 35,000, some crazy number of people, and we set up movie screens. We set up beautiful movie screens."
00:25:19 - 00:25:47 (27 sec),"And to those people outside, we love you. We love you. You have to see the lines, they go all the way back, many miles. But a lot of them stayed and they're watching screens outside. I like your location better, do you agree? But this is a special guy, and normally I wouldn't make a trip, but here I have two reasons."
00:25:47 - 00:26:20 (33 sec),"One was I love the state of Kentucky. And the other was that Andy Barr is a great congressman. Andy, come on up. [Audience Chants Andy]"
00:26:20 - 00:27:07 (47 sec),"Mr. President, welcome to Kentucky's Sixth Congressional District. A swing district that two years ago, you sent a message to the nation because you won it by 15 points. And welcome to Madison County, a county, Mr. President, that you won by a whopping 32 points. Home of Eastern Kentucky University, where we are right now, the most pro-veteran university in America."
00:27:07 - 00:27:50 (42 sec),"Home to workers who relocated from Eastern Kentucky, who value a paycheck to put food on the table, and, Mr. President, thank you for ending the war on coal. And Madison County, home of the Department of Criminal Justice Training, the Kentucky State Police, two awesome police departments, and Democrat Sheriff Mike Coyle, the sheriff of the year, who says, Mr. President, to keep the drugs out of our communities, we need to build the wall."
00:27:50 - 00:28:28 (38 sec),"[Audience Chants Build the Wall] And when I first met you -- when I first met you, Mr. President, I told you about our drug problem in Kentucky, and you listened. And six months later, I was in the White House with you when you declared a national public health emergency to fight the drug epidemic, the opioid epidemic."
00:28:28 - 00:29:09 (40 sec),"And we worked together and we funded the most significant investment to fight a drug crisis in American history. This president is a man of action. A man of action. Other people resist, but this president gets results. And so I want to turn it over to him, but I just want to remember one special night two years ago in Cleveland, the moment I knew this man would be the next president of the United States."
00:29:09 - 00:29:31 (22 sec),"Remember? Remember what he said. He said that my opponent has a slogan, and that slogan is I'm with her. Remember what he said next? What he said was, I have a different slogan, and that slogan is: I'm with you, the American people. Mr. President, I'm with you to fight for the American people!"
00:29:31 - 00:30:12 (41 sec),"Thank you. That's pretty good. Now, you know, the one thing that Andy didn't say is that she paid a lot of money for that slogan. And the morning after I came up with my little feel on it, they changed the slogan. It was gone. It was gone. But we weren't gone, because this was the single greatest movement in the history of American politics."
00:30:12 - 00:30:28 (16 sec),"And our slogan was a great slogan. I think it's the greatest slogan that anybody will ever come up with. Although in two years, we have a new one, you know what that is. Ours is make America great again. Look at all these hats. And at the rate we're going, it's going to happen fast, it's called keep America great."
00:30:28 - 00:31:10 (42 sec),"It's got to be that. Right? So I'm here for Andy Barr. And that's a vote for safe communities, strong borders, and Kentucky values. Andy Barr. A vote for Andy's opponent, I had to do a little checking, who's he running against? Who? This is an extreme liberal named Amy McGrath. Chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, that's a real beauty... and the radical Democrat mob."
00:31:10 - 00:31:51 (41 sec),"Now, Amy supports a socialist takeover of your health care, which by the way means your taxes are going to triple if you're lucky. She supports open borders. She needs the tax hikes to cover the through-the-roof garbage that you want no part of. And she wants to immediately decimate your now-thriving coal industry."
00:31:51 - 00:32:30 (39 sec),"So if you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker of the House -- no, we can't do that. That will not be good. Then you have to get out and vote for Andy Barr, a great man. Great man. You know, actually, I must tell you, Kentucky, you're always involved at the middle of politics. The election of Andy is a very important thing, could make the difference between unbelievable continued success and, frankly, failure, where we fight for two more years with these people, with these obstructionists."
00:32:30 - 00:33:14 (44 sec),"So it's really an important race. It could be the congressman up -- I don't know if they're worried about them. They're so far ahead in their races. We don't have to talk about them anymore, right? We don't have to talk about them. We don't have to talk about them, but we were talking backstage, and they said it. This could be the most important race there is. So get out and vote."
00:33:14 - 00:34:03 (49 sec),"We can't let this happen. A majority of House Democrats have already signed up for socialist health care. By the way, it doesn't work anywhere in the world. Just so you understand. It doesn't work. It's good if you don't mind waiting like five weeks to see a doctor. They come from socialist countries. Frankly, they come from Canada, because they want to use our doctors."
00:34:03 - 00:34:57 (54 sec),"They come from all over the world. And we're making it now better. And they want to destroy everything that's been built, all of that great foundation. They want to outlaw the private insurance plans of 2.4 million Kentucky residents. And some of those plans are fantastic and inexpensive. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for nearly 250,000 Kentucky seniors who depend on it. Republicans want to protect Medicare, and we will, for our great seniors who have earned it and who have paid for it. And Republicans only will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions."
00:34:57 - 00:35:32 (35 sec),"We're going to protect it. The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and it's open borders. Democrats want to abolish ICE and they want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and MS-13 thugs. And don't kid yourself, that's what's going to happen. And they want to get rid of ICE."
00:35:32 - 00:35:56 (23 sec),"They think ICE isn't nice. Did you ever see what they're dealing with? First of all, they're incredible patriots. They have a job that nobody in this group wants. They go in there and they meet the most vile, most vicious people on earth like it's a day at the office. You don't want to do it. You don't want to -- yeah, you might do it. This guy might do it. You want a job?"
00:35:56 - 00:36:25 (29 sec),"I'll get it to you with a -- look at this guy, this guy will do it. I'm looking at -- he might do it. You might do it. But you don't want to do it. They go in there and they liberate towns. These people came in by the thousands, and we're taking them out by the thousands. They're getting out. They're getting out."
00:36:25 - 00:37:01 (36 sec),"Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans -- and you know this, you know this -- Republicans stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. You know that. One by one, we are finding the illegal alien criminals, predators, drug dealers, MS-13 killers, and we are sending them back home."
00:37:01 - 00:37:31 (30 sec),"We are liberating America's cities and towns. That's what we're doing. The only immigration policy Democrats support is catch and release. How about that one? You catch a criminal thug, you take their name, and then you release them, say please show up in five years to court. Now, number one, it's ridiculous."
00:37:31 - 00:38:04 (34 sec),"Number two, they never show up. What a mess. We have the dumbest immigration laws in the world. The world laughs at us, but we're getting them changed. We need some more Republicans. We need some votes. And if you elect Republicans this November, we will pass legislation to end catch and release. We will -- I'll tell you, have you heard the other one?"
00:38:04 - 00:38:42 (38 sec),"Right? Lottery. Lottery. Lottery. OK? Names, you pick them out, coming to the United States. Now, let me ask you, these countries set up lotteries. Do you really believe they're giving us their finest? No. This is a lottery. This was Chuck Schumer's special deal for this country. And we need to elect people so we get rid of it. We got -- maybe just get rid of it. How crazy."
00:38:42 - 00:39:15 (33 sec),"How crazy. How -- and then you have chain migration. You know what that is, right? So we had a man, horrible person, the west side in Manhattan, where I live, where I love, right along the Hudson River. He's driving a car down this roadway where the speed limit is 35. He's going about 70. And he decides to make a right turn into a beautiful park that goes along the river with lots of people."
00:39:15 - 00:39:43 (28 sec),"Many people were killed. Nobody ever talks about the people that were horribly injured. They lost legs, they lost arms. These are people that were running. They want to keep themselves in shape. They were working out. They were walking hand-in-hand together. They're dead. They're horribly wounded. Many will never, ever recover."
00:39:43 - 00:40:14 (31 sec),"Now, what happens? What happened to him? It will be years of litigation. He came in, and then he took chain migration, and he brought his mother, and his father, and his brother, and his sister, and his aunt, and his grandfather. None of them working. It ended up being approximately 22 people who came in. It's called a chain."
00:40:14 - 00:40:59 (45 sec),"Isn't that wonderful? A chain. And we're stuck with them. We're stuck with these people. And I don't want a chain. I want people to come into our country on a merit-based system. And I want them to help all of the great companies that are moving back into the United States. They're moving to Michigan, they're moving to Ohio, they're moving to Pennsylvania, they're moving to North and South Carolina."
00:40:59 - 00:41:25 (26 sec),"They're coming in. They're moving to Florida. And, yes, they're moving into Kentucky. And with what we've done, we've become so successful that we need people to come in with all these companies that are coming in. But we want great people that love our country, that respect our country, and that want to work."
00:41:25 - 00:42:09 (43 sec),"This election is about safety and it is about prosperity. Since the last election -- and these are numbers that the fakers back there, the fake news, would never have allowed me to say. They'd never in a million years, if I ever said this during the campaign, they would've had headlines. We've created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps."
00:42:09 - 00:42:41 (33 sec),"You know what that means? The second, food stamps. It means, number one, we get rid of an unbelievable cost. You wouldn't even believe it. But you know what else? You got a lot of happy people that are working. It's a great thing. It's a great thing. We've added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing's never going to come back?"
00:42:41 - 00:43:16 (34 sec),"Never going to come back, remember? The previous administration, oh, you think that's going to happen? You'd need a magic wand. Well, I guess we had the magic wand. We had the magic wand. And these are great jobs and these are important jobs. Manufacturing jobs, companies pouring back in. Manufacturing. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded in history."
00:43:16 - 00:43:59 (43 sec),"African-American poverty has reached its lowest level in history. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history. I can't believe I'm still saying this. I am so sorry, I apologize to the women in the room. Remember, I got 52 percent -- remember, they kept saying, he's not -- the fake news -- that's right."
00:43:59 - 00:44:43 (44 sec),"Remember he said -- they were all saying he will not do well with women? Wow, did we do well with women. Did we do well. Fake news. We did really well with women. But, unfortunately, the women's unemployment, Mitch, is not at a historic low. It's only the best number in 65 years. We let down women. We let down women."
00:44:43 - 00:45:12 (30 sec),"Sixty-five years, 3.6 percent. As the charts grow just a little bit, it will be historic very soon. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning. You know about winning. You really know about winning. Those horses win. You people are winners. I'm just afraid that Kentucky is winning too much."
00:45:12 - 00:45:40 (28 sec),"[Audience calls out No] You're going to send Matt Bevin to see Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, and they're going to all come to the Oval Office to see me, and they're going to say, Mr. President, we can't do it anymore. Kentucky is winning too much. They can't do it. They don't like it. They don't want to do it anymore."
00:45:40 - 00:46:07 (27 sec),"They're going to say, we're winning so much, we just can't stand it. I'm going to say, Mitch and Matt and Rand, I'm sorry. We're going to keep winning. We're going to win more and more and more. We're going to keep winning. I'm sorry, folks. And I will send them happily back to Kentucky. You're winning a lot."
00:46:07 - 00:46:44 (37 sec),"We won today. We won today with the great pastor, Pastor Brunson. Last week, I announced that we are replacing the horror show, one of the worst trade deals ever made, known as NAFTA, with an incredible, brand-new U.S. Mexico-Canada agreement called the USMCA, USMCA. And even the Democrats are saying, wow, what a good deal that is. They can't believe it. We actually, Mitch, get bipartisan support."
00:46:44 - 00:47:21 (37 sec),"Can you believe it? Although, if it's too good, they won't support it. That's the problem. No, I will say, even Chuck Schumer liked it. Can you believe that one? He said that's a good deal. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices. China -- and I have great respect for China, we all do, and I have great respect and like him for President Xi, the absolute head -- this is an absolute head of China."
00:47:21 - 00:48:03 (42 sec),"But you know what? They've been making $300 billion to $500 billion a year, taking it out of our country. We have rebuilt China. And I don't blame China. They can get away -- I blame our past leaders, because they should never have let it happen. I don't blame China. And thanks to our strong trade and economic policies, Brady Industries recently broke ground on a new billion-dollar aluminum mill that will create up to 1,500 jobs right next to Ashland, Kentucky."
00:48:03 - 00:48:37 (34 sec),"You know where we're talking about, right? Right? Ashland. Under Republican leadership, we also passed the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. Bigger than any have ever been passed. We have taken historic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. You saw three weeks ago, Pfizer, Novartis, a lot of drug companies announced a very substantial increase."
00:48:37 - 00:49:07 (30 sec),"Then I said to Secretary Alex Ocasa -- and I said to Alex Azar, this is no good. This is no good. We got to do something. I want to call them. And I called the head of Pfizer, big company -- I guess like the biggest -- big, big drug company. I called Novartis. I called the heads of these companies, and they said, sir, sir, we will immediately drop the price back to where it was."
00:49:07 - 00:49:35 (28 sec),"Did you ever hear of that? And Rand Paul, it's the first time I realized how powerful it was to be the president of the United States. No, they -- they reduced -- now, I -- and by the way, I kid, but I do, I respect that they did that. I really appreciate it. And now because of what Secretary Azar is doing, you're going to see drug pricing, prescription drugs going down."
00:49:35 - 00:50:04 (29 sec),"You know, we have countries -- we have countries on this planet, the exact same pill, the exact same prescription, made in the exact same factory or plant, in Canada and in other countries all over the world, is much less, sometimes 50 percent, sometimes more than that, it's much less than what Americans pay."
00:50:04 - 00:50:40 (36 sec),"We're getting rid of the middleman. We're doing a number -- I'm going to be hated so much by some people in this country that made a fortune. But we're getting drug prices way down. And we started it last Friday with the signing of two bills. And something that the congressman really helped me with, all of them in the room and Andy, in particular, we help right now get critically ill, terminal patients access to life-saving treatments."
00:50:40 - 00:51:08 (27 sec),"We just passed right to try. Right to try. I hope nobody has to use it in this room. But this is a person who's terminally ill -- we have the greatest drug companies and the greatest research in the world by far, nobody close. But we have a pipeline that would take 12 to 15 years to get it approved and through the pipeline."
00:51:08 - 00:51:32 (25 sec),"We have that down, I think, to four years and maybe less, but we have to be careful. But if we had something that really showed great promise toward a problem that somebody had, who's terminally ill, for 44 years, they've been trying to get this passed. They couldn't. Not as easy as it sounds. Between the insurance companies, the liabilities, the country itself, the lawsuits."
00:51:32 - 00:51:58 (26 sec),"So I got everybody in a room, we got to get life -- this is really important stuff. Excuse me, how many of you know friends? If they have money, they travel all over the world, begging and looking for a cure. They want hope. If they don't have money, they go home, they have no hope. And we got right to try passed a month-and-a-half ago and already it's had an incredible impact."
00:51:58 - 00:52:36 (38 sec),"Incredible impact, 44 years. So now a patient is terminally ill, we have something that's looking really good, we make them sign a document, very important document, and they go in and we work with them and we see if we can help them. And we've had some incredible results already. So I just want to thank Andy Barr and all of the congressmen here and Mitch and Rand, because we got it passed."
00:52:36 - 00:53:17 (40 sec),"We got it passed. But to me that was a big thing. Many, many, many years they worked on it, they couldn't get it done. We also passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor instead of waiting online for 12 days, for 24 days, for 38 days. We have our great veterans -- we're doing a great job with our veterans -- we have our -- but this was one of the most important things -- because they'd be waiting in line for sometimes months if you can believe it. We had people waiting in line and they weren't very sick."
00:53:17 - 00:53:41 (24 sec),"By the time they saw a doctor, they were terminally ill. Now, if there's a line, if there's a way, because we have great doctors in the V.A. That's one thing we -- I'll tell you, everybody tells me. You can't get to them. Now, if there's a wait, you go to a local doctor, you get yourself taken care of, and we pay for the bill."
00:53:41 - 00:54:09 (28 sec),"We pay for the bill. That was another one. That was another one. Took over 40 years. I used to say to people, why don't we do that? I thought I was so smart. I said, listen, I got a great idea. These lines are terrible, 28 days, 30 days. I got a great idea. It's the greatest idea I think I've ever had. We're going to have them go to a private doctor instead of waiting on line."
00:54:09 - 00:54:49 (41 sec),"Sir, we've been trying to get that passed for 40 years. Oh, you've heard about it before? Everybody heard -- they couldn't get it passed. But we're going at getting things passed. We got it passed. Rand and Mitch and Andy, we got it passed. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable."
00:54:49 - 00:55:29 (40 sec),"Jim, you mistreated our veteran, Jim. Jim, you're fired, get out. We just secured $700 billion and $716 billion, two years, to fully rebuild the American military. Bigger, stronger, more powerful than ever before, and we are giving our warriors their largest pay raise in over a decade. And at my direction -- and we need Rand and we need Mitch's help, but it's really popular -- let them know how popular this is -- you know, it's all about space."
00:55:29 - 00:55:48 (19 sec),"It's all about space. Defense, offense, everything, it's going to soon be all about space. So let Rand and Mitch know about this. Ready? At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces known as the Space Force. Now they have to do it. I put them on the spot."
00:55:48 - 00:56:23 (35 sec),"I put them on the spot. Now, they have to do it. No, it's very popular. One of the biggest applause I get wherever I go is when I talk about the Space Force. And, by the way, China, already started. Russia, already started. They've got to start, but we have the greatest people in the world. We make the greatest equipment in the world."
00:56:23 - 00:56:54 (31 sec),"We make the greatest rockets and missiles and tanks and ships in the world. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. You know, when I came to office, weeks before I was given rundowns of what's happening, and Iran was just a question of when will they take over the entire Middle East?"
00:56:54 - 00:57:13 (19 sec),"They're not thinking about that anymore, folks. They're not thinking about it anymore. They've got a little disaster going. They have riots in the street. Their currency is shot. And they'll be coming to us some day, probably not too far out, and they'll say we'd like to make a deal. And that's fine. That's good."
00:57:13 - 00:58:05 (51 sec),"But a real deal. Not the joke of a deal that was made by the past administration. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Right? Together we have made extraordinary progress, but we're just getting started. If you vote to elect Republican House and Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes very, very substantially."
00:58:05 - 00:58:57 (52 sec),"We, unlike the Democrats, will protect Medicare and protect Social Security. Remember what I said during the debates? We will protect them. We will defend your Second Amendment and protect your right to free speech and religious liberty. With your help, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, and all of the people that work so well with us will continue to confirm incredible pro-Constitution judges, not radical far-left judges who will rewrite your Constitution and replace your Kentucky values."
00:58:57 - 00:59:17 (20 sec),"Not going to happen. Eighty-four judges -- think of that, it's a record -- it's a record -- and we actually have a lot to go, 84 judges approved. What a difference. Going to be, by the time we finish, maybe 50 percent of the court. Do you know what that is? Fifty percent. We will fully secure the border."
00:59:17 - 00:59:55 (39 sec),"We will pass Kate's law, stop sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery, end chain migration, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity."
00:59:55 - 01:00:39 (43 sec),"But to achieve this future, to continue the greatest movement in the history of our country and maybe of any country, you need to vote Republican. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for the great people of Kentucky."
01:00:39 - 01:01:28 (49 sec),"And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. On November 6th, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote for Andy Barr. Great man. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, and more products made right here in the good, old USA."
01:01:28 - 01:02:05 (38 sec),"It's about to respect our laws and to respect the heroes of law enforcement. They are heroes. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division, and to celebrate the greatness and the glory of being an American. It is not up to the media, it's not up to the pundits, it's up to you to decide your own fate."
01:02:05 - 01:02:59 (53 sec),"You have the power with your vote to defend your family, defend your country, defend your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country, returning power to the American people. This great state was settled by really -- I mean, how tough, how smart -- by tough, tough men and even tougher women, by the way."
01:02:59 - 01:03:37 (38 sec),"But it was settled by tough men, pioneer women who braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God."
01:03:37 - 01:04:07 (31 sec),"These courageous Kentucky patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage. For the sake of our freedom, and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win."
01:04:07 - 01:04:59 (51 sec),"We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to glorious victory, because we are American, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
01:04:59 - 01:05:23 (24 sec),"And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Vote for Andy Barr."
00:00:00 - 00:00:56 (56 sec),"So this is supposed to be a Democrat state. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. They have a very big surprise coming, don't you think? Very big surprise. Hello, Minnesota. Great state. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in the heartland with thousands of hard-working and truly great American patriots."
00:00:56 - 00:01:35 (39 sec),"You know that. In less than two years of Republican leadership, America has achieved the biggest comeback in our history. True. Jobs are booming, wages are rising and the number of Americans working right now today has reached an all-time high in our history. We are defending our great Second Amendment... taking care of our wonderful veterans, who we love and respect... and our military will soon be more powerful than ever before by far."
00:01:35 - 00:02:23 (48 sec),"But the radical Democrats want to take it all away. They want to destroy our prosperity. We've had great prosperity. You see what's happening. You don't want your 401(k)s being cut in half, and if you vote Democrat, that's what's going to happen. They want to erase our gains and plunge our country into a nightmare of gridlock, poverty, chaos and, frankly, crime, because that's what comes with it. So we're just five weeks away from one of the most important congressional elections in our lifetime."
00:02:23 - 00:02:58 (36 sec),"You see what's happening in Washington right now so you know how important it is. You see what's going on. By the way, look back there, look at all that media. Look at all that media. If we could ever get them on our side, we'd win for a thousand years -- for a thousand years. On Tuesday, November 6th, I need your vote, I need your support to stop radical Democrats and to elect proud Minnesota Republicans."
00:02:58 - 00:03:57 (59 sec),"And we have some great ones right now up for election. This week I announced another historic victory for our nation. We're replacing the job-killing disaster known as NAFTA... with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. It's called the USMCA. That works, right? USMCA. I didn't want to use NAFTA. That has been a disaster for our country: 50,000 plants and factories moving out, millions and millions of jobs lost, one of the worst trade deals ever."
00:03:57 - 00:04:23 (26 sec),"I actually know one that's worse, but I won't tell you, because we're going to be doing something with that too. But NAFTA's been one of the great disasters of all time and now we have a great and fair deal. We have a fair deal, and that's what we want. Great for our workers and really great for our farmers."
00:04:23 - 00:04:44 (21 sec),"It's about time. We're opening it up. The barriers are coming down. And this is tremendous for Minnesota. This is tremendous for Minnesota. And you've waited for a long time. And by the way, we've got plenty coming. You know what's going on with China? They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. But I say they're not ready yet."
00:04:44 - 00:05:08 (24 sec),"They want to make a deal, but I told them, ""You want to make a deal, but you're not ready yet, so we'll talk later."" We have secured landmark protections for the medical innovations being produced right here in your great state. You have great medical in your state. And we've removed unfair trade barriers for our proud Minnesota farmers and our dairy producers like has never, ever been done before in our country."
00:05:08 - 00:05:31 (23 sec),"America is winning again and America is being respected again all over the world right now, and we're going to keep it that way forever. It's called America first. [Audience Chants USA] You even have people sitting behind the flag. That's... It's OK. Great people. And by the way, you got thousands of people outside and you have thousands of people who I just saw in a lovely room, but I said, ""Next time, you have to get here a couple of days earlier."" Right?"
00:05:31 - 00:05:53 (22 sec),"The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. That's really it. Because you're winning. You're winning a lot. There's never been an administration that in already less than two years -- but can you believe we all did this together? We're coming up on two years, can you believe it? There has never been an administration, with you, that's done so much in so little time."
00:05:53 - 00:06:15 (22 sec),"Two years. No administration's come close. None has come close. And we've got a lot coming. If Democrats take over Congress, the stock market will plummet. They will -- it will plummet. You know, there's a reason for it. Every day we hit new highs, new highs. I think we had 103 new highs. Think of it. All time."
00:06:15 - 00:06:49 (34 sec),"That means jobs. To a lot of people, it means great 401(k)s. It means great -- but to a lot of people, it means jobs. It's jobs. Your 401(k)s will be devastated if Democrats take control and our political system will grind to a really messy halt. And you see what's going on in Congress right now with one of the most respected people, potentially, hopefully Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh."
00:06:49 - 00:07:38 (49 sec),"Man... [Audience Chants We Want Kavanaugh] What they're putting him through, and his family. His family is incredible. What they're putting them through. Democrats want to raise your taxes. They want to restore job-killing regulations. There's no administration ever that's cut as many regulations. And we have regulations."
00:07:38 - 00:08:12 (34 sec),"We want clean water. We want crystal, clear air. We want beautiful environment. We want. But you don't have to have regulation that makes it impossible for our country to compete with other countries, and that's what we're doing. The Democrats want to cripple law enforcement. They want to get rid of ICE. How about ICE? ICE, they're tough and they love our country, but you need tough ones."
00:08:12 - 00:08:35 (23 sec),They're tough. They love our country. They get rid of MS-13. They get rid of these gangs. You wouldn't believe it. They throw them the hell out or they bring them to jail. The Democrats embrace socialism. We're not going to be Venezuela -- you see what's happening -- and open our borders to deadly drugs and violent gangs.
00:08:35 - 00:08:57 (22 sec),"And I've said it and I'll say it as many times as you want to hear it, and it's because of their policy: The Democrats are truly the party of crime, because that's what happens. Open borders, that's what happens. And the Dems are willing to do anything to hurt anyone to get the power they so desperately crave."
00:08:57 - 00:09:13 (16 sec),"All they know is how to do -- you know what the words are -- they want to resist, they want to obstruct, they want to delay, demolish, they want to destroy. That's what happens. That's what happens. And just take a look at what's going on. Democrats have been trying to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh... since the very first second he was announced."
00:09:13 - 00:09:59 (46 sec),"And he was announced for one simple reason: He is an incredible intellect, an incredible person, an incredible talent. He's been an incredible judge. Because they know that Judge Kavanaugh will protect, uphold and defend the Constitution of The United States as written. But all you have to do is look at the polls over the last three or four days and it shows that their rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before."
00:09:59 - 00:10:21 (22 sec),"Nobody's ever seen it. Up 11, up 10, up 14. Nobody's ever seen this before. We love it. Do we love it? We love it. Because people see what's happening and they don't like it. The people of Minnesota and the people of America are going to reject the Democrat politics of anger and destruction, and they are going to vote to keep making America great again, greater than ever before."
00:10:21 - 00:10:47 (26 sec),"And in two years, they are going to vote to keep America great, right? Keep America great. We're almost at that point already, but I can't -- I love ""Make America Great,"" but I can't use it in two years. They'll say, ""What have you been doing?"" right? ""What have you been doing?"" Oh, boy, I tell you, it's been a while."
00:10:47 - 00:11:15 (27 sec),"We have had fun, right? We've had fun. This is -- and they don't even correct me when I say it. They don't even correct me. Fake news media. But this is... I mean, look at this stadium. Look, look. As an example, thousands of people in a room next door, thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in, this big stadium is packed, always."
00:11:15 - 00:11:45 (30 sec),"In all fairness to Minnesota, in Las Vegas, in Missouri. You know in Missouri... [Audience Member calls out] Thank you. I love you too, but you're not my type. No, but -- hey, Missouri. They had 44,000 people outside of a big arena. 44,000 people. Las Vegas. We went to -- West Virginia was incredible. West Virginia."
00:11:45 - 00:12:20 (35 sec),"Tennessee. Tennessee, and you see how far Tennessee went up over the last couple of days. It's incredible. Missouri, wow, have we done great. Josh, Josh. So we're thrilled to be joined by a number of your terrific Republican leaders and I just want to introduce somebody that's been such an incredible help to me in getting your tax cuts, I mean, not so bad."
00:12:20 - 00:13:01 (41 sec),How about this? How about this? The Dems want to raise your taxes. We want to lower your taxes. We don't want crime. Crime's OK for them. They want open borders. How the hell do we not win this thing in a landslide every time? How do you... They're for crime and high taxes. We're for low taxes and no crime.
00:13:01 - 00:13:24 (23 sec),"I don't know. Somehow I don't think I would have been a very good politician on the other side of this equation. But a man who really has been helping me a lot, he's a tremendous force in Washington, he's respected by everybody, Congressman Tom Emmer. Minnesota House Speaker Kurt Daudt. Thanks, Kurt. Your state's next attorney general, Doug Wardlow."
00:13:24 - 00:13:57 (32 sec),"Your next governor -- I hear he's doing very well -- Jeff Johnson. We're also joined by the next United States senator from Minnesota, Karin Housley. Karin. So, Karin is running against a far-left Democrat, Tina Smith, who nobody knows who the hell she is. Who is she? She was appointed. She took a wacky guy's place."
00:13:57 - 00:14:34 (38 sec),"That guy was -- he was wacky. Boy, did he fold up like a wet rag, huh? Man. Man, he was gone so fast. He was gone so fast. I don't want to mention Al Franken's name. OK? So I won't mention it. He was gone -- he was gone so fast. It was like, ""Oh, he did something, oh, oh, oh, I resign. I quit, I quit."" Wow. He was gone and he was replaced by somebody that nobody ever heard of. Her name is Tina Smith."
00:14:34 - 00:14:58 (23 sec),"Honestly, you know, I do this stuff for a living. I'm not sure I have ever heard of her [Inaudible]. The fact is, there's no reason for me to have heard of her, because she's never going to vote for us. She'll always vote for Schumer and Pelosi...and, of course, the legendary low-IQ Maxine Waters. Low-IQ person."
00:14:58 - 00:15:25 (27 sec),"She'll be with Schumer, do whatever he wants. ""What would you like me to do? Should I vote for higher taxes?"" ""Yes."" ""Oh, I want higher taxes. Should I vote against the wall?"" Which is happening, folks. She wants to vote against the wall. She voted against the wall. [Audience Chants Build that Wall] So we are building the wall."
00:15:25 - 00:15:52 (28 sec),"We started it. $1.6 billion. Now we got another $1.6 billion and we just got another. But I want to build it at one time, fast. But we're making a lot of progress on the wall. A lot of progress. I'd like to do it a lot faster. I'm good at building. And Tina voted for deadly sanctuary cities. Karin... Karin, do you promise you will not be voting for sanctuary cities, Karin?"
00:15:52 - 00:16:17 (24 sec),"OK. Good. She wants to keep crime out of Minnesota. That sounds like a good platform, right? Tina Smith would rather protect violent criminal aliens than loyal American citizens, which is why Tina Smith, that nobody ever heard of, needs to be voted out of office. She got appointed, I guess. And Tina Smith is voting against Judge Kavanaugh."
00:16:17 - 00:16:37 (20 sec),"Can you believe that one? So, he was number one at Yale, number one at Yale Law School. I think she's looking for a better student. [Laughter] Finally, I want to introduce two incredible -- by the way, Karin, come up, please, will you?"
00:16:37 - 00:17:12 (36 sec),"You really do go off script, don't you? Jeez. Thank you so much for telling everybody. And he said ""Tina Smith"" way too many times. We need to say ""Karin Housley"" a lot more. Thank you."
00:17:12 - 00:17:50 (38 sec),"Vote for her. Vote for Karin. Now for the people that we're here for. Congress is very important, and I'm here to support Congressman Jason Lewis, who you know. He's a friend of mine, who has worked so hard for us and so hard on your Second Amendment, which is under siege, and so hard on cutting your taxes and regulations."
00:17:50 - 00:18:01 (10 sec),"So, Jason, thank you. Come on up, Jason. And the next representative from Minnesota's 1st District, Jim Hagedorn. Come on up, fellas."
00:18:01 - 00:18:45 (44 sec),"Welcome to Minnesota, Mr. President. Now -- now, everybody in this room knows Minnesota loves President Trump. But I will tell you, in 2020, when he comes back here and takes this state, the whole world's going to know Minnesota loves President Trump. And you know what else Minnesota loves, Mr. President?"
00:18:45 - 00:19:18 (33 sec),"They love tax cuts that let you keep more of your money. Now, in the final analysis, that's really it, isn't it? I mean, growth is great, 4.5 percent growth, more job openings than job-seekers, after-tax income up 6 percent in one year. But in the final analysis, whose money is it? It's yours. You ought to have it. Minnesota loves manufacturing, mining and energy production in the 2nd District."
00:19:18 - 00:19:57 (40 sec),"Minnesota loves our farmers now, thanks to the president, who have free trade and fair trade. Right here in Rochester, Minnesota is very proud and loves health care; the kind of plan that you choose, not the plan that government bureaucrats choose for you. And that's why we repealed the Obamacare mandate and the president signed it into law."
00:19:57 - 00:20:41 (44 sec),"And -- and one more thing, Mr. President. Minnesota loves your judicial appointments. That's right. Minnesota loves your appointments to the lower courts, they love your appointments to the appellate courts, and Minnesota loves your appointments to the Supreme Court, including Judge Brett Kavanaugh. My friends, my friends, that's what's at stake in this election: due process, the presumption of innocence, the rule of law, private property, in other words, the Constitution of the United States."
00:20:41 - 00:21:08 (27 sec),"And if Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House, you can throw that all aside. But you know what? The radical resisters have to come through Minnesota first. And this is where it stops. I'm not going to let it happen, Jim Hagedorn isn't going to let it happen, and President Donald J. Trump is not going to let it happen."
00:21:08 - 00:21:09 (1 sec),Thank you all. On to November and let's win there.
00:21:09 - 00:22:23 (74 sec),"Thank you. Wow. Does Rochester, Minnesota, and southern Minnesota love this president? Absolutely. Boy, think back... Think back where we were just two years ago. Our nation's future was on the line. Had we not won that election, we would have lost the country the way the forefathers put it together. And by the grace of God, and we are grateful and proud, Mr. President, that [Inaudible], and thank you for what you're doing for our country."
00:22:23 - 00:23:16 (53 sec),We are. I just want to give the president a quick update on the Democrat Party here in Minnesota. They've moved far to the left like the rest of the Democrats across the country. We actually have a guy running for governor who wants to make Minnesota a sanctuary state. We have -- we have two people running for the United States Senate on the Democrat Party.
00:23:16 - 00:23:46 (31 sec),"They love late-term abortion and they believe in gun control. And we have all these congressional candidates, including the guy I'm running against, who think that we should have socialized medicine, single-payer. Does that make sense for the Mayo Clinic, Rochester? No, no. They want to resist. They want to replace."
00:23:46 - 00:24:12 (26 sec),"They want to take us back to Obama and then some. Are we going to let that happen? Heck no. No. Not going to let that happen. [Audience Responds No] Mr. President, we're going to work tirelessly. And because of your support and leadership and your endorsement, I want to go out to Washington and serve as a conservative reinforcement to partner with you to keep moving America in the right direction."
00:24:12 - 00:24:14 (1 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President."
00:24:14 - 00:24:44 (30 sec),"Wow. Wow. Good talent. So, Jason and Jim are both running against extreme Democrats. Jim's opponent, Dan Feehan... supports a total government takeover of health care, which drives your costs right through the roof and the health care is lousy, by the way. Oh, is that so? And he wants to make Minnesota into -- true -- a sanctuary for the criminal aliens and for gang members."
00:24:44 - 00:25:16 (32 sec),"That's the people -- they will come flooding up here as soon as you do it. It happens every time. Jason's opponent, Angie Craig... Who the hell is Angie Craig? -- also wants to take away your health care. And she refuses to support Enbridge Pipeline. You know all about that. That would bring more than 8,000 jobs to Minnesota."
00:25:16 - 00:25:43 (28 sec),"And you know we've really opened up Minnesota. You see what's going on with the mines and the miners and the ore. Worst of all, a vote for Dan Feehan and Angie Craig is a vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House. Can you imagine Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House? Don't do that to me. I didn't buy into that."
00:25:43 - 00:26:30 (47 sec),"Neither did you. If Democrats take charge, Maxine Waters will also... Now, listen to this one. She's going to take over Financial Services in Congress. Can you believe it? Maxine Waters. That's one of the most powerful committees in Congress. If you want to stop Pelosi from becoming speaker, if you want to stop Chuck Schumer from becoming majority leader... and if you want to stop the radical Democrats from running Congress, then you need to vote Republican."
00:26:30 - 00:26:58 (28 sec),You have to get out there on November 6th and vote Republican. You've got to get it -- and vote for these people. These are great people. A Democrat-controlled Congress would also pose a grave threat to Medicare. You know what they're doing with Medicare? They'll destroy it. The majority of House Democrats have cosponsored a socialist takeover of health care that would obliterate Medicare.
00:26:58 - 00:27:18 (20 sec),"Their plan is called Medicare for All, except they have no money. But it's really Medicare for none. Their plan would rob American seniors of the benefits they have paid -- and they've paid these benefits and they've paid so much money for their entire lives and you take it away. [Audience Member shouts] Thank you, darling."
00:27:18 - 00:27:59 (41 sec),"Love these people. These people are so great. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors, who have earned it and they've paid for it. And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We're going to take care of them. Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions and some people have -- you know what I say?"
00:27:59 - 00:28:30 (31 sec),"We'll get a little more money from China. It'll be just fine. OK? It'll be just fine. We'll be just fine. We're going to take care of pre-existing conditions, folks. Remember that. The lead sponsor of the Democrats -- think of this. The health care takeover, who is the lead sponsor? I've been reading so much about him."
00:28:30 - 00:28:51 (21 sec),"He did predict I was going to win, by the way. I will say that. That's the only thing he's gotten right in a long time. Keith Ellison. Did you know that? No, he did. That's right. He was on a show the day after I announced. On June 16th, I came down the stair with Melania -- who's right now in Africa, our first lady."
00:28:51 - 00:29:11 (20 sec),"She's doing a great job. Doing a great job for the people of Africa. Amazing. But Ellison was on a show the day after I announced and he looked at two people, the hosts, he said, ""You know he's going to win, don't you?"" And they smiled. One laughed. They spoke. They thought I was just doing this for fun."
00:29:11 - 00:29:41 (30 sec),"You think this is fun? You think this... This is a lot of work. It's a lot more work than anybody knew. And that's the last time he's been right, but I'm glad he was right about that. Ellison is the number two official in the entire Democrat Party and he recently marched in a parade wearing a shirt that read, ""I do not believe in borders."" Oh, that's wonderful."
00:29:41 - 00:30:20 (39 sec),"By the way, you don't have borders, you don't have a country, folks. You don't have a country. Keith Ellison's Democrat Party embraces radical socialism and open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. They want to unleash violent predators and ruthless killers -- and you know it. Somebody would say, ""Oh, gee, why is he saying that?"
00:30:20 - 00:30:46 (25 sec),"That's not"" -- it's true. Like MS-13, near our schools, near our families and into our communities. No good. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans proudly stand with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol and law enforcement, our police."
00:30:46 - 00:31:18 (33 sec),"Great people. They do an incredible job. My administration has also reformed our refugee program to protect American communities like you have in Minnesota, where you're being treated very unfairly, and to protect your families and your taxpayer dollars. If you want security, if you want a border, then what you have to do is immediately go out, think about it, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your workers."
00:31:18 - 00:31:39 (21 sec),"You've got to go November 6th, vote Republican. That'll do it. That'll do it. We need the votes. You know, I keep hearing we have a majority. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority. If somebody's not feeling great, we don't have a majority. It's like -- it's like the saying -- that's why we're getting the wall by hook, by crook, we're getting the wall, but it's so difficult."
00:31:39 - 00:32:07 (28 sec),"These guys want to stop it. They want to say -- you know, it's interesting. We've got $700 billion for the military, which is, you know, many, many, many times -- we've got $716 billion for the military. We are rebuilding our military. But to get money for the wall, their whole life is trying to obstruct the wall because they know we want it. But you know what?"
00:32:07 - 00:32:34 (27 sec),"It's not working. I'd like to do it a lot faster, but it's not working. We're getting the money. You think it's easy? Not easy. But we're getting it built and it's already going up in San Diego and lots of other places along the border. [Audience Chants Build that Wall] This election is about safety and it's about prosperity."
00:32:34 - 00:33:02 (27 sec),"Since the election, we have created over 4 million new jobs. The media will tell you there was no way we could have said that during the campaign. Nobody would have believed it. And we've lifted 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Think of that. You know, when you do that, you save a lot of money and you also make a lot of people really happy."
00:33:02 - 00:33:23 (22 sec),"When you think about it, right? We've added nearly a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, ""You need a magic wand. You'll never do that."" I said, ""What happens? We don't build anything anymore?"" And we have companies pouring into our country and they're coming to Minnesota. They're coming to a lot of states."
00:33:23 - 00:33:51 (28 sec),"But we have companies. They're all coming back. They want to be where the action is. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. The auto companies. I was with Prime Minister Abe two days ago. He said, ""Many of our auto companies are coming back."" I said, ""No, no, that's not good enough. All of them have to come back."
00:33:51 - 00:34:17 (26 sec),"All."" And he's going to do that. They're all coming back. They've already started. You look at Michigan, what's going on in Michigan, where they're coming back so fast -- but they're coming back to Ohio. They're coming back to Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina. And they're coming in to a place called Minnesota."
00:34:17 - 00:34:46 (29 sec),"Do we love Minnesota? 1972. You know what that is, right? That was the last time -- and boy, we came, like, this close. One more speech up here and I would have won this state. I came -- do you remember? I said, ""I think I'm going to win Minnesota,"" and everyone said, ""No, no, it hasn't been won since 1972."" Is that right? 19 -- right?"
00:34:46 - 00:35:20 (34 sec),"The Congress [Inaudible], right? Yeah. 1972. It hasn't been won. I said, ""No, look at the crowds. They love it. We're going to take care of Minnesota. We're going to stop what's happening that's so unfair in Minnesota."" And then on election night, I said, ""Let's go to Minnesota,"" but they already scheduled for a great place, a great state, Michigan."
00:35:20 - 00:35:40 (19 sec),"That's another one hadn't been won in many, many years. I went to Michigan. We had 32,000 people in Michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning. It was already Election Day. So I had to skip Minnesota. I felt so badly because one more speech -- I could have showed up at 3 o'clock in the morning maybe. I don't know."
00:35:40 - 00:36:08 (28 sec),"But we're going to win. We're going to win Minnesota. And you see that just by this crowd. Look at this crowd. This place is... So something I'm very proud of, African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. Think of those two sound bites."
00:36:08 - 00:36:39 (31 sec),"The lowest unemployment, the lowest rate of poverty. So think of this: How does your African-American, how do you vote for somebody else? I've done more for them in two years. African-Americans are coming up and they're saying, ""Mr. President, thank you. Thank you."" And their median income is the highest."
00:36:39 - 00:36:56 (17 sec),"But not only for African-Americans, for Asian, for Hispanic. Hispanic unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. Think of it. Asian unemployment, the lowest it's ever been. People with no high school diploma -- that's a very important group of people to me -- it is by far the lowest it's ever been. Women I'm failing with."
00:36:56 - 00:37:19 (22 sec),"I am failing with women. It's only the lowest in 65 years. Sorry. Sorry. I thought it would be history by now, because I've been saying African-American, I've been saying Hispanic, I've been saying Asian, I've been -- and women, it's only the lowest in 65 years. But I thought by now, it would be OK. [Audience member calls out] Got a lot of energy, this one over here."
00:37:19 - 00:38:03 (45 sec),"She's got a lot of energy. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Sixty-five years, not bad, but soon it's going to be in history, I predict. My administration has taken the toughest-ever action cracking down on China's trading abuses. We have to stop it. And we have a very good relationship with President Xi. I have a very good relationship."
00:38:03 - 00:38:42 (38 sec),"But we can't allow what's happened over so many years to continue happening. They've been taking $500 billion, with a B, out of our country and rebuilding China. And I said, ""We can't do that anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" For years, China has been draining us, taking our factories and building up their country with our money, and at the expense of our workers and our companies."
00:38:42 - 00:39:07 (25 sec),"And we're not going to have it. No more. And not only China. Many countries. Look, many countries. We defend countries that are very rich. They don't pay us or they pay us a small percentage. I mean, look, we get along great with these countries, but take Saudi Arabia. Would you say they have some money?"
00:39:07 - 00:39:48 (42 sec),"So we defend them and they pay a small percentage. I said, ""Excuse me, King Salman"" -- he's my friend -- ""do you mind paying for the military?"" ""Do you mind? Hey."" They're paying for 30 percent. I said, ""Do you mind paying?"" ""But nobody has asked me."" I said, ""But I'm asking you, King."" He says, ""Great."" He said, ""But are you serious?"" I said, ""No, I'm totally serious."
00:39:48 - 00:40:16 (28 sec),"Trust me."" [Laughter] And they'll do it. He said nobody's ever asked him. You're talking about -- by the way, you're talking about billions and billions of dollars. Japan, ""No, President Obama would never have asked. That's not his kind of thing. Not his thing."" Why would somebody ask to be paid back billions of dollars?"
00:40:16 - 00:41:00 (44 sec),"Japan, very rich, very great country. I told you, Prime Minister Abe, great man. Just won a fantastic election. Big results. I have an -- an incredible relationship. I said to him, ""Listen, we're defending you."" We're doing a great job. They were sending missiles over Japan from North Korea. Because of me, those missiles aren't going over Japan anymore."
00:41:00 - 00:41:24 (24 sec),"There are no more missiles, no more testing, no more nuclear. We got our hostages back. We got the remains of our great heroes back, right? The remains. The remains are coming back. That was the most beautiful ceremony. Did anybody see that ceremony a month ago? So beautiful. And the remains are coming back."
00:41:24 - 00:41:56 (31 sec),"And what do I get? I get the fake news saying, ""Why isn't he moving faster?"" I just left -- what? -- three months ago. I had a meeting in Singapore. I mean, this has been going on for 75 years -- now let's say 25 years with the missiles and the nuclear -- but no president's done anything. It's -- it's like, three months."
00:41:56 - 00:42:31 (35 sec),"And they'll say, the all-time great, ""What's taking so long?"" I said, ""It's been three months and you don't have rockets and you don't have missiles and you don't have nuclear testing and we get all of our"" -- I mean, it's crazy. But here's what they say. So, they can't get me. One of them actually said -- a nice guy, a friend of mine."
00:42:31 - 00:43:15 (44 sec),"He actually said, ""Why is the president giving so much to North Korea?"" I said, ""I haven't given anything. What have I given?"" I haven't paid -- I didn't pay $1.8 billion for the hostages like Obama did... with Iran, remember? $1.8 billion in cash. Gave them $150 billion. So I haven't given. But I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim. I have a very good relationship."
00:43:15 - 00:43:44 (29 sec),"So because of that relationship, let's see. I think we'll work something out. Maybe we won't. Who knows? It's a deal. Let's see. But so far -- so I'm -- when did I leave, like three months ago, three and a half months ago, maybe less? And they're saying, ""He agreed to meet,"" because they -- I didn't give -- so you know what I gave them?"
00:43:44 - 00:44:29 (45 sec),"I agreed to meet. That's what they say. I agreed to meet. Is that a big deal? I agreed to meet. I asked the Democrats before -- you know, we were close to a war with North Korea, I'll you what. And my rhetoric was very tough at the beginning. It was really, really tough. In fact, they all said I'm going to cause a war with North Korea."
00:44:29 - 00:44:49 (21 sec),"I'm going to cause a war. And then with Putin of Russia, they said, ""He was too nice."" He was -- that was a great meeting. We had a very successful -- so they want me to get into a boxing match with him. I think I'd do very well. But with Russia... [Audience Chants USA] No, no. It's the fake news. Fake news."
00:44:49 - 00:45:08 (19 sec),"They said with Russia, ""He was too nice. He was too nice."" With North Korea, they said, ""He was too tough. He was too tough."" And let me tell you, if I was really rough with Russia, they'd say, ""He was too tough. He was too tough."" These people are loco, I'm telling you. Loco. [Laughter] People are crazy."
00:45:08 - 00:45:33 (24 sec),"Fake news. The fake news, everybody. They are fake. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation, right? To give our workers and businesses a level playing field, Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. Better vote for Karin."
00:45:33 - 00:45:57 (25 sec),"They want to take them away. They want to take them away. We've taken historic action to make health care more affordable and we've gotten rid of the soaring premiums. You know, the premiums on Obamacare -- nobody realized it. They were going up 116 percent, 138 percent, 200 percent. Through great management and great people, we've kept them down."
00:45:57 - 00:46:25 (27 sec),"We've mostly obliterated Obamacare, although we had it won except for 2 o'clock in the morning -- I say it again -- 2 o'clock in the morning and I was like -- I'm not going to do it. Two o'clock in the morning. But think of it differently: We didn't get one Democrat vote so we're stuck with it, but it's obliterated."
00:46:25 - 00:46:56 (31 sec),"And the big thing is, we got rid of the most unpopular part of Obamacare. It's called the individual mandate, where you have the privilege of paying a fortune so that you don't have to pay a fortune for horrible health care, right? So, the premiums in Minnesota this year are coming down by double digits."
00:46:56 - 00:47:31 (35 sec),"Think of that. And I don't even like this stuff, but while we have the remnants of Obamacare, we're working to make it much more affordable than you had. And to reduce drug prices, the FDA has approved a record number of affordable generic medicines. And that's not all. Drug prices are coming down. You might have seen last month where I called up some of the drug companies."
00:47:31 - 00:48:09 (37 sec),"I said, ""Folks, you just raised up the drug prices. You can't do that."" And they all reduced them. Do you believe it? That's when I said, ""I've a lot of power."" Pfizer, right? You saw that. Pfizer, Novartis, they raised their drug prices and I'm bringing them down. I said, ""What are you doing with raising them?"" ""I'm sorry, Mr. President, we'll reduce them immediately."" I said, ""Man, this is a powerful position."
00:48:09 - 00:48:51 (43 sec),"I never..."" First time in the history of drug companies that they've done that. They literally announced it. I called them the next day. I told them I was extremely unhappy and they said, ""We're going to reduce it."" Who the hell does that? Do you think Hillary Clinton would have done that? [Audience Responds No] I don't think so. I don't think so. [Audience Chants Lock her up] By the way, she or whoever it might have been, crazy Bernie, whoever they put in, they wouldn't have done any of the things -- we did the greatest trade deal."
00:48:51 - 00:49:15 (23 sec),"Look at the money. We did 4.2 percent GDP. They were going down. They would have had a minus four point. They -- they said 4.2 percent is impossible. It's going to go higher, much higher. We have such potential. Between military and trade deals, we have hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fat and potential."
00:49:15 - 00:49:37 (22 sec),"And what I love -- what I love, hopefully you don't need it for a long time or never, to help critically ill patients get life-saving treatments, we passed Right to Try. I love it. I hope you don't need it. I hope I don't need it, too. I hope you don't need it. But that's -- you know, we have the greatest -- frankly, the greatest drug companies in the world."
00:49:37 - 00:50:27 (50 sec),"And we would have drugs that would take four or five years -- you know, we've brought it down from 14 years to get approved down to four. I think we'll be at three or two. But still, you've got to wait a long time. And a person who is dying, a person is terminally ill and they have a great, you know, possible cure, and so a person wants to see if they could possibly -- you couldn't get it. There was no way of getting it. No way in a million years."
00:50:27 - 00:51:09 (42 sec),"I worked with Congress, including these guys and... and Greg. And Greg, right? And Jim and Mark and the whole group. But we worked with Congress and we got it done. I love the name, Right to Try. Now, they can go, they sign a paper. You have no idea: They've been trying to get this for 40 years. You know, who would think?"
00:51:09 - 00:52:12 (63 sec),"They've been trying for 40 years. And it is, you have problems with insurance companies. You have problems with trials. You have problems with so many different things. You have problems with everything. Everything is there -- and you have problems with liability. I said, ""Sign a document that there's no liability."" They don't want to give something, the person dies and then the family sues the country."
00:52:12 - 00:52:39 (27 sec),"That's no good. So you sign away your rights if you take it. And you know what happened? Everybody said, ""Wow, that's a good idea."" Can you believe this? So after 40 years, we have it. And now people are trying it. And you know what? We've had some incredible results. And it's also telling you whether or not this stuff works."
00:52:39 - 00:53:00 (21 sec),"There's something good about that, too. We've had some incredible results, right? I love it. People would fly to other continents, they'd fly to other countries. If they were poor they'd just go away. They'd had no hope. They'd go to their house or their apartment and they'd have no hope. Now, they have hope."
00:53:00 - 00:53:38 (38 sec),"It's beautiful. It's so great. We also passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor... see a private doctor instead of waiting in line. I mean, we had people waiting for three weeks, two weeks, 12 days, nine weeks. We had people that were not very sick. It took them so long to see the private doctor, to see a doctor, a veterans doctor -- and they're good doctors."
00:53:38 - 00:54:07 (30 sec),"We really do, we have great doctors -- but it's a long process. So they're not very sick. By the time they'd see the doctor 22 days later, they'd be terminally ill. Think of it. They would die. They would die on line waiting. They now have the right to go to a private doctor and we pay the bill. Forty-four years they've been trying to get it. I thought that was my idea."
00:54:07 - 00:54:40 (33 sec),"I came back, ""I got the greatest idea."" I said to all my medical people, ""I got the greatest idea. It's taken too long. We could never solve this problem. Too many people, too few doctors. They're great doctors, but you can't get to them. I got the greatest -- we're going to have the people go to a private doctor and we're going to pay for it."" And they said, ""Sir, we've been working on this for 44 years."" But I got it approved because I'm good at getting things approved, right?"
00:54:40 - 00:55:04 (24 sec),"Right? All done. All done. And these people helped me. Right there. They helped me with it. Right there. And we also passed landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable. We say, ""Jim, you're fired. Out. Get out. Get out."" We had no right to do it. Between the unions and the civil servants, they could do anything."
00:55:04 - 00:55:27 (23 sec),"They could be sadists -- and they were. They were sadists. These are sick people. They -- they could be sadists. They could be stealing. They could be robbing you blind. They could be doing anything. You couldn't fire them. They were totally protected. Now, you just fire them. Get them out. We have secured a record $716 billion to rebuild our military and give our brave warriors their largest pay raise in a decade."
00:55:27 - 00:56:03 (36 sec),"And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working -- I'm so excited about this -- to create the sixth branch, number six, of the American armed forces, called the Space Force. We have the Air Force. Now we have the Space Force. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear disaster deal."
00:56:03 - 00:56:34 (31 sec),"And we've opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Presidents have been promising that for many, many decades and I finally know why, because I was hit so hard when they heard I was going to do it. I got calls from every country in the world. ""Please, don't do it."" And I told you the story. I said, ""Look, I don't want to take any calls from any leaders of any countries."
00:56:34 - 00:56:52 (18 sec),"Tell them I'll call them back."" We were going to have it signed on a Monday. Big ceremony. I said, ""Tell them I'll call them back next week."" [Laughter] Because they were calling me and they were saying, ""Mr. President, please don't do that. Please. Please."" So I know why Obama and Bush and everybody didn't do it. I mean, I understand."
00:56:52 - 00:57:27 (35 sec),"There was a lot of pressure put on them. So I just said, ""Tell them I'll call them back next week."" So on Monday I signed it, and then on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday I called everybody back. ""Hi, how are you doing? What's up?"" [Laughter] ""Well, we didn't want you to do..."" I said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. Gee, it's too late."" I said, ""What can I do? What can I do?"" ""What can I do?"" For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America."
00:57:27 - 00:58:28 (61 sec),"Now you have a president who is standing up for America... more than ever before. [Audience Chants USA] We're standing up for your values, we're standing up for Minnesota and we are standing proudly for our national anthem. All right. I'll give you a quick story that they don't know. They've never heard."
00:58:28 - 00:58:47 (19 sec),"It's hard to believe; I thought they knew everything about me. So in making the deal with Mexico and then Canada, -- as you know, Canada was very tough, but that they worked out fine. And the NFL -- because we talk about the flag and the -- I'm not happy about it with the NFL. OK? I'm not happy, if it's OK with you guys -- is it OK with you?"
00:58:47 - 00:59:16 (30 sec),"Not happy. People should stand proudly for our national anthem and for our flag. So I'm not happy. I'm not happy. But that seems to be working out. Do you notice? That's seems to be working out very good. But to show you -- so we're making the deal with Canada. And it's big stuff. You know, it's cars and it's farming and it's agriculture and it's factories and it's big, big dollars."
00:59:16 - 00:59:38 (22 sec),"Tremendous. They say it's the largest trade deal ever made, $1.3 trillion. But I heard that the NFL had a big problem with Canada on their advertising, on the commercials. A big, big problem. I'm not going to get into what it was, but it was a very bad problem and it went on for years and it was really hurting the NFL. Now, I don't care."
00:59:38 - 00:59:53 (15 sec),"I like some of the people. I don't like some of the -- it doesn't matter. It's an American company. It's a great American company. So during the negotiation I said, ""You've got to fix the NFL problem."" They said, ""What?"" I said, ""You've got to fix the NFL problem."" Took me two minutes and now the NFL is so happy it's all worked out."
00:59:53 - 01:00:15 (21 sec),It's all worked out. They don't know that. It's all worked out. We've got to fix it. And now our country will be taking tens of millions of dollars more money. It's going to go -- a lot of it's going to go to the players and they'll still hate me. Can you believe it? But you know what? Think of it. It took me two minutes.
01:00:15 - 01:00:39 (24 sec),"You've got to fix the problem. It's because -- not because I love them or don't like them. I do like them. It's a great American company. I said, ""You've got to fix the NFL problem. It's unfair what you do to them during the Super Bowls. Very unfair."" And I got a call from Roger Goodell. No, very nice. And I figured he was calling about the flag."
01:00:39 - 01:01:05 (27 sec),"Like, to say, ""Could you leave us alone, please?"" [Laughter] And he wasn't. He said, ""Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for what you did. You solved a problem that was going on for years."" The Obama administration couldn't do it. Nobody could do it. Nobody could get it done. I did it in two minutes. It was like, ""You've got to do it. We've got to do it."" It was a tiny, little part of the deal."
01:01:05 - 01:01:26 (20 sec),"I figured, ""What the hell? It was like two sentences."" But it was very nice. Roger Goodell called me and then Bob Kraft, who owns -- who's a great owner. Now, it's great to have Coach Belichick and Tom Brady, that's a good thing, right? I always say, ""Bob, you're a great owner and you're one of the luckiest men on Earth."
01:01:26 - 01:01:41 (16 sec),"You took Tom Brady in the sixth round, right? And you have the greatest coach in football."" That's a good thing and he's a great guy. But he called me to thank me and Roger Goodell called to thank me. Very nice. And we're all friends. I want what's good for the country. People said to me... True. One of my killers called up. We have very tough negotiators, very smart guys."
01:01:41 - 01:01:55 (14 sec),"We have, like, the A Team of the world. And he said, ""You know, we could have that -- that NFL thing. I heard about it for years."" Everybody heard about it, what they were doing. I said -- I said -- they said, ""You know, I think we could fix that NFL deal for you."" I said, ""Let's fix it."" They said, ""Really?"
01:01:55 - 01:02:16 (21 sec),"You want to do that?"" I said, ""No. They're a great American company. They're going to pay tax on that money. They're going to pay the money to people that work and live in our country. Fix the deal."" They were surprised. I said, ""Fix it."" They fixed it and it was a nice thing. OK, enough of that. That's enough of that."
01:02:16 - 01:02:32 (16 sec),"True. So the NFL, good company, great, great people. We're lifting millions of our citizens -- and you know this -- from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And a lot of people are coming out of prisons and they're able to get jobs now."
01:02:32 - 01:02:53 (21 sec),"Isn't that great? They're getting a second chance and even a third chance and they're getting jobs. And people that are hiring many of these prisoners are saying unbelievable how good they are. It's so beautiful to see. And before, they wouldn't have a chance. People didn't want to hire them. They're hiring people coming out of prison and these people are stepping up. I have a friend that hired many, quite a few, and he said, ""I can't say every one,"" but he said, ""These people are unbelievable."
01:02:53 - 01:03:18 (25 sec),"They're so hard-working. We've given them a second chance."" It's a -- to me, it's a beautiful thing. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends and get your family and get your neighbors and your coworkers and get out, and you have to -- November 6th, you have to go out and vote Republican."
01:03:18 - 01:03:56 (39 sec),"Send Jason Lewis and Jim Hagedorn to the House. And vote to send Karin Housley... Get Karin Housley into the Senate. We need her. We need her vote. We need her. She's going to be fantastic. Forget about Tina. Karin, they're going to get you in. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation and more products made right here in the good old USA. That's what we want."
01:03:56 - 01:04:29 (33 sec),"It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and to love and respect the heroes of law enforcement. Great. They're great. They're great people. No easy job. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division and destruction -- it's destruction -- and to unite together as citizens, as patriots and as Americans."
01:04:29 - 01:05:06 (37 sec),"To everyone in this beautiful, big, rich room, to every citizen watching across our land, this is your time to choose. It's a time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past, or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. It's not up to the media or to the pundits to decide your fate."
01:05:06 - 01:05:38 (32 sec),"It's up to you. This was the greatest movement, 2016, all of those hats, Make America Great Again. Look at them. Amazing. Amazing. It's the greatest movement in the history of our country. It is. I mean, there's never been a movement like this. There's never been a movement like this. As an example, the presidential election is not for two and a half years."
01:05:38 - 01:06:05 (27 sec),"Look at this room. Look at this. Look outside. This is not a normal situation. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country and they know it. And they don't even challenge me when I say it, because if I was wrong, there would be headlines. ""Donald Trump..."" [Laughter] It's up to the proud people of our country and the very proud people of Minnesota, a great state."
01:06:05 - 01:06:49 (44 sec),"You have the power with your votes to defend America's honor and reclaim America's future. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. Together, we are taking back our country, returning power to the American people. This state was settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women... who braved the wilderness to build a life and to build a home."
01:06:49 - 01:07:27 (38 sec),"They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country and they loved their god. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to tear down their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage."
01:07:27 - 01:07:59 (32 sec),"For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory."
01:07:59 - 01:09:19 (80 sec),"Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together we will make America wealthy again... make America strong again... we will make America safe again... and we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:01:05 (65 sec),"Hello, Mississippi, hello. Beautiful. [Audience Chants USA] Well, I have to start by saying that 2020 is looking really easy, isn't it? I think the fake news media back there is starting to get it, folks. I think they're starting. They're starting to understand what's going on. And I'm thrilled to be back in this great state, with thousands of proud, loyal, hard-working American patriots."
00:01:05 - 00:01:41 (36 sec),"Thank you. In less than two years, we've achieved the biggest comeback in American history. That's what's happened. The economy is booming. Wages are rising. And more Americans are working today than ever before. Today -- ever before. Think of it. Now, just think of that. Today, we have more Americans working than we've ever had in the history of our country, right now, today."
00:01:41 - 00:02:20 (39 sec),"How great is that, right? We're defending our Second Amendment, protecting religious liberty, taking care of our great veterans... and rebuilding America's military like it hasn't been rebuilt ever before. This week, we made history again when I announced that we are replacing the job-killed disaster known as NAFTA with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement."
00:02:20 - 00:03:16 (56 sec),"A good one. And it's a good one. We're calling it USMCA. You're going to like that name. That'll become a part of your vocabulary. USMCA. Companies aren't going to be leaving us anymore and firing everybody and sending their product back into the United States with no tax. That was what I wanted. You know, Mississippi, when they leave and they go next door and they fire everybody and they build the product and send it back and sell it to the same people that were buying it before -- no, we don't want to do that anymore."
00:03:16 - 00:03:47 (31 sec),"No we don't want to do that anymore. It's not a good -- that's not a good thing to do. Although there is a group called globalists. They think it's just fine. Not fine. They're globalists. [Inaudible] globalists. We don't like the thinking of the globalists. The USMCA is an incredible victory for our farmers, our ranchers, our factory workers, and our entire nation."
00:03:47 - 00:04:20 (33 sec),"America is winning again, and America is being respected again, maybe respected like never before, because we are finally putting America first. But exactly five weeks from today, all of this extraordinary progress is at stake. It is at stake. I'm not on the ballot, but in a certain way, I'm on the ballot, so please go out and vote."
00:04:20 - 00:04:57 (37 sec),"Go out and vote. On November 6th, you will head to the polls -- hopefully -- in one of the most important congressional elections of our lifetime. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. A Democrat takeover of Congress will plunge our country into gridlock and chaos like you haven't seen before."
00:04:57 - 00:05:25 (28 sec),"It'll come to a halt. And I have to tell you, all of those people, with your savings accounts and your money piled up in your bank, it's all -- a lot of it's going to disappear, and it'll disappear really fast. Your 401(k)s -- I stand up all the time with great Americans. ""Sir, I'd like to thank you. My wife thinks I'm one of the greatest investors in the world."
00:05:25 - 00:06:05 (40 sec),"And two years ago, she thought I was a total loser, sir. Now she loves me so much."" ""Because my 401(k)..."" ""... has gone up 55 percent, sir, since you got elected! 55 percent!"" Ah, it's amazing. You can really get your wife to like you a lot when that happens. You've got to be really bad. I'll tell you. And that's happening."
00:06:05 - 00:06:33 (28 sec),"And it goes the other way, too. That happens. People are geniuses now. And we've helped. You know, we had probably -- and even the fake news would tell you -- the greatest victory in the history of this country in 2016. There's never been anything like that. The people came from the hills and the valleys."
00:06:33 - 00:07:05 (32 sec),"They came from all over. And they voted, voted, voted. And they love Trump, and they loved us. Because it wasn't me, it was all of us. It was all of us. And that's what's happening. That's what's happening. But it's all fragile. The Democrats will open our borders to deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The Democrats -- and I say this -- and I've dealt with it -- the Democrats are the party of crime."
00:07:05 - 00:07:41 (36 sec),"And that's what it is, they're the party of crime. Radical Democrats want to tear down our laws, tear down our institutions in pursuit of power, demolish our prosperity in the name of socialism and probably worse... and abolish our borders in the service of globalism. There is nothing Democrats aren't willing to do, and you're seeing it day by day, and you've seen it more the last week than you've ever seen it before."
00:07:41 - 00:08:07 (26 sec),"And no one -- just think of this. No one under any circumstances is allowed to speak up if you're on this side of the equation. But guess what? We're speaking up like nobody has ever spoken up before. They want to get the power that they so desperately crave that was taken away from them. All of the Democrats know and all they really know how to do is obstruct, resist, demolish, destroy and delay."
00:08:07 - 00:08:25 (17 sec),"They've been trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced... because they know Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written. [Audience Chants We Want Kavanaugh] You know, for 10 years, I don't know him, I never met him, but I'd been hearing there's this guy named Brett Kavanaugh who is... who is like a perfect person, who is destined for the Supreme Court."
00:08:25 - 00:09:03 (39 sec),"I've heard that for a long time. And -- a lot of smart people. And first in his class at Yale. Top, top in his class at Yale Law School. He'd led, like, a life that's unbelievable. He's had no problems. They've never taken him out of restaurants. They've never -- this is like a person that everybody thought at the highest level on both sides, they said, ""Someday he will be a Supreme Court judge."" Right?"
00:09:03 - 00:09:40 (36 sec),"He will be a justice of the Supreme Court. And all my life, I've heard that the most important thing that a president has to do as president is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice and... And I disagree. I think war. I think our military. I think peace. I think those things are -- you know, those things are pretty important, right?"
00:09:40 - 00:10:02 (22 sec),"That's pretty important. They don't say that, but I say those things are pretty important. But I'll have to tell you, the appointment of a Supreme Court justice -- and I look at him, and I looked at the man that we appointed just before him, Justice Neil Gorsuch... who was put through the paces, but nothing like what's happening now."
00:10:02 - 00:10:31 (29 sec),"It's just crazed. It's crazy. What's happening now, they had gang rape. A gang rape. Many times. Well, that turned out to be false. So many different charges. Guilty until proven innocent. That's very dangerous for our country. That's very dangerous for our country. And I have it myself all the time. But for me, it's like a part of the job description."
00:10:31 - 00:11:18 (47 sec),"[Laughter] Let it happen to me. Shouldn't happen to him. Shouldn't happen to him. What he's going through: 36 years ago, this happened. ""I had one beer."" Right? ""I had one beer."" ""Well, you think it was..."" ""Nope, it was one beer."" ""Oh, good. How did you get home?"" ""I don't remember."" ""How did you get there?"" ""I don't remember."" ""Where is the place?"" ""I don't remember."" ""How many years ago was it?"" ""I don't know."
00:11:18 - 00:11:44 (26 sec),"I don't know. I don't know."" ""I don't know."" ""What neighborhood was it in?"" ""I don't know."" ""Where's the house?"" ""I don't know."" ""Upstairs, downstairs, where was it?"" ""I don't know. But I had one beer, that's the only thing I remember."" And a man's life is in tatters. A man's life is shattered. His wife is shattered."
00:11:44 - 00:12:15 (31 sec),"His daughters, who are beautiful, incredible young kids -- they destroy people. They want to destroy people. These are really evil people. And then you see... And then you see the people that are doing it. I know every one. I could tell you things about every one of them. Da Nang Richard Blumenthal. This guy lied about his service."
00:12:15 - 00:12:36 (20 sec),"He didn't just say, ""Gee, I was in the service."" No. He said, ""I was in the Marines. Da Nang Province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill."" This went on for 15 years when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. I thought he was a great war hero. And then it turned out he was never in Vietnam."
00:12:36 - 00:13:13 (38 sec),"He was in the Reserves! And I watched him two days ago. I watched him saying, ""We need the truth. If we don't have"" -- and here's a guy who was saying people were dying all around him and he was never there. And then he cried. When they caught him, he cried like a baby. [Laughter] Like a baby. When Jimmy Swaggart cried, it was nothing compared to Da Nang Richard."
00:13:13 - 00:13:47 (34 sec),"Nothing. Jimmy Swaggart was nothing compared to -- he cried, ""Oh, oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so"" -- he only lied for 15 years. And now we get something. And now he talks about lying. And this man's not lying. So Blumenthal is a fraud. He's a fraud. And the reason he got elected is because in Connecticut it's impossible for a Republican to get elected."
00:13:47 - 00:14:22 (35 sec),"And I did well there. But you can't. He actually gave up the race. You'd thought he lost. You remember that? He, sort of, gave -- he stopped campaigning. It was over. And then he won by three points. And we have him in the Senate. And now he's this great honorable guy, because you know why? The fake news doesn't ever want to put that stuff on. They don't want to talk about it. They don't ever want to put it on. They're a bunch of fakers."
00:14:22 - 00:14:53 (31 sec),"And then you have Cory Booker, right? Cory Booker. Here's a guy who destroyed practically by himself the city of Newark, New Jersey. He was such a bad mayor. And see what he wrote himself about women. Check it out, folks. Check it out. Then he talks -- ""How dare you treat a woman like that."" Take a look at what this guy wrote."
00:14:53 - 00:15:35 (42 sec),"And I know about every one of them. I could go on and on. How about Feinstein? How about her? ""We need more time for the FBI. The FBI has to do a more thorough search. We had another woman just reported by a sleazebag lawyer named Avenatti."" Sleazebag. Sleazebag. We have -- well, it turned out even NBC, who's as bad as they get -- even NBC couldn't shield her with that interview."
00:15:35 - 00:16:11 (36 sec),"Did you see that interview? This woman had no clue what was going on. No clue. And yet she made the most horrible charges against a number one in his class at Yale, perfect human being, great father, great husband. This is a great person. And people are saying, ""Well, maybe it's true. And because of the fact that maybe it's true he should not become a United States Supreme Court justice."" How horrible is this?"
00:16:11 - 00:16:41 (30 sec),"How horrible is this? So this is an important time for our country. This is a time when your father, when your husband, when your brother, when your son could do great. ""Mom, I did great in school. I've worked so hard. Mom, I'm so pleased to tell you, I just got a fantastic job with IBM. I just got a fantastic job with General Motors."
00:16:41 - 00:17:13 (32 sec),"I just got -- I'm so proud."" ""Mom, a terrible thing just happened. A person who I've never met said that I did things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job, Mom. I don't know what to do. Mom, what do I do? What do I do, Mom? What do I do, Mom?"" It's a damn sad situation, OK? But we better start as a country getting smart and getting tough and not letting that stuff right back there, all those cameras, tell us how to live our lives."
00:17:13 - 00:17:50 (36 sec),"Because they are really dishonest people. Not all of them, but damn well most of them. That I can tell you. Fake news. So that's something to think about, right? That's something -- think of your son. Think of your husband. Think -- I've had many false accusations. I've had it all the -- I've had so many -- and when I say it didn't happen, nobody believes me. But it's me. It's my job description."
00:17:50 - 00:18:26 (36 sec),"Mr. Trump, it's OK, you can say whatever you want. They can say whatever they want about me. It's fine, because we have the worst libel laws anywhere in the world. They can say anything they want, and we can't sue them, because if you're famous, you can't sue. Figure that one out. But to take people that are just outstanding and have had great lives, and that life doesn't mean a thing."
00:18:26 - 00:18:50 (24 sec),"And do you notice with the judge, they don't talk about his last 35 years? They don't talk about what -- everybody knows him. He's a very well-known and most highly respected person until the last couple of weeks, because they're destroying him and they're destroying his reputation. And we can't let that happen."
00:18:50 - 00:19:08 (18 sec),"We can't. Can't let it happen. And I don't even know him, folks. I don't even know him. I met him for the first time a few weeks ago. I don't even know him. So it's not like, ""Oh, gee, I want to protect my friend."" I want to do what's right for this country. This is a very important time in our country... OK? Very important thing."
00:19:08 - 00:19:54 (46 sec),"Very important time in our country. The Democrat Party has become too extreme -- this is an example of it -- and too dangerous to be trusted with power. That is why you must vote Republican on Election Day, and you have to go out and vote. You know, I'm listening to commentators, and they say, ""If Trump were running, he's going to beat everybody."" They're saying that."
00:19:54 - 00:20:24 (31 sec),"You know, it's hard for them to admit that. And I certainly dream about all these people. Biden, the guy never had more than 1 percent in a poll when he was running for president, and then Obama took him off the trash heap, right? Biden -- I hear Biden wants to take me to the back of a barn. He would be in big trouble, I will tell you."
00:20:24 - 00:21:02 (38 sec),"Remember he said that? ""I'd like to take him."" You know, with Biden, you go like this -- whew -- and he goes down. [Laughter] Biden. And the other ones. But they say that, ""Donald Trump isn't running, so will the people go out and vote in three weeks?"" You got to go out and vote. And they say, ""But Donald Trump doesn't like Congress."" I really do. I like a lot of the people in Congress."
00:21:02 - 00:21:27 (25 sec),"Some I'm disappointed in, but for the most part -- and I have to tell you something: We have the right ideas. We're making our country great again. We're doing the right thing. We need more Republican votes. They say we have a majority. We barely have -- if somebody has a cold and stays home, we don't have a majority."
00:21:27 - 00:21:49 (22 sec),"That's how bad it is. Republicans have to go out and vote. And they say if I was on the ticket, everybody would go, it would be a landslide. Even the fakers back there, they say that. And I'm not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket. Because this is also a referendum about me and the disgusting gridlock that they'll put this country through."
00:21:49 - 00:22:20 (31 sec),"Think of it. We have the greatest economy in history. We have a military that will soon be the strongest we've ever had. Our country is doing so well. And then we have a Maxine Waters saying, ""We have to get rid of him. We have to get rid of him!"" Maxine Waters. And Nancy Pelosi. She's another beauty. Get out and vote!"
00:22:20 - 00:22:49 (29 sec),"I want you to vote. Pretend I'm on the ballot. And don't worry, we'll be on the ballot in two years, and we will do a landslide like you haven't -- like you wouldn't believe. A couple of the reporters I see back there, they said, ""Oh, Trump is running."" And I must say, one of them said, right after I announced, June 16th -- right after I announced, there was a Sunday morning show."
00:22:49 - 00:23:14 (24 sec),"And one of them said, ""You know he's going to win, don't you?"" And another one, who's back there now, who's looking very well, said, along with the host, ""Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, you're only kidding. He's just doing this for fun."" You think this is fun? Yeah, actually, it's sort of fun. I guess it is. For me, it's fun."
00:23:14 - 00:23:47 (33 sec),"For me, it's fun. You know why it's fun? Because we're achieving our goals better than anyone thought possible. That's why it's fun. If I wasn't, it wouldn't be fun. But this one particular reporter, she said, ""Ho, ho, ho, you're only kidding, right? Ha, ha, that's so funny."" And I'll never forget on election night, ""Donald Trump is your next president, folks."" And it's driving them crazy."
00:23:47 - 00:24:13 (27 sec),"So, we're thrilled to be here tonight, and I am having a lot of fun. But it is true: I'm having fun because nobody ever would have believed in a million years that we would have accomplished what we've accomplished. Nobody has accomplished more in two years. You take a look at the first two years of any -- nobody has even come close to accomplishing what we've accomplished."
00:24:13 - 00:24:29 (16 sec),"And I'm doing it for you, and we're doing it together, because this is a whole thing that has never happened in our country before. You know, it's interesting, when we first started, there were a lot of people who were showing up. And by the way, you think this is a big crowd in here? This place is packed, right?"
00:24:29 - 00:25:13 (44 sec),"Right? And if there was one empty seat, they would say, as the Washington Post did say -- the Washington Post came -- you saw that, right? -- came to an arena someplace four hours early and they hadn't started letting the people in yet. And he put a picture of an empty arena. There were tens of thousands of people outside waiting to come in. The Washington Post put a picture of an empty arena, and they put a caption to the effect, ""Mr. President, not a very good crowd, is it?"" And you know what happened?"
00:25:13 - 00:25:40 (27 sec),"And they had a picture up of an empty arena like I was a -- I didn't even land for four and a half hours later. And when I landed, that place was just like this. It was packed with thousands of people outside. Now, did they fire that reporter? No. Did they fire that reporter? No. Right? They -- isn't it incredible?"
00:25:40 - 00:26:17 (37 sec),"Isn't it sad? And look what happened to Roseanne. Did they fire Roseanne? Yes. No, but think of it. Puts a picture of an empty -- like it had 5 percent. People were just starting to trickle in. And said, ""Not a very good crowd, Mr. President."" There was no games. You know what happened that night? People that were sitting on stairwells, people that couldn't get a seat, people that were here only cause the fire marshals were so incredible, that shouldn't have even been allowed to come in, with thousands outside, they said, ""This is a fraud by the Washington Post."" I was there."
00:26:17 - 00:26:37 (19 sec),"There were no empty seats. We set a record that evening for crowd attendance. Because we don't need much of a stage. Basketball, they need a big -- you're filled up with people, like it is tonight. And we barely got an apology. And he admitted he was wrong. You know where he did it? On his little Twitter account."
00:26:37 - 00:27:03 (27 sec),"[Laughter] And that kind of dishonesty happens all the time. Happened at the inauguration. It happened at the inauguration. It happens all the time. These are very, very dishonest people. We are thrilled to be joined tonight by several great Republican leaders. And we're going to start with a friend of mine who is a very special man, very special."
00:27:03 - 00:27:36 (33 sec),"He's a great governor. Done a fantastic job. He called me. He built the African-American Museum. Called me. We went there. It was so beautiful. We had -- I was at the opening. We cut the ribbon! Governor Phil Bryant. Governor. Thank you, Phil. Thank you, Phil. Should we bring Phil up here? He's been so -- come on. Get up here, Phil."
00:27:36 - 00:28:02 (26 sec),"Come, come, come. Come on, Phil, get up here. What a great governor he's been. Look at this guy. Is he central casting or what? Is he -- look at this. He's central casting. But you know where he's really good? His heart and his brain. Great brain and great heart. Seriously."
00:28:02 - 00:28:53 (51 sec),"Thank you! Are we proud to have Donald J. Trump here in Mississippi? All right, I don't want to get started, but I can tell you what. This man has done more as president of the United States in two years than any president that I can ever remember or ever studied about. He is a remarkable man that is making America great again! [Audience Chants USA]"
00:28:53 - 00:29:19 (26 sec),"Thank you very much, Phil. Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves. Tate? Tate? Where is Tate? Thanks, Tate. Doing a good job. And Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann. Delbert? Thank you. Thank you. And I want to thank your members of Congress that are here, because they've been warriors, they've been friends."
00:29:19 - 00:29:38 (19 sec),"They helped me with the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country... the biggest tax reform, the great regulation cuts, which could be even more important, frankly, than the tax cuts, if you want to know the truth, because it means jobs. But you have some great -- Congressman Trent Kelly. Trent, thank you."
00:29:38 - 00:30:14 (36 sec),"Gregg Harper. Thank you very much. And David Kustoff. Thank you, David. There's another warrior in the room. These are warriors. Look, the abuse they take, the abuse we all take, if you're not a warrior, you just go home, go to the corner, put your thumb in your mouth and say, ""Mommy, take me home."" You got to be a warrior."
00:30:14 - 00:30:54 (40 sec),"And a guy who is a wonderful friend of mine and has always been there for me, Senator Roger Wicker. Roger? What a great -- and Mrs. Wicker, thank you. What a great guy. And he's doing great. Get out and vote for him, anyway. He's winning by a lot, but get out there and vote. We love Roger. Finally, I want to introduce the person we are all here tonight to support, a true Mississippi patriot, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. Come on up. Cindy, come up."
00:30:54 - 00:31:41 (47 sec),"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. And I told him he would get a warm Mississippi welcome, and you did not disappoint. Yes! We are the Hospitality State, Mr. President. And I tell you, it is such an honor to work with this man. Is he not the best president we have ever had? This is wonderful."
00:31:41 - 00:32:13 (32 sec),"You know, early on, I was a supporter of then-candidate Donald J. Trump, and I was on his ag advisory committee. And now every time I walk onto the Senate floor, I want to help President Donald J. Trump. It is such an honor to work with a man that, I'll tell you, he loves the veterans, he loves the military, and he loves our law enforcement, as well."
00:32:13 - 00:32:40 (27 sec),"You know, this past week -- this past week in Brookhaven, Mississippi, my hometown, we had two officers shot down this past weekend. And I was able to tell him about that, James White and Zack Moak. And then the next day, we had a Mississippi Highway Patrol trooper, Josh Smith, shot down. And I'm just going to ask you to remember those people in your prayers as we continue on with this."
00:32:40 - 00:33:11 (31 sec),"We've had a tragic week in Mississippi with our law enforcement, but this man supports law enforcement 100 percent. I just want to thank our great governor, Phil Bryant, for making me your U.S. senator, to appoint me to that, an opportunity of three lifetimes. Other than being the mother of Anna Michael Smith and the husband of Mike Smith, it is the greatest honor of my life."
00:33:11 - 00:33:28 (17 sec),"And what a treat to serve with Senator Roger Wicker. When I tell you he's been a friend, he has been a friend to me on the Senate floor, no doubt. I tell you, you know, when I was sworn in as your U.S. senator, Vice President Mike Pence, he put this pin right here on me, and he said, ""Cindy, this pin will get you in any door in Washington, D.C."" But I want you to know, this isn't my pin."
00:33:28 - 00:33:40 (13 sec),"This is your pin. This is Mississippi's pin. We've got a lot of work to do in Washington, D.C. This man is leading the charge. We're going to get back on Air Force One, and we're going back to Washington, because you know what? We've got a Supreme Court justice to get confirmed! We got to. So I'm going to ask for your prayers, also, for the Kavanaugh family."
00:33:40 - 00:33:43 (3 sec),"And I'll tell you tonight, my true prayer is God will continue to bless these great state  of the United States!"
00:33:43 - 00:33:53 (9 sec),"Thank you, Cindy. [Audience Chants USA] Thank you, Cindy. Great. You know we had a great friend who was senator, and did a fantastic job, and it was just his time. He called me, it was his time. And you know who I'm talking about, wonderful man. And he said, ""You're going to have to appoint somebody."" And I went to Phil."
00:33:53 - 00:34:38 (45 sec),"I said, ""Phil, who's the best?"" And Phil had no doubt in his mind. That's who he recommended. And since then, Cindy has voted with me 100 percent of the time. She's always had my back. She's always had your back. And a vote for Cindy is a vote for me and make America great again. And a vote for Cindy's opponent, Mike Espy, is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary low-IQ person Maxine Waters."
00:34:38 - 00:35:19 (41 sec),"That's why Schumer's PAC is funding Mike Espy with a lot of money. A vote for Espy is a vote for the Democrat agenda to open borders and for radical socialism. When Espy was in Congress, he even sponsored legislation alongside Nancy Pelosi to provide taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens. Oh, that's great."
00:35:19 - 00:35:47 (28 sec),That's just what Mississippi wants. I don't think that works in Mississippi. Does that work? I don't think so. I don't think so. Your vote in this election will decide which party controls the United States Senate. It's very important. Very important. And that's a great woman. That's a great woman. Gotten to know her very well over the last number of months.
00:35:47 - 00:36:10 (24 sec),"If Democrats get control, they will raise your taxes, flood your streets with criminal aliens, weaken our military, outlaw private health insurance, and replace freedom with socialism. In a short period of time -- of course, I'll be doing lots of vetoes, just so don't worry too much -- they will turn America into Venezuela."
00:36:10 - 00:36:35 (25 sec),"How's that working out? And our country will never be Venezuela. We won't let that happen. If Democrats get 51 seats, the key Senate committees will be run by the far left Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. It's amazing that he wasn't more angry that the election got stolen from him, right? I don't get it. You know, he's always like complaining, complaining."
00:36:35 - 00:36:51 (15 sec),"He's jumping around. The hair's going crazy. The hair's going crazy. He's jumping like a lunatic. But he never complained about the fact that crooked Hillary cheated him out of the election. It's amazing. It's amazing. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up] You know, Bernie was on television recently. And he was screaming and ranting and raving."
00:36:51 - 00:37:14 (23 sec),"And I said to my wife, Melania, who's now in Africa representing us, first lady... I watched her get off that plane this morning in Africa. And so beautiful. And she was hugging and kissing children. It was beautiful to see. She's doing a great job as first lady, I will tell you. Really great. And you think that's an easy job?"
00:37:14 - 00:37:40 (26 sec),"That's not an easy job. That's a tough job. She's fantastic. But Bernie Sanders was ranting and raving and ""We're going to this"" and ""Trump and Trump and we got to stop"" -- what he's going to stop? Having a strong military? Having low taxes? Having borders? What's he going to stop? What am I doing? What's he going to stop?"
00:37:40 - 00:38:07 (27 sec),"Having less regulation? But he's going to stop Trump. He's going to stop Trump. He's going to stop us left and right. He's ranting and raving. And the commentator looks at him and goes, ""You know he's winning, don't you?"" And Bernie just looked at him like this. It was like -- but I said to my -- you got to hand it to him."
00:38:07 - 00:38:56 (49 sec),"You know, he's out there. He's doing his thing, whether you like it or not. He's out there doing his thing, and you've got to hand it to him. But a guy like Bernie would be in charge of the Budget Committee. Patrick Leahy -- oh, he's never had a drink in his life. [Laughter] Check it out. Look under ""Patrick Leahy/drink."" [Laughter] ""How dare you have a beer while you're in high school?"
00:38:56 - 00:39:27 (32 sec),"How dare."" ""Patrick Leahy-drink"" will be in charge of the Appropriations Committee. Bob Menendez -- you don't know about him -- will be in -- I'll leave him alone, because we can't cover too many of these characters, right? But I'm going to leave him alone -- will be in charge of Foreign Affairs. And the great Dianne Feinstein... will be in charge of the Judiciary Committee."
00:39:27 - 00:39:46 (19 sec),"No. Wasn't that great? Wasn't that great? Wasn't that something the other day? She was asked a simple question, ""Did you leak the document?"" -- wasn't that great? -- by John Cornyn. He goes, ""You leaked the document."" ""No. What? No."" ""Uh, remember?"" ""No. Oh, no, I didn't. No, I don't think I -- well, wait."
00:39:46 - 00:40:08 (22 sec),"Did we leak the document? No."" [Laughter] ""How about the aide?"" ""No, you idiot! No!"" [Laughter] ""No, we didn't leak the document. We didn't leak the document. No, we didn't."" That was the worst body language that I've ever seen. Oh, what a group. What a group. Holier than thou, aren't they? Holier than thou."
00:40:08 - 00:40:41 (33 sec),"You know the expression, right? What a group. Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats in Washington want to raid Medicare to pay for their socialist agenda. They're going to destroy it. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and paid for it, right? Right? And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing location."
00:40:41 - 00:41:37 (56 sec),"We're going to have to do that. Pre-existing conditions. We have to take care of pre-existing conditions, because it's just the way life is, folks. We have to do that. And the Democrats are talking about it and they can't do it, because they have no plan. So just put it down. And some Republicans say, ""Is that a Republican thing?"" Whether it is or not -- and to me it is, and it always will be -- pre-existing conditions will always be taken care of by us. Have to do it. We have to do it. We have to do it, and we want to do it. I want to do it. We're all going to do it. We're doing well."
00:41:37 - 00:42:11 (33 sec),"We'll take it from China. We'll take it from the European Union, who has taken advantage of us for years. We'll take it from Japan. We'll take it from our new, beautiful transaction, which is a fair transaction, and good for them, too, Mexico, Canada. We're going to have plenty of money coming in, folks, when we fix up these horrible trade deals."
00:42:11 - 00:42:37 (26 sec),"So we're going to take care of pre-existing conditions. People that have a problem are going to be helped by the Republican Party from -- from the time I got elected, really. You look at what we've done with Obamacare. It's a disaster. We had it beaten. But I'll say it a different way than I have been saying it. We didn't get one Democrat vote."
00:42:37 - 00:43:04 (27 sec),"We had it repealed and replaced. A little shocked took place early in the morning. But the fact is, we didn't get one Democrat vote. We would have saved a trillion dollars -- think of it -- our country would have saved $1 trillion had we gotten that extra vote. We didn't get one vote from one Democrat. But we've pretty much dismantled it. And here's a nice story."
00:43:04 - 00:43:37 (33 sec),"We've managed it well. And your premiums have gone up very little by -- remember, they were going up 156, 201, 187, 116 percent? Now we have it down. But we're getting rid of it entirely. We're going to have great health care. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE -- the brave, brave people of ICE."
00:43:37 - 00:44:14 (37 sec),"In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. That's what they want to do. Democrats also support strongly sanctuary cities of death. Sanctuary cities. Every day, sanctuary cities are unleashing vicious predators and bloodthirsty killers, like MS-13, into our communities. They go out and they hide out in sanctuary cities."
00:44:14 - 00:44:38 (24 sec),"Then they come into our cities and our towns. And then we send ICE in, and ICE has no problem. You know why? Because ICE is much tougher and much smarter than them. And ICE has done an incredible job. And they grab them by the neck and they throw them the hell out of our country or they throw them into jail."
00:44:38 - 00:45:04 (26 sec),"And you don't want that job. And you don't want that job. And you don't even want -- although maybe you could handle that job, right? But they do a fantastic job. And we have to cherish our law enforcement. And that goes for Border Patrol, that goes for ICE. We're setting records on the border on arrests."
00:45:04 - 00:45:30 (27 sec),"We don't want to do that. We're building the wall. It's going up. But getting money is brutal -- brutal. [Audience Chants Build the Wall] So we've started the wall. And we've done a lot in California and elsewhere -- San Diego. We're moving eastward, and we're covering a lot of territory. They gave us $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and another $1.6 billion."
00:45:30 - 00:46:17 (46 sec),"I want the whole thing, because we can do the whole damn wall, and we can do a great one in one year. But getting money from the Democrats is tough, because they know that's a big issue for us. And they know we need it. Most of them voted for it in 2006. I don't know if you know that. Most of them. But, of course, you have to have a wall."
00:46:17 - 00:47:15 (59 sec),"You have people pouring across. They're tackling people. And then, of course, they have catch and release. You catch somebody. ""Who is this person?"" ""It's a criminal."" ""Oh, that's OK. Catch, take his name and release the person."" And the person they think will come back to court. We have the dumbest immigration laws in the whole world."
00:47:15 - 00:47:45 (30 sec),"Watch what happens over the next couple of weeks, folks. Watch. Watch. And it's all because of the Democrats. Every Republican wants some change. But they stop you. The only thing they're good at -- they're lousy politicians. They're horrible in policy. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They're only good at one thing: resisting."
00:47:45 - 00:48:37 (51 sec),"They're good at sticking together. You rarely see them break up. They stick like glue. They stick. That's the only thing they're good at: delay and resist. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. If you want security, if you want a strong border, if you want to have a country that is a great, great, safe country, then you need to go out and you need to vote Republican."
00:48:37 - 00:49:08 (32 sec),"Have to do it. And everybody. This election in November is about safety and it's also about prosperity. They're going to take your wealth away from you. They're going to take your wealth away. All of that we've done with the jobs and the salaries and the wages that are rising for the first time in 21 years, they're going to take it away from you so fast."
00:49:08 - 00:49:44 (35 sec),"Since the election, we have created over 4 million new jobs. Unheard of. Unheard of! Unheard of! And lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. That's a big thing. We've added nearly 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. You remember when the previous administration said, ""Oh, you can't do manufacturing""? I said, ""Really, who's going to build things?"" They said, ""You won't add any."" They said you needed a magic wand, remember?"
00:49:44 - 00:50:10 (26 sec),"A magic wand. We don't have a magic wand. We've got good policy. We've got good leadership. We have a lot of good leaders in our party. And you've heard this many times over the last three weeks: African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded -- ever! Ever! Remember ""What do you have to lose?"" What do you have to lose, right?"
00:50:10 - 00:50:34 (24 sec),"What do you have to lose? I said. And people said, ""Oh, that's not nice."" But I said, ""Wait, they have the worst crime rate. They have the worst schools. They have the worst homeownership percentages. They have the"" -- I went through a list of 10 different things. And I looked up, and they've always voted for Democrats, the African-Americans, 95, more, percent."
00:50:34 - 00:51:10 (36 sec),"And I looked up and I said, ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" Remember? And now... Not only do they have the lowest unemployment rate in history, but African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate also ever recorded. It's a great thing, right? So -- and we've just started. We've just started. Remember, same true for Hispanic Americans, the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded."
00:51:10 - 00:51:54 (43 sec),"Same for Asian Americans, lowest unemployment rate ever recorded. Women, lowest unemployment rate in 65 years. After years and years of working so hard, we finally put ourselves in a position where we can do things. And we can really do them. But we could do them an awfully lot better if we had more -- a real majority, not a majority of one, not a majority of literally if somebody's sick, it's like we have to postpone votes."
00:51:54 - 00:52:14 (20 sec),"We need a real majority, and we're going to do everything that you've been looking for for a long time. You know, with that being said, we've done so much. We've done so much. We've just finalized the tremendous new trade agreement with South Korea, where it was a disaster. That was a Hillary Clinton catastrophe."
00:52:14 - 00:52:39 (25 sec),"Remember she said, ""We are going to create 250,000 new jobs""? And she was right, for South Korea. It was good. [Laughter] And we've just totally renegotiated it. We've made it good. And we've opened up new negotiations with Japan, who would not negotiate with the previous administration. You know why? Because they said, ""No, we're happy."
00:52:39 - 00:53:07 (28 sec),"Why should we negotiate? We're not going to negotiate."" Well, we said, ""We want to negotiate."" And with the European Union, ""We want to negotiate."" And they said... [Audience member calls out 'We Love You'] I love you, too. You're not my type, but I love you. That was a strong guy, by the way, in case... [Laughter] Because if that was a woman, I'm in big trouble."
00:53:07 - 00:53:40 (33 sec),"And you know what? I go, I hope you're a guy. Are you? So -- so the European Union and Japan, I said, ""Listen, we lost $151 billion, with a B, with you."" We lost $151 billion. Jean-Claude -- he's the head of the European Union -- I said, ""Jean-Claude"" -- he's tough and smart, smart, really tough. I don't think he likes our country too much, but I've told him that many times."
00:53:40 - 00:54:00 (20 sec),"Well, they were formed -- right? -- they were formed in order to take advantage of us. ""So, Jean-Claude, for years, the Obama administration wanted to negotiate and you said, 'No, we're not going to negotiate.' I'm telling you, I want to negotiate."" We lost $151 billion with the European Union. Many of us come from the European Union."
00:54:00 - 00:54:20 (20 sec),"I do. I do. Many of the people in the room, sounds so nice, European Union. And they're just killing us. So I said, ""We have to negotiate."" ""Oh, yes, yes."" Two weeks go by, we don't get a call. I call him up again, I say, ""Jean-Claude! We got to negotiate."" ""Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes."" Beautiful accent."
00:54:20 - 00:54:48 (28 sec),"I wish I had his accent. [Laughter] I would have been president 15 years ago if I had his accent. And I said, ""Jean-Claude, please, we got to negotiate! I can't take this, $151 billion we lose. You have barriers against our farmers. We can't sell farm products. You have barriers against our cars, and yet you give us millions of Mercedes and BMW and all these cars, they pour into our country."
00:54:48 - 00:55:11 (22 sec),"You have barriers and you charge us big tariffs for products. And you make it impossible for us to give you -- but you sell us so much. Jean-Claude, we have to negotiate."" And he said, ""Oh, yes, yes, yes."" Two weeks go by. No negotiation. I say, ""Jean-Claude, you don't have to negotiate anymore, Jean-Claude."
00:55:11 - 00:55:38 (27 sec),"I am going to put a 25 percent tariff on Mercedes Benz, BMW, and every car you send in to the United States."" ""We're putting a 25 percent tariff or tax on every car, millions and millions of cars, that you send in to the United States."" He said, ""No, no, no, please! I will be there tomorrow morning."" This was an evening."
00:55:38 - 00:56:02 (24 sec),"I get to my office. He's there. [Laughter] I said, ""Where did you come from, New York?"" ""No, no, no, I came from Europe."" I said, ""Let me know the name of that plane. That is the fastest plane."" [Laughter] And now they're dying to make a deal. You saw what's been going on with these deals. China! They're draining us. They're taking our money."
00:56:02 - 00:56:37 (35 sec),"They're rebuilding themselves. They're building a jet a day. They're building many, many bridges the size and bigger than, like, the George Washington Bridge. What are we doing? We're helping them. We've rebuilt China. They've taken so much money. I like President Xi, the head of China, but I said, ""We can't do this anymore."" So now we put $50 billion of tariffs on. And they said... They said, ""No, no, no, no, you cannot do that."
00:56:37 - 00:57:00 (23 sec),"If you go $50 billion, we'll go $50 billion."" I said, ""Wait a minute, we're already $500 billion behind. So if I go $50 billion, you go $50 billion, that means we're at the same place we started from. That's not what this is all about. We have to bring some balance. We can't do this."" So they said, ""No."" So it's $50 billion at 10 percent."
00:57:00 - 00:57:30 (30 sec),"I increased it to 25 percent, and I put $200 billion on top of the $50 billion. So now we have $250 billion at 25 percent. By the way, billions and billions of dollars. The fake news people back there, all those people with all those red lights... they don't want to talk about it. But all of that money, billions of dollars will be flowing in to our treasury."
00:57:30 - 00:58:00 (30 sec),"Many of the products that we're buying over there will be made in the United States because they don't want to pay the tax and there's no tariffs. And I said, ""If you attack our farmers, who I love"" -- they're special. See, he's got the green hat on? ""Make Our Farmers Great Again."" Right? ""Make Our Farmers Great Again."" But they said, ""You know what?"
00:58:00 - 00:58:26 (26 sec),"The farmers love Trump. We'll attack the farmers by not buying"" -- well, guess what? They're starting to buy again, aren't they? But I said, ""If you do that, we're going to put an additional $267 billion onto your numbers. So we're going to have $500 billion and probably it'll end up $562 billion when you add it all up, including the little stars all over the place."" And you know what?"
00:58:26 - 00:58:48 (22 sec),"They want to talk. They want to make a deal. Then China's been hurt very badly over the last number of months. Their markets are down 30 percent. And our markets are up 55 percent since I became president. And I hope we can make a deal with China, but honestly, who knows? But we're very happy where we are."
00:58:48 - 00:59:08 (19 sec),"Very, very happy. And I want to thank the farmers, because, you know, I watch the farmers. And they say -- and don't forget, the farmers have been going down like this for 20 years; long before I got here. We're going to bring those green caps. You're going to be so proud of me, OK? You're going to be so proud."
00:59:08 - 00:59:30 (23 sec),"They want to talk. And at some point, they're talking. But I told them just recently, ""You're not ready to talk yet. You're not ready."" In all fairness, they've been making so much money. It's hard for them to say -- they're making $500 billion a year because we had -- ha, let's be nice -- we had presidents that it wasn't their thing."
00:59:30 - 00:59:51 (21 sec),"But it is my thing. Do you know how wealthy our country would be if they didn't have these really stupid deals all over the place, so many of them? And how about our military deals, where we protect rich nations and we don't get reimbursed? How about that stuff? That's changing, too, folks. We protect Saudi Arabia."
00:59:51 - 01:00:20 (29 sec),"Would you say they're rich? And I love the king, King Salman. But I said, ""King, we're protecting you. You might not be there for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military."" ""You have to pay."" And Japan is going to also contribute. Japan -- we protect Japan. They pay us a small percentage. We protect South Korea."
01:00:20 - 01:00:44 (24 sec),"They pay us -- and by the way, we're doing great on North Korea, but South Korea. They got to reimburse us. They've got to reimburse us. Republicans passed and I signed the biggest package of tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. We have cut a record number of regulations. Now, we got no Democrat support for any of this."
01:00:44 - 01:01:24 (39 sec),"This is what's driving our economy, those two things. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs. Watch what's going to happen to drug prices. And to help critically ill patients get access to life-saving treatments, we passed what's called Right to Try. A person's terminally ill, they're going to die, and before me, if we had a drug that was really looking good or promising, we wouldn't give them, because we didn't want to hurt the person."
01:01:24 - 01:01:46 (22 sec),"They're going to die. And it is actually much more complicated than that. They've been trying to pass this for 45 years. Well, two months ago, I signed Right to Try. We have the greatest drugs in the world, the greatest drugmakers in the world. I would watch wealthy people travel all over the world trying to find a cure."
01:01:46 - 01:02:09 (24 sec),"And poor people just went home. They had no hope. Now they have the right to try. If we have a drug that looks good but it's two years or three years or four years out -- and, by the way, we brought that number from 15 years, we think it's going to be down to four and in some cases three. Way down. Scott is doing a great job."
01:02:09 - 01:02:33 (24 sec),"Scott, get that number down, Scott. And now we have that -- I love that. Right to Try, such a great name. Right to Try. You have hope. We also passed veterans' choice. Forty-four years they tried to do it. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor if they've got to wait on line for weeks and weeks and weeks."
01:02:33 - 01:03:05 (32 sec),"Forty-four years! And we passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act. That's people that work in the V.A. that treat our veterans badly, and we couldn't do a thing about it, and now we can fire them so fast... I just signed legislation -- and you think that was easy, getting that through the unions and civil service?"
01:03:05 - 01:03:47 (42 sec),"That was a 48-year job. And your two senators helped me a lot, I will tell you. They helped me a lot. Thank you, Cindy. Thank you, Roger. And your congressmen, by the way, helped me a lot -- in particular your congressman. I just signed legislation to completely rebuild our military, securing $700 billion, and then the following year $716 billion to purchase the finest planes and ships and tanks and missiles and submarines on the face of the Earth, all made in America, made in the USA."
01:03:47 - 01:04:16 (29 sec),"And we have given our troops their largest pay raise in more than a decade. Isn't that nice? About time. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working very hard to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces. It's called the Space Force. So you have the Air Force, you have the Space Force. Separate."
01:04:16 - 01:04:47 (30 sec),"The Space Force. And that's what it's all about, folks. You look at what's happening. I'm not just talking rockets to the moon and to Mars. I'm talking about defense. I'm talking about -- that's where it is. It's in space. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, right? Space Force! I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal."
01:04:47 - 01:05:06 (20 sec),"And Iran is a much different country. They're trying to put out all the riots they have all over that country. You know, when I became a president, I looked there -- before I became -- I said, ""How are you stopping Iran?"" Nobody was able to tell me. And I did this and they have shattered, man. They have shattered."
01:05:06 - 01:05:36 (30 sec),"I got rid of that deal. How about we gave them $150 billion for nothing? We gave them $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. And we've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we won't even mention how well we're doing with North Korea. But when I came in there, too, they were going to go to war with North Korea."
01:05:36 - 01:05:58 (22 sec),"President Obama said it was his biggest problem. We sat before I took office. ""What's your biggest problem?"" ""Biggest problem is North Korea. We were going to go with North Korea."" We're doing very well now with North Korea. You don't feel that way anymore, right? You don't feel that way anymore. And the fake news comes out and says, ""He's giving so much."" I haven't given anything."
01:05:58 - 01:06:28 (30 sec),"We got our hostages back, right? We've got a lot and we're getting the remains of our great fallen heroes back. There's been no rockets launched. There's been no missiles launched. There's been no nuclear tests. And we have a good relationship. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going over to North Korea next week."
01:06:28 - 01:06:48 (20 sec),"And we're working on a second summit. And it just feels good. Now, who knows, folks? Who knows? I can just tell you, when we came in, before I came in, and at the beginning when the rhetoric was tough, right, that rhetoric was tough, these people were saying, ""Oh, he's going to get us into a war."" Well, guess what?"
01:06:48 - 01:07:18 (30 sec),"That worked out. That rhetoric was tough. And let's see what happens. But we're doing very well. We're doing very well. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Mississippi."
01:07:18 - 01:08:15 (57 sec),"We are standing proudly. We are standing up for your national anthem. Right? [Audience Chants USA] A lot of spirit. A lot of spirit. One of them said the other day, ""You know, President Trump can't be beaten in 2020."" That's driving them crazy. Oh! Who the hell's going to beat us? Look, who's going to beat us? If another president came in, and they said, ""We're coming to Mississippi, and we're going to make a speech,"" you know how many people would show up? Really, 300, 400. You'd have a medium-sized meeting room at a hotel."
01:08:15 - 01:09:03 (47 sec),"Look at this place. Look at this place. Look at this place! We're lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get out and vote Republican, vote for Cindy Hyde-Smith and vote for Roger Wicker."
01:09:03 - 01:09:40 (37 sec),"Got to do it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation and more products made right here in the USA. It's a vote to reduce crime, respect law enforcement and restore the rule of law. It's a vote for strong borders, safe communities and thriving families, which you are. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, destruction, chaos, and to come together as neighbors, as citizens and as Americans."
01:09:40 - 01:10:07 (27 sec),"To everyone in this room tonight, to every citizen watching all across our land, this is your time to choose. Very important time when you look at what's happening to Judge Kavanaugh. This is a very important time. It's time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past or whether we continue forward into the unlimited promise of our future."
01:10:07 - 01:10:41 (34 sec),"It's not up to the media or the pundits to decide your fate. It's up to you. The future is in your hands, as it was in 2016. That was a beautiful time. There has never been an election like this in our country's history. You have the power -- just as you did in 2016 -- with your vote to same America from socialism and to save America from decay."
01:10:41 - 01:11:16 (35 sec),"It's up to you on November 6th to choose a future of patriotism, prosperity and pride. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to everyday Americans. We stand on the shoulder of the giants of American history, the greatest, the toughest, the most courageous men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth."
01:11:16 - 01:12:09 (53 sec),"Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, won a revolution, and fought to victory in two world wars. Think of it. Think of it. Right? Think of it. American patriots defeated fascism, triumphed over communism, and delivered millions and millions and millions of people into freedom. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to tear down their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage, right?"
01:12:09 - 01:12:37 (28 sec),"Just like the pioneers and patriots who came before us, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory."
01:12:37 - 01:13:35 (58 sec),"Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Mississippi. Get out and vote. Thank you."
00:00:00 - 00:02:00 (120 sec),"Hello, Kansas, thank you very much. Hello, Kansas. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be here with all of my friends on this truly historic night. This is a historic night. I stand before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our nation, our people, and our beloved constitution. Just a few hours ago the U.S. Senate confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court, and I proudly signed the judge's commission aboard Air Force One just before landing."
00:02:00 - 00:02:33 (33 sec),"And this Monday night, at 7:00 pm in the East Room of the White House, We will perform the swearing in ceremony for soon-to-be Justice Kavanaugh, a great man. And he will sit proudly alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch, who's doing a great job to uphold your sacred rights and to defend your God-given freedom."
00:02:33 - 00:03:15 (42 sec),"And I want to thank our incredible Republican senators for refusing to back down in the face of the Democrats, shameless campaign of political and personal destruction. Since the moment Brett Kavanaugh was senate, and you remember this, we made an announcement and since right from the moment we announced, radical Democrats launched a disgraceful campaign to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy, right from the beginning."
00:03:15 - 00:03:39 (24 sec),"Brett Kavanaugh is a man of great character and intellect. He's a totally brilliant scholar, who has devoted his life to the law, he is a loving husband, a devoted father, and a faithful public servant, and he always has been. What he and his wonderful family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable, unthinkable."
00:03:39 - 00:04:11 (32 sec),"In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob, you saw that today with the screaming and the shouting, not from the 200 people or less that were --  You know what? Those people, they couldn't fit in the front row, look what we have here today. They threw away and threw aside every notion of fairness, of justice, of decency and of due process."
00:04:11 - 00:04:45 (34 sec),"Nobody's seen anything like it. What each of you will have a chance in just four weeks to render your verdict on the Democrats conduct at the ballot box. Got to vote, got to vote.  On November 6th, you will have the chance to stop the radical Democrats, and that's what they've become, by electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate. We will increase our majorities. We need more Republicans, we need more Republicans."
00:04:45 - 00:05:30 (45 sec),"Over the past few weeks, every American has now seen the profound stakes in the upcoming election. You now see it. We have been energized, we have been energized. if Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, Just imagine the devastation they would cause if they ever obtained the power they so desperately want, and Greg. You'll going to have other Supreme Court justices places to be filled it could be three, it could even be four, it could be a lot."
00:05:30 - 00:06:06 (36 sec),"And if you allow the wrong people to get into office, things could change, they could change, and they could change fast. And we're not going to let that happen, we can't let that happen. It could go very quickly, it can change very fast, we can't let that happen. You don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry leftwing mob, and that's what they've become. The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern."
00:06:06 - 00:06:33 (27 sec),"Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob. We're doing a hell of a job of doing it, we're draining the swamp and we want to defeat the Democrats conducively. So under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, America is winning because we are finally putting America first, we are putting America first."
00:06:33 - 00:07:08 (35 sec),"Yesterday it was announced that unemployment has fallen to 3.7%, the lowest  unemployment rate in 50 years, lowest in 50 years. We've created nearly 600,000 jobs in the last three months alone, think of that, 600,000, and if I ever said that, when I was campaigning, the fake news media would go, I'd say, ""Impossible."" They are fake."
00:07:08 - 00:08:17 (69 sec),"Manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high. Confidence, very important, all-time high. And we have the best economy in the history of our country, the best.We're taking care of our veterans, protecting our great seniors, and rebuilding America's military might like it hasn't been built before. But if Democrats take control, they will try to plunge our country into gridlock poverty and chaos, and that's what's going to happen, it can change."
00:08:17 - 00:08:53 (35 sec),"The Democrats want to significantly raise your taxes. Essentially, they want to impose socialism, Venezuela, dismantle law enforcement and eliminate our borders. They want to have nice, open borders, no way. Bill. The Democrats have become the party of crime, they have become the party of crime, think of it. Republicans are the party of law and order, and justice."
00:08:53 - 00:09:18 (25 sec),"And we really have become, even more so, than ever before the party of opportunity and wealth, and that's what's happening with creating wealth for everybody. Whether it's small businesses big businesses or people wanting great jobs, that's what's happening. And you know wages? Right now, for the first time in 19 years, wages are going up for people, and jobs. you can choose the job you want for the first time. Many years."
00:09:18 - 00:09:45 (28 sec),"So we are thrilled to be joined by a number of your state's terrific Republican leaders. And  I have to tell you that I wasn't supposed to be here because, you know, this is such a big day. This is such a big day. I was supposed to call you, they said, ""Do you mind calling Kris Kobach and Steve Watkins? Do you mind telling them?"
00:09:45 - 00:10:19 (34 sec),"That because of the fact that we are, today, getting this great, great, talented, wonderful Supreme Court judge. They said, ""Could you call the people of Kansas and tell them we won't be able to make it tonight.?"" I said, ""I don't have the courage to do that. I don't have the courage"" I said, ""I don't have the courage."" They call me, they said, ""Sir, we're signing the next United States Supreme Court justice."""
00:10:19 - 00:10:51 (32 sec),"They always say, you've heard it. The biggest thing a president can do, they've always said, is Supreme Court justice the biggest, and some of it none. We've had two in less than two years, I guess, you know, some of [Inaudible] some presidents have it. But it's the biggest thing you can do so they said, ""Sir, do you mind canceling Kansas tonight? We're going to have -- "" I said, ""No way I'm canceling Kansas. No way. No way."""
00:10:51 - 00:11:16 (25 sec),"I had that phone working, I had that phone working on that plane, I had that signature going on the plane, and here we are. And by the way, you think this crowd inside is big, you could see the crowd that's outside. We just put up big movie screens but I think this is better, right? This is better. I want to thank Congressman Roger Marshall, has been a great friend."
00:11:16 - 00:11:34 (18 sec),"Roger has been a great friend, and a great friend also, Ron Estes, great person. He helped us so much with the tax cuts, with regulation cuts, with so many things that we've passed that nobody thought would be possible, would be possible. So thank you both very much. Where are they? Where are they? Thank you very much, fellas, thank you. Fantastic"
00:11:34 - 00:12:18 (44 sec),"And also, I want to thank somebody who's done a fantastic job, GOP Chair Kelly Arnold. Kelly? Great job. You know why a great job? Because we won this state by a lot, right?  And after what I just did for you with the new deal with Mexico and Canada, I think we should double it up, I think we should double it up. USMCA, USMCA. I refused to call it NAFTA because NAFTA was such a horrible deal."
00:12:18 - 00:12:57 (39 sec),"You didn't even realize it, that was so --  50,000 plants and factories emptied out, millions and millions of jobs lost, so we negotiated a new deal, and I said,  ""There's no way of calling it NAFTA 2, USMCA. And we opened up -- we opened up agriculture, we opened up dairy, we opened up a lot of things and everybody's really happy."
00:12:57 - 00:13:32 (35 sec),"I don't know how they're doing in the other places but they're really happy. So congratulations. Congratulations. And we also signed a great new deal with South Korea and the farmers are going to be benefiting there too. And we're working -- Right now they  want to make a deal. I said,  ""You're not ready to make a deal yet."" We're working on a deal with China."
00:13:32 - 00:14:03 (31 sec),"We'll see. Well see. Well see. Look, they've been hitting us hard for a long time. We've never had a president that did anything about it. $500 billion a year, that's a big one. They take out. So right now we're doing extremely well with China, and let's see what happens. Maybe we'll do it and if we don't we're going to be in even better position, you understand that. So we'll see."
00:14:03 - 00:14:42 (40 sec),"I also want to thank a man of incredible integrity and class, your governor, Jeff Collier. Jeff? Jeff? Where's Jeff? Jeff is a great guy who's doing a really incredible job and thank you, Jeff. But I didn't know Jeff. I told Jeff, I said, ""Nothing personal, I just didn't know you because when I backed Chris and you have one hell of a governor."" And I think we have to talk about bringing him down to Washington or something. We talked about it."
00:14:42 - 00:15:06 (24 sec),"Great governor, great man. We're also joined by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt. Thank you. And president of the Kansas State Senate Susan Wagle. Susan. Thank you, Susan. I'm so proud that our Campaign Manager Brad Parscale, you know Brad, Brad Parscale. Where's Brad? Guy's like 7 feet tall, so you can't miss him. Thank you, Brad."
00:15:06 - 00:15:38 (32 sec),"Our chief, our chief you know him, our Chief Operating Officer Mike Glassner. You know Michael? He's fantastic right from the beginning. Thank you, Michael. They all come from Kansas. They all come from Kansas. I guess that's how we win, you get from Kansas you wouldn't lose them. Along with our amazing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He is doing a great job."
00:15:38 - 00:16:06 (28 sec),"He's headed over to North Korea. This guy travels, boy you got to do that to be a good one. You know, if you're home a lot you're not doing much of a good job. We're doing a great job with North Korea we're doing a great job with everybody. Mike Pompeo from Kansas. Great man. And also here with us tonight is your next lieutenant governor, Wink Hartman. Thank you, Wink. Thank you, Wink."
00:16:06 - 00:16:30 (25 sec),"So a man that's been with me from the beginning, he's tough, he's strong and I hated that he ran because I would have loved to have brought him into my administration, effectively loses, I'll bring him into my administration in two seconds. I hope he loses because I want him so badly. But don't do that."
00:16:30 - 00:17:45 (74 sec),"Don't you. Don't do that. I was angry when he did it. I said, ""Don't do it."" ""Sir, I want to be the governor of Kansas. I love my people."" I said, ""Don't do it. Don't do it."" I was very unhappy. I was very, very unhappy. I said, ""Don't do it."" Then he went out and he's been winning and he's been doing an incredible job. But he does, he loves this state. He loves the state so much and I want to introduce the next governor of Kansas, Kris Kobach."
00:17:45 - 00:18:33 (48 sec),"Well let me just say on behalf of all of Kansas, President Trump, welcome to Trump country. It is such an honor and a blessing to have President Trump here in the city where I grew up to support my campaign in the state that we all love. And I want to give President Trump credit for something really important, it's something he and I have worked together on. We've worked for a number of things but the most important is stopping illegal immigration.  I'm so glad that America has a president who gets it and knows that illegal means illegal."
00:18:33 - 00:18:57 (24 sec),"I want to tell you a quick short story about illegal immigration. I began working on this issue when I was an adviser to John Ashcroft at the time of 9/11. I was there during 9/11, and we all remember how the world changed. But let me tell you something that you may not know. All 19 hijackers came into this country legally on temporary visas."
00:18:57 - 00:19:25 (28 sec),"Five of them became illegal mostly by overstaying their visas. Four of those five were stopped by state and local law enforcement for speeding violations. They were illegally in the country at the time but the cops didn't know it, and so they could -- they didn't make an arrest even though they could have if they'd had that information at their fingertips."
00:19:25 - 00:20:24 (59 sec),Now get this. Three of those for pi -- the three of those for illegal aliens that they could have arrested were pilots. So if they had made those arrests they could have stopped 9/11 from happening. Those numbers have shaped my career. The gravity of that has never left me and I will not and I know President Trump will not allow our immigration system to be used again as a weapon to harm the American people.
00:20:24 - 00:20:42 (18 sec),"Stopping illegal aliens is not just about jobs, it's not just about crime. i's about our nation's security, and that comes first. And illegal immigration is an issue in this campaign for governor. Did you know that my opponent Laura Kelly voted to continue allowing sanctuary cities in Kansas? She did. She did. Look it up. It's in the roll call vote."
00:20:42 - 00:21:33 (51 sec),"When I am governor, God willing, sanctuary cities will end in this state. Laura Kelly also voted to allow illegal aliens to continue getting welfare benefits. So while we're struggling to pay our electricity bill to pay higher taxes, we're meanwhile giving taxpayer dollars to illegal aliens. Is that fair? It's time to stop illegal aliens from getting taxpayer dollars."
00:21:33 - 00:21:53 (20 sec),"It's time to put Kansans first, not illegal aliens. There's another big issue. [Crowd cheering] There's another big issue that President Trump and I have both been concerned about. Voter fraud. Because of the law that I drafted in the Kansas legislature passed, Kansas now has the most secure election laws in America. Photo ID creates trust in our elections."
00:21:53 - 00:22:23 (30 sec),"If you need a photo ID to cash a check or to buy the kind of Sudafed that works, you probably going to need one to go cast a vote in an election. And proof of citizenship too, proof of citizenship. Every time an alien votes, every time an alien votes, it cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen. The Democrats and their socialist friends, they claim they care about voter cancellation or voter suppression, but they don't care about us citizens votes being canceled out."
00:22:23 - 00:22:59 (36 sec),"It's time for other states to require proof of citizenship too, just like Kansas. One more, one more topic. Taxes. Thanks to President Trump, our federal tax burden is much lower. But in Kansas, our state taxes are the highest in the region. It's time to cut our state taxes here in Kansas. When I am governor, the first bill that I want to sign is one that passes along the Trump tax windfall to the people of Kansas."
00:22:59 - 00:23:25 (26 sec),"$137 million. And on top of that, you've got thousands of Kansans being taxed out of their own home because of property tax appraisal increases, they can't afford to live in the home they wanted to retire in. When I am governor we will put a 2$ cap on property tax appraisal increases."
00:23:25 - 00:24:45 (79 sec),"To put it simply, I want to do for Kansas what President Trump has done for America. [Crowd cheering] We've got a big election, a big election ahead of us on November 6th. It's a point of choice, not only for America but a big decision for Kansas. Tonight, President Trump is here calling on us to get out there and vote, calling on us to stand up, the time is now. To stand up for the proven principles and constitutional rights that have made this country great and made this country strong."
00:24:45 - 00:25:08 (23 sec),"And the time is now, that we must reject the political correctness that the progressives and the left are constantly putting on us. And stand up, and stand up for the time-tested values of hard work, faith in God and the United States Constitution. Thank you, President Trump, for making America great again. And now we're going to make Kansas great again."
00:25:08 - 00:25:35 (27 sec),"Thank you. What a job he did for me, I'll tell you, what a job he did. He's going to be a great governor. He will do the job for you. He is going to be a great, great governor. He is a tireless champion for border security. He'll fight for you every single day. He doesn't stop. He'll protect your family, he'll protect your children."
00:25:35 - 00:26:20 (45 sec),"Now his far-left opponent is Laura Kelly. Voted to raise your taxes. And she supports giving public benefits to the illegal aliens [Inaudible. And Laura Kelly earned an F. And never even heard of an F. An F-rating from the NRA. An F. I assume that means that she's not too big on the second amendment, is that way? How would that be? Everybody get out and vote for my friend Kris Kobach on Election Day, please."
00:26:20 - 00:26:34 (14 sec),"Finally, I want to introduce another terrific Republican candidate, your next congressman. Get out and vote. I need him in Washington. Steve Watkins. Steve is a great veteran. He's a patriot, and a proud West Point graduate, that means he's very smart. Steve, come on up."
00:26:34 - 00:27:18 (44 sec),"Hey. Kansans can do anything. I'm proof of that. I. Grew up a couple of miles away. And here I am standing next to the leader of the free world. And not just any leader, a truly great one. You see, when I left -- when I left Kansas I went among other things I spent eight years in war zones, eight years with my boots in the sand of Iraq and Afghanistan."
00:27:18 - 00:27:50 (32 sec),"Eight years. And in all that time -- all that time I really just learned a couple of things, I know for sure that I have seen the devil, but I have also seen fighters, Donald Trump is a fighter. He fights. He fights for America first, he fights to keep our borders secure, he fights for jobs he fights to those [Inaudible] approaching retirement."
00:27:50 - 00:28:53 (63 sec),"He is a fighter and we are so honored to have him here in Kansas. He moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Yes. He likes -- he likes appointing pro-constitution judges to the bench. And he is tough on China, Iran, and North Korea. Do other things, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Now Kansas, Kansas, you know, might be a little partial, but just think how much more he could have accomplished if he were a Kansan."
00:28:53 - 00:29:07 (14 sec),"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for all that you do, for Kansas, and for America ,and for this world. We're so glad you're here. Thank you, sir."
00:29:07 - 00:29:30 (23 sec),"Good man. Good man. And a vote for Steve is a vote for me and our agenda to make America great again. You know that agenda. A lot of hats. A vote for Steve's opponent, his name is Paul Davis. He's not good, he's not good, you know that, is a vote for a radical agenda of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the legendary Maxine Waters."
00:29:30 - 00:30:18 (48 sec),"Here in Kansas, his opponent Paul Davis voted time after time to raise your taxes and fees. And he voted to give public benefits to illegal aliens at work. If you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker of the house, Nancy, let Nancy Pelosi. Woah, you better get out and vote for Steve Watkins, please. A majority of House Democrats have already sponsored a socialist takeover of healthcare."
00:30:18 - 00:31:38 (80 sec),The Democrats' plan would eviscerate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for 20 million seniors. We want to protect Medicare we will as Republicans protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it. And we will always protract Americans with pre-existing conditions. We will take care of our great Americans with pre- existing conditions.
00:31:38 - 00:32:40 (63 sec),"Today's Democrats have embraced radical socialism and open borders. If you don't have borders, you don't have a country, folks, you don't have a country. Every single Democrat. In the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders and it's a bill, it's called The Open Borders Bill. What's going on? And it's written by -- Guess who?"
00:32:40 - 00:33:23 (42 sec),"Dianne Feinstein. Remember the leaking, right? The leakin' Dianne Feinstein. ""Did you leak? Did you leak, Dianne? Dianne, did you... "" ""No, no, no, I don't. No.No. I don't think. Wait. Did we leak? No, he said no, no we didn't leak."" Oh. Was that the worst body language you've ever seen? Was that the worst? ""No, I didn't leak. I didn't leak."" No she didn't leak. That's what you're dealing with."
00:33:23 - 00:34:12 (50 sec),"If the Democrats bill ever becomes law, a tidal wave of drugs and crime would pour into our nation like never ever before. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities that release violent predators and bloodthirsty killers like MS-13 into our communities. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens"
00:34:12 - 00:34:57 (45 sec),"And Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE, border patrol, and law enforcement. They wanted the fund ICE. Can you believe it? You know how tough  ICE is? When MS-13 sees ICE coming, they say, ""Let's get out of here."" But you know what? They can't, because they get caught, they get thrown, and they get thrown the hell out of the country. They can't."
00:34:57 - 00:35:37 (39 sec),"They don't like that. The Democrats want to get rid of ICE. So these are great Americans. By the way, ICE, great Americans. They happen to be tough people. I think we need some tough people, they're tough. MS-13 doesn't like ICE and that's why I like ICE. But they really are, they're great Americans, they love our country and they're not treated properly,  they're not treated properly."
00:35:37 - 00:36:00 (24 sec),"I've seen it in Long Island. They go into a community. I've grew up in that vicinity, I know every community out there. And they go into these communities and these are rough,  rough people, MS13, how they even come in and we stop them at the border but there's so many here from before us, from before us, and our laws are so bad and we're getting them changing stuff."
00:36:00 - 00:36:52 (52 sec),"That's why we need more Republicans. But they come in and -- Long Island, we send ICE and they get in there and they get them out, and it's like we're liberating a town. In this day and age it's like in a war, where you know, you're a foreign invader -- a foreign invader, finally, is being taken out. They're liberating a country or liberating a city or town."
00:36:52 - 00:37:42 (50 sec),"These people are liberating these towns, and you know the story, and you've heard it, it's all over. They cut people up because they don't want to use bullets, it's too fast and it's not painful enough. And then when I said. ""Animals!"" Nancy Pelosi said, ""How dare you speak that way about a human being. How dare you.""  Right? This woman just said it to me. She screamed out of the word animal, so how dare you call them."
00:37:42 - 00:38:10 (29 sec),"They're human beings and not -- these are animals folks. These are animals. And we need law enforcement, and we need ICE and we need border patrol. These are great people. And if your community has a problem, don't worry about it just give us a call, we'll take care of it. Democrats are also fighting to give welfare and free healthcare to illegal aliens paid for by you, the American taxpayer. Thank you very much."
00:38:10 - 00:38:33 (22 sec),"Republicans believe that the public benefits must be protected for the truly, needy Americans. Americans that need help, not illegal aliens. If you want safe. If you want a border. If you want America to remain a sovereign great country then you must organize, mobilize, register, and vote Republican."
00:38:33 - 00:38:52 (19 sec),"We need more Republican votes. This election is about safety. And it's also about prosperity. Since the election, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. And we've added nearly one-half million manufacturing jobs. Think of that. If I ever said that during the cam -- look how many. Oh, man, that you are getting more and more people back there."
00:38:52 - 00:39:07 (16 sec),"Look how many reporters. Look. Wow, that's a lot. Wow. Wow. You know I call it? I call it the Academy Awards. That's the  Academy Award. You know we're doing great. Our new polls just came out. I had a poll, Rasmussen 51 or 52, they don't report that, they never report."
00:39:07 - 00:39:49 (41 sec),"But you know -- and It's much higher than that because some people -- I don't know if I'm happy about this, they say when they don't want to talk about it that means they're voting for Trump, I don't know, am I supposed to be thrilled? But we'll take it, right? Well take it. That's what happened in 2016. A lot of people didn't want to talk about it and the pollsters puts it down. OK, so -- but now they learned, they learned their lesson. When they don't talk they had Trump voters."
00:39:49 - 00:40:26 (38 sec),"All action. All action, no talk. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in recorded history. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. By the way, by the way, can you imagine during the debate if I have those stats, the best unemployment number ever for African-Americans. Best in terms of poverty ever in history for Africa."
00:40:26 - 00:41:02 (36 sec),"How do you win? How do you beat us on that? It's only habit. It's habit. Because for a hundred years, African-Americans have gone with Democrats but now they're changing, and they're changing fast and they're coming for us. Thank you, Kanye West. Thank you, Jim Brown. Big Jim Brown. Thank you, Iron Mike. I could go through -- We have so many people."
00:41:02 - 00:42:21 (79 sec),"Big Jim Brown. We could use him right now in the NFL, right? Great people. Hispanic- American and Asian-American, likewise, their unemployment rates have also reached all- time historic lows. The lowest. And women's unemployment just fell to 3.6%,  the lowest rate in 65 years. And we are, as of right now, the world's No.1 producer of crude oil and natural gas. Energy. No. 1.  No. 1. And since I took office, the value of Americans mutual funds and pension funds has increased by $2.7 trillion. That's your money, that's your money. And your 401(k)s. You all look like a bunch of geniuses, thank you, Donald, very much. You're all great investors, right?"
00:42:21 - 00:42:54 (33 sec),"You're all great investors. That's all good. We've picked up 11 -- I would say 10, I was saying seven. We picked up now 11.7% Larry Kudlow said it to me the other day, said, ""Sir, you're a little lower in that number.""  I said, ""Really?"" I was using $10 trillion. It's now $11.7 trillion in worth."
00:42:54 - 00:43:26 (32 sec),"Eleven. You know what that is? And China was catching us rapidly before I became president. And right now we are going so fast, we are the fastest developing country in the world. Can you believe that? Boom. Fastest in the world. [Crowd cheering] And that's why I say, ""We have a midterm coming up, an election."" Historically whoever's president -- I don't know why this works, but whoever's -- I guess people get complacent."
00:43:26 - 00:44:08 (42 sec),"You know, ""Hey, we just won the presidency."" Now two years later we have an election, so they are complacent and then we always win in the next one, which is, as you know, the presidential election. We always... So far I'm dreaming of those candidates. I see those candidates before my eyes."
00:44:08 - 00:44:54 (45 sec),"Every night before I go to sleep, sometimes while I'm sleeping I love them so much. Cory Booker, Pocahontas, Pocahontas. I've got more Indian blood in me than Pocahontas, and I have none, I mean, sadly I have none, but I have more than she does. They said to her, ""Why do you say you're of Indian heritage?"" Well, my mother told my high cheekbones that's the answer."
00:44:54 - 00:45:39 (46 sec),"Do you have any documentation? No, we don't. ""Oh, I see. Your high cheekbones."" Well I have high cheekbones too. Hey, maybe I'm an Indian and I'm going to do very well. But think of it. This is her reason. The whole thing has been [Inaudible] but that's OK. You know what, I want to be careful. I'm taking out so many of these people, I'm hitting them so hard that they're disappearing and I don't want to do that because I make it somebody that's actually good to run against me and that would not be good."
00:45:39 - 00:46:34 (55 sec),"I'll take out all the easy ones and maybe I'll get stuck with somebody that's actually good,  but I don't see any on that side. Well, Sleepy Joe Biden, who -- who ran for president two or three times, you know they say only twice. I think I remember a third time in there. But he had 1% with an arrow pointing left."
00:46:34 - 00:47:23 (50 sec),"That means 1% or less. And then Obama took him off the trash heap while he's one of the people. Remember he challenged me to a fight? ""I'd like to take him behind the bar."" I love that. That would be great. That would not last long. That would not last long. That wouldn't last long. Go like this. He's down. And he'll never get up. He will never get up. He will never get up. Now I got to leave their candidates alone."
00:47:23 - 00:47:42 (18 sec),"Somebody actually said, ""You're hitting these candidates really hard."" He's a non-candidate, you know, Don Mandic. He's a Da Nang Dick. He's Da Nang Dick. That's  Blumenthal. He talked about, ""When I was in Da Nang province in Vietnam and I was fighting up the hill in Minner going left and right of me they're dying."
00:47:42 - 00:48:17 (35 sec),"They're being struck by bullets but I went back to their rescue. I went back and I got them. And then I made a second attempt and bullets are going left and right and over my shoulders and they're hitting my men."" And I used to think, ""Wow, this guy is a pretty brave guy.""  And then I found out he's a fraud. He never was in Vietnam. And he stopped campaigning because there was no way you could win."
00:48:17 - 00:48:58 (41 sec),"No way. And because it's Connecticut, where I guess only a Democrat -- Can you believe this? That's why Connecticut's such a mess right now. Only a Democrat -- Wait, you're going to see, it's a mess. General Electric just moved out. That doesn't help. But Da Nang and Dick and then I see him yesterday talking about a man who's No. 1 at Yale, has like this perfect record."
00:48:58 - 00:49:42 (44 sec),"The most incredible record. One of the reasons I picked him. He's like a perfect person in Da Nang Dick, who -- who said he was a great war hero and he never saw the country. This wasn't like saying, ""Yeah. I was in the army."" This is -- this is the guy that said he was charged up Da Nang. Da Nang province right down Da Nang. He's up that hill and he's taking bullets left and right, and he never saw the place, he was in the reserves cell. Remember that."
00:49:42 - 00:50:07 (25 sec),"And he said, ""I demand honesty."" This is true, exact words. I demand honesty, integrity and I demand that there's no lying going on, and I'm saying, ""Wait a minute."" I said,  ""That's the guy that lied about -- in the worst -- in the history of our country. If you look at it,  he lied. And this is one of the people, how bad."
00:50:07 - 00:50:29 (23 sec),"And then you have the Feinstein and you have all the others and you look at what's going on. You don't want those people in office, folks. You've got to have great Republican. And compare that with what you've seen with John Cornyn, who asked a great question to Dianne and got her a little off base, like you know John Cornyn of Texas."
00:50:29 - 00:50:51 (22 sec),"And Lindsey Graham, who did such a great job. Right. Did a great job. How good was Lindsey? How good was Lindsey? And you know what? He was speaking from the heart. He was speaking. And by the way, took a week but that extra week was a great thing because it showed no corroboration, no nothing. By the way, no nothing. How good was Senator Susan Collins yesterday."
00:50:51 - 00:51:14 (23 sec),"Really, really great. And Chuck Grassley. I'll tell you what, Chuck was great. He's got to be very happy with what we did on trade. Right, Chuck? From Iowa, great state. And Mitch McConnell, how good, how good? He was tough and smart. He was great. He worked hard and we got ourselves the finest legal mind. One of the finest human beings."
00:51:14 - 00:51:46 (32 sec),"And again what his family took. The horror that they had to endure by these people like Blumenthal and Cory Booker who was a disaster as the mayor of Newark New Jersey. What they had to take was a disgrace. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning. All right. Tired of winning. We want to win, win, win. Never get tired of winning. After years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation. you see what's happening."
00:51:46 - 00:52:07 (21 sec),"And I just left the United Nations last week, and I can tell you, and everybody else can tell you, and even the fake news can tell you, America is respected again. To create more jobs and rising wages. Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history by far."
00:52:07 - 00:52:54 (48 sec),"We also passed Veterans Choice, 44 years, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor, and we pay for it so they don't have to wait in line for 25 days, 38 days, 14 days, six days. They go out and they see a private doctor, they get themselves a good doctor. We paid the bill. It's frankly so simple but it took 44 years to get it done."
00:52:54 - 00:53:42 (48 sec),"We got it done. I'm going to getting it done. I'm good at getting it done.Now we also passed, this is 45 years, the VA accountability law to insure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable, you are fired, get out."
00:53:42 - 00:54:07 (25 sec),"And we've secured a record, $700 million and the next year $716 billion to rebuild our military and to give our brave warriors the largest pay raise in almost a decade."
00:54:07 - 00:54:56 (49 sec),"And at my direction, The Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces the space force, a very serious stuff. That's happening quickly, it's very serious, that's where it's at. You know you have to know where it's at. Doesn't sound right, but it's right. That's where it's at."
00:54:56 - 00:55:20 (24 sec),"Both defense and offense that's where it's at. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. You know, before I became president, I looked at what was happening with Iran. They were taken over the Middle East, they were taking Syria. They were taking them."
00:55:20 - 00:56:22 (62 sec),"They were going into Iraq, they were taking everything. Now, they just want to make it, they just want to -- say they have riots in every city. Since I took over that operation, that horrible, horrible deal that was the thick of it. The previous administration gave Iran $150 billion and even crazier, they gave him at $1.8 billion dollars in cash. Cash."
00:56:22 - 00:57:07 (45 sec),"Airplanes. Airplanes full of cash. Fact I got in, I said, ""This is the president of the United States. I actually have the power to give away $1.8 billion in cash?"" You know what the answer is? It's actually no, they don't. What they did there is a disgrace. They gave them 1.8 in order to have a terrible deal."
00:57:07 - 00:57:45 (38 sec),"Well that was a hostage so they paid $1.8 billion. They paid $1.8 billion for hostages. Can you imagine? And we got our hostages back from North Korea, right? Noting. Zero. And we have a good relationship. And who knows what happens? But I think good things happen. No more missile testing, no more rocket testing, no more nuclear testing."
00:57:45 - 00:58:26 (41 sec),"We got the remains of our great, great heroes from 75 years ago back. And they keep coming back. And we got our hostages back. And good things are happening over there. You know what I always say is this, just before we signed the deal with Canada and Mexico, great deal, I said, ""Who knows?"" I never like to say -- how could you say? It's a deal."
00:58:26 - 00:58:56 (30 sec),"Who knows? I like to do -- it takes all the pressure off. Who knows? With North Korea, who knows? But I think we're doing very well. OK? The fake news says, ""Why aren't you going faster?"" I said, Listen, I just got back three months ago, right. I was there with Kim Jong-un. I was there three months ago. Chairman Kim."" They say, ""Why aren't you going faster?"
00:58:56 - 00:59:29 (32 sec),"I said, ""What have people done for 75 years? 75. This is three months."" And one of the Akers said, ""Why has the president given away so much? And I said, ""What have I given? I haven't given anything."" We've got our hostages back for nothing, out of respect. We got our remains back. We got the testing all stopped including the nuclear testing."
00:59:29 - 00:59:54 (26 sec),"I said, ""Tell me what have we given?"" ""Well, ah, ah, you -- you agreed to meet."" Oh, that does cost me very much, I agreed to meet. I like to meet. I like to meet. What the hell we lose by meeting. I asked the previous administration. Now that's what I gave away, I agreed to meet. Can you believe it? These people are sick. I agreed to meet."
00:59:54 - 01:00:25 (31 sec),"Can you imagine how well we do if we actually had fair press? Can you imagine? No, could you imagine? Instead of fake news. I agreed to meet. I'm sorry I agreed to meet. And then they said. right. You know, the rhetoric was extremely tough that first couple of months. And President Obama said at my meeting with him he said, ""The biggest problem we have by far is North Korea."""
01:00:25 - 01:00:42 (17 sec),"They would have gone to war. Millions and millions of people would have been killed. Millions of people. And I said to somebody in their administration. Have you ever talked? Have you ever agreed to meet? Have you ever like sit down and talk? ""Well we haven't thought about."" Oh, I see you're going to war, you're not going to talk."
01:00:42 - 01:01:02 (20 sec),"We'll beat anybody. What we have now coming in, I'm telling you it's the greatest power we've ever had, the greatest power in the world. You know why I have that? Because I don't want to use it. And when you have it, nobody is going to mess with us. OK. Nobody. I don't want to use it. Greatest power in the world."
01:01:02 - 01:01:33 (31 sec),"$716 billion, greatest power in the world. But we're doing great. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. That's the other story I tell. That's the other story we tell. That's a big one. That's a big, big story. You know why? Because other presidents all said, there are many, many presidents, ""We're going to do it. We're going to do it."""
01:01:33 - 01:01:44 (10 sec),"Then the pressure goes on and they don't do it. And I see why, I don't blame them. Every leader called me, ""Don't do it, please. Don't do it, don't do it."" You know the story I refused to take their phone calls."
01:01:44 - 01:02:05 (21 sec),"I said, ""Tell them I'll call them back on Thursday next week."" And I'm signing like on Wednesday. Tell him I'm calling him back on Thursday. I look forward to speaking to him. I signed the deal. Now's the deal, then I call him back. ""Yeah. Hi. How are you doing?  What's up?"" Wow. ""We wanted to talk to you about Israel but it's a little late."""
01:02:05 - 01:02:32 (27 sec),"And the embassy, which was going to cost over a billion dollars, we built it for about $400,000, right, you know that, right. And the billion would have taken probably 20 years before you ever got to build it. And we took a piece of land that we own, already own, and it had a building on it. OK building. We fixed the building up a little bit."
01:02:32 - 01:02:51 (19 sec),"We took the big space in the corner. We used even Jerusalem stone, which is a very expensive if you're a building. Jerusalem stone is beautiful. How nice is that? And you know Jerusalem stone in Jerusalem sounds about right. We got it for the right price. And we built it for less than $500,000. Now think of it."
01:02:51 - 01:03:30 (39 sec),"And we opened it up and it's open now, we have our embassy. So we saved a billion dollars in twenty years and we have our embassy. We could do that with hundreds of this. For years you watched as your leaders apologize for America and now you have a president who is standing up for America. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Kansas and we're standing proudly."
01:03:30 - 01:04:29 (58 sec),"We're standing proudly for our great national anthem, right. I just helped Canada and the NFL make a deal that they've been trying to make for years. Can you believe it? Canada was taking advantage of the NFL. The NFL couldn't get it done. It took me about two seconds because it's pea -- It's, you know, it's a lot of money but it's not compared to corn, and crops, and dairy, and milk, and cars, and steel, and everything else. It's peanuts. I say you got to take care of it right. Because I want to help American companies. It took me like two minutes and we get it done. And I got a call from the commissioner of the NFL and I thought he was calling me to ask me to stop haunting them about standing for the American flag and for our national.."
01:04:29 - 01:05:05 (36 sec),"And he didn't. He called me to thank me. He said, ""The previous administration could not get it done. And you got it done. We didn't even know what you were trying to do it."" So now they'll have a lot more money to give to their players and their players will still hate me, but that's OK. Stand for it, just as long as they stand. Just as long as they stand for our flag and our anthem I don't care how they feel about that."
01:05:05 - 01:05:33 (28 sec),"But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends your family your neighbors your co-workers and get out and vote Republican, we need more people in D.C.. We don't have enough. Vote to send Kris Kobach to the governor's mansion and vote to send Steve Watkins to Congress. We always vote for Trump."
01:05:33 - 01:06:01 (28 sec),"A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products made right here in the USA. Finally, finally. We want it made here. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement, and that's what they are. They're our heroes."
01:06:01 - 01:06:31 (30 sec),"And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division,  and destruction, and to reclaim America's true heritage and righteous destiny. We're losing that with these crazy loco people. To everyone in this room tonight, that's a lot of people, to every citizen watching across our land."
01:06:31 - 01:07:04 (33 sec),This is your time to choose. It's a time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustration of the past or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. It's not up to the media. It's not up to the pundits. It's up to you to decide your fate.
01:07:04 - 01:07:18 (14 sec),"And remember this, what happened in 2016, and what's happening even more so now, I believe, because I've produced, and people see I produced, one of them said, ""He made a lot of promises and he actually produced more than he made promises."""
01:07:18 - 01:07:51 (33 sec),"I mean, you know, think about it. I did. I did. You have the power with your vote. To defend your family, your community, your country, and everything we hold sacred, and righteous, and true. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to every day great American patriots."
01:07:51 - 01:08:20 (30 sec),"The state of Kansas was set up by tough pioneer men and strong women, who defied danger and brave the wilderness to build a beautiful life on the plains. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Strong Women, strong women, strong."
01:08:20 - 01:08:52 (31 sec),"I'm sorry, fellas, stronger than the men, I'm sorry, fellas. Strong. They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury but they all had one thing in common, they love their families, they love their country, and they loved their god."
01:08:52 - 01:09:29 (37 sec),"These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud and great American heritage. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children we are going to work, we are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win."
01:09:29 - 01:10:13 (44 sec),"We will not ban. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people. One Family. And one glorious nation under God."
01:10:13 - 01:10:42 (28 sec),"And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kansas. Thank you."
